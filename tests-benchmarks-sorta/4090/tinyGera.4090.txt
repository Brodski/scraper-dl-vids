[190.19s -> 196.76s]  Yeah, guy has G-P
[207.54s -> 215.06s]  Beast
[215.06s -> 254.21s]  Jesus
[254.21s -> 327.09s]  Yo, it was on man. It's up dudes. Yeah, I mean we're hoping we'll see man. We'll see
[330.21s -> 389.55s]  fingers fucking cross, right?
[389.55s -> 391.55s]  Do I ever actually
[405.49s -> 408.21s]  I'm wondering if I I'm assuming I'm just playing a math
[408.77s -> 484.16s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is probably just me doing fucking I'm probably just doing star guardian
[498.34s -> 502.48s]  Well come to the wall. It's never on time for the 27-months man, you're a
[503.46s -> 530.88s]  Appreciate the lot dude. Thank you, and I could probably still go in finneteen, but it's my hold in the solution
[531.68s -> 533.68s]  But I haven't seen any sever or anything
[534.80s -> 619.59s]  So I'd be kind of awkward, you know, this guy's definitely gonna be me. That guy's
[620.83s -> 624.83s]  I see why he hasn't lost. That's he has five infinity team already Jesus Christ
[626.11s -> 628.91s]  I was like man. Why's that guy so strong and then I like realized
[629.55s -> 780.90s]  So I go to seven next rounds, and then hopefully we could hit
[782.30s -> 806.04s]  Some shit. I kind of like this actually because now we can make
[807.52s -> 809.52s]  I can actually make a
[809.52s -> 811.52s]  Guard breaker and I can also make
[811.76s -> 849.08s]  We go like guard breaker and math. I kind of want to just iron-experc, but I don't know if I should. I need it
[850.76s -> 853.70s]  An echo, a Nico, or a ral
[853.70s -> 859.86s]  That's what could use an Ezreal. I need like a quick draw. I should have kept that
[859.86s -> 879.20s]  moot shins from earlier. This guy's a level 3 Blitzcrank and he's just so fucking strong
[879.20s -> 957.96s]  at stupid. This is really interesting. I guess I could go spell-singer as well.
[957.96s -> 1036.95s]  Whoever you just give the shiv to TF. Let me just do this for now too. I guess I could use...
[1036.95s -> 1049.69s]  I could do dual gauntlet. I don't know. Could dual gauntlet this shit up? See how it goes?
[1049.69s -> 1111.88s]  I need to like throw an item down, but I feel like Morelos is bad. I guess I could just use hat
[1112.44s -> 1146.74s]  Or I guess I have to afford your old gotlet could be good. Oh, no. I could just roll on seven two
[1146.74s -> 1154.00s]  Try and three stars stuff. This guy has three cices though
[1154.60s -> 1161.90s]  This guy has one cice. It's kind of hard to three star cice. I could three-star niva
[1162.64s -> 1193.12s]  They're guys all eight with fucking 20 gold
[1195.04s -> 1197.04s]  Here he has MF
[1197.84s -> 1354.38s]  And, what's crazy, it's insane.
[1354.38s -> 1356.34s]  You that NAR just murked me.
[1357.46s -> 1371.48s]  I did not position for the NAR, and I got fucked for it.
[1371.48s -> 1399.28s]  This motherfucker.
[1399.28s -> 1402.92s]  Did I wish I could get some stick frontline leveled up?
[1404.04s -> 1405.04s]  That'd be cool.
[1458.65s -> 1542.29s]  Oh my god, another NAR.
[1542.29s -> 1543.85s]  Well, rip.
[1543.85s -> 1546.45s]  I wasn't gonna go MF, and then I decided to go Niko,
[1546.45s -> 1572.44s]  I just fucked it all up. Oh wow, time is it 10?
[1619.09s -> 1635.52s]  What's up boys? That's how everybody doing. Oh I'll be right back.
[1643.24s -> 1645.40s]  So I'm still waking up with me. Give me one sec.
[1645.40s -> 1648.40s]  Oh, okay.
[1648.40s -> 1675.68s]  Ooh.
[1675.68s -> 1676.68s]  Oh yeah, baby.
[1676.68s -> 1684.38s]  I was gonna play on my main at the start, but dude, I don't know if I can sit through
[1684.38s -> 1688.38s]  fucking eight minute queue times to get people raging at each other all day.
[1688.38s -> 1702.80s]  So we'll do some warm up on this account for a bit.
[1702.80s -> 1704.80s]  What a Mars account.
[1704.80s -> 1713.56s]  Like D1, Bo Master.
[1713.56s -> 1715.56s]  Like by their accounts, like 500.
[1715.56s -> 1717.56s]  This one's, I want to say like,
[1717.56s -> 1723.56s]  I don't know, the NMR is really awkward when you get like well masters, right? Like the MR Super awkward.
[1723.56s -> 1730.56s]  So I don't know what the MR is, but I know it's a little masters, so like sometimes there's the I'm in sometimes there's like 100 LP players.
[1730.56s -> 1745.66s]  Somewhere between there. Dude, I, I, I put some games off stream yesterday, I got up to like 400 LP.
[1745.66s -> 1749.66s]  Then I've lost three in a row. That shit was painful.
[1749.66s -> 1766.88s]  I did into one of tenacity's games though, so that was fun. That felt bad.
[1770.00s -> 1776.98s]  Yeah, straight up. It felt so bad. He was doing so good too. Like I straight up just had a bad game and I felt I felt like shit
[1779.43s -> 1782.07s]  I dropped like eight deaths. Look at the shit
[1785.03s -> 1793.23s]  Like he was just straight up smurfing on the enemy top laner and we all the entire team just like decided to collectively run it down
[1793.71s -> 1802.04s]  Like we all just got shit on
[1802.04s -> 1805.00s]  This was a really weird game because I feel like
[1808.23s -> 1814.39s]  That game was like the first game I felt everybody in the game was like actually high GM Challenger, but they weren't rated that
[1814.95s -> 1824.18s]  It was a very weird system going on. It's doing a Cassiopeia game
[1824.62s -> 1838.95s]  But all this thing you guys what I mean in a second I'm assuming I should go this right?
[1839.49s -> 1846.51s]  This is probably good
[1846.51s -> 1848.01s]  Or this
[1848.01s -> 1857.46s]  That's probably good too. Oh, well, okay, so yeah, look at this stuff
[1857.46s -> 1863.46s]  Like, Nian Tonso is like, he's been traveling for a long time, right?
[1863.46s -> 1866.46s]  I don't even know who the fuck this guy was.
[1866.46s -> 1870.46s]  Some random sent-up player who's like, not playing sent-up now.
[1870.46s -> 1876.86s]  And then this guy was like trying to jungle and just like running it down.
[1876.86s -> 1881.86s]  It was, I don't even know, it was the weirdest game that I've played in a while.
[1881.86s -> 1885.86s]  Because like, my 80 carry wasn't bad.
[1885.86s -> 1890.86s]  like this guy is clearly like on a smurf, but I don't know how good he was because he wasn't bad at the game.
[1890.86s -> 1893.86s]  The enemy 80 carry wasn't bad.
[1893.86s -> 1896.86s]  This guy's also on a smurf.
[1896.86s -> 1900.86s]  It was the weirdest lobby. It was like a bunch of smurf accounts.
[1900.86s -> 1908.09s]  All playing with each other, but it was like a non smurf queue.
[1908.09s -> 1910.09s]  This guy was like the only non smurf.
[1910.09s -> 1922.97s]  It was interesting.
[1922.97s -> 1924.97s]  Ooh, do I take ghost here? Or do I just...
[1924.97s -> 1930.53s]  I think Ghosts could be really OP versus their team with Cassiopea, but maybe I should
[1930.53s -> 1944.18s]  just take... I'm gonna try it, I don't know, somebody dodged, cause yeah, I don't know,
[1944.18s -> 1949.06s]  I never know, I never know if you should take Ghosts, Ignite, whatever.
[1949.06s -> 1952.46s]  Cause I feel Ghosts with Cassiopea's feels like the same exact E-carrier, right?
[1952.46s -> 1965.84s]  Same idea, where it feels really OP, dude, there's so much drama going on in the lead
[1965.84s -> 1995.86s]  community yet again, by the way, like it's, it's insane, yeah, I don't know, man.
[1995.86s -> 1997.86s]  I
[1997.86s -> 2001.30s]  I just I'm
[2004.98s -> 2008.02s]  I like I like looking at drama because like
[2008.74s -> 2016.80s]  Drama is juicy like I like looking at drama, but it's also like how are people so stupid?
[2033.74s -> 2035.74s]  Yeah, I'm getting like I
[2036.38s -> 2043.82s]  I don't know man my view on all of this shit is like I guess I'm just not hardwired that way
[2044.38s -> 2049.34s]  I can't mentally wrap my head around being like excited the fort with underage girls
[2050.14s -> 2057.44s]  Or like when like I just I never like had the want
[2060.91s -> 2062.91s]  Like it happens so much
[2064.87s -> 2069.99s]  Between the like league streamers and non like just it's not even a league thing. It's just that we're in the league community right so you see it more
[2070.75s -> 2074.35s]  dude like well the drama is like a
[2075.59s -> 2080.75s]  Decent sized league streamer who is like getting bigger or whatever like the 80-carry streamer cookie roll over whatever
[2081.11s -> 2082.47s]  he was like
[2082.47s -> 2084.47s]  Somebody made a 90-page
[2084.47s -> 2096.16s]  90 pages of Google Docs to basically expose this guy for like talking a bunch like
[2096.16s -> 2102.34s]  sexually to underage girls not paying as fucking like mods who do work for him and like
[2102.34s -> 2120.40s]  other stuff and I'm like dude how man like just be a normal human it's not that bad
[2120.40s -> 2202.03s]  Like I take it for me being a normal dude. It's not that bad. Sorry. I was distracted. No
[2202.77s -> 2208.13s]  Yeah, I don't know man. I swear to God people are just stupid as fuck people are idiots
[2210.09s -> 2215.59s]  There's gotta be some psychological underlying issue with people's brains not working, but it is what it is
[2218.90s -> 2221.16s]  Huh, I found this book I look out for a while
[2221.16s -> 2222.00s]  Wow.
[2222.00s -> 2223.16s]  Hmm.
[2223.16s -> 2224.72s]  Ugh.
[2224.72s -> 2234.20s]  Dude, what is that tarry skid?
[2234.20s -> 2235.52s]  You see this?
[2235.52s -> 2237.80s]  Look at this tarry skid, Maddie's fabulous.
[2237.80s -> 2238.96s]  Got there.
[2238.96s -> 2242.48s]  My man, it's just straight of fabulous.
[2242.48s -> 2257.56s]  People are desperate.
[2257.56s -> 2260.56s]  I just can't, like, I don't think, like,
[2260.56s -> 2263.20s]  I've been in the situation where I was like a really,
[2263.20s -> 2266.28s]  really big streamer, like much bigger than he is.
[2266.28s -> 2269.20s]  And I got, like, this is what I'm saying is like,
[2269.20s -> 2274.64s]  I understand all of the crap that gets thrown at you.
[2274.64s -> 2277.64s]  People will literally message you for no reason.
[2277.64s -> 2284.32s]  You do have fans that have, when I was at my biggest point, you have fans that are younger.
[2284.32s -> 2286.48s]  Girls, it doesn't matter.
[2286.48s -> 2292.04s]  I just never, in my mind, I guess, thought, oh, I'm going to flirt with these people.
[2292.04s -> 2302.95s]  It made me, I literally didn't even see them as sexual in my brain.
[2302.95s -> 2307.30s]  I get blows my mind.
[2307.30s -> 2310.58s]  And then the fact that like, if you look at the Google
[2310.58s -> 2313.54s]  Doc or whatever, the fact that like,
[2313.54s -> 2315.14s]  Taco, like I keep a Taco or whatever,
[2315.14s -> 2316.86s]  was it literally talking to him?
[2316.86s -> 2318.66s]  Telling him he was doing it, like what he was doing
[2318.66s -> 2319.50s]  was wrong?
[2319.50s -> 2321.06s]  He was like, yeah, I get it, right?
[2321.06s -> 2333.40s]  Then he did it again.
[2333.40s -> 2336.04s]  Dude, the set-alting the pussy,
[2336.04s -> 2338.40s]  that, I'll be on it.
[2338.40s -> 2340.60s]  That may be one of the funny lines I've ever heard.
[2355.44s -> 2359.44s]  I mean whatever you know I'm not here to kink shame whatever gets people off you know, maybe
[2360.44s -> 2362.44s]  Maybe that's a fetish. I don't know
[2395.63s -> 2399.58s]  Sounds either way
[2401.18s -> 2403.18s]  Don't worry we cannot talk about the drama real quick
[2403.82s -> 2405.82s]  We could talk about
[2406.82s -> 2427.23s]  How old and wash up wings that is though. I'm kidding
[2427.23s -> 2434.87s]  Yo, did you see on a wider note though, did you see Riot?
[2435.87s -> 2442.37s]  There was like a reddit thread or something where Riot was saying that they're like gonna try and do something about smurfing in the next few months.
[2442.87s -> 2446.25s]  I don't know what that means.
[2447.25s -> 2448.25s]  But,
[2448.25s -> 2458.81s]  Here's how it's something involving wings just between us.
[2458.81s -> 2460.81s]  Yeah, yeah, just between us and all the homies.
[2460.81s -> 2462.81s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, nobody else say anything. It's fine.
[2462.81s -> 2463.81s]  Yeah, no.
[2463.81s -> 2467.66s]  What's up?
[2467.66s -> 2480.06s]  My chatting snitches.
[2480.06s -> 2511.46s]  I was a teen. I made a montage of him having breakdowns in my games. Oh my god. That's amazing. Oh my god. That's amazing.
[2511.46s -> 2519.98s]  I feel like I need to pay you to see this montage. I will give you money.
[2519.98s -> 2548.33s]  I need this. This is important to me. Oh, I have a dude. You should see the I have so many rage
[2548.33s -> 2557.87s]  compilations about me it's crazy so many I had a I had a a Velonark for sure
[2557.87s -> 2567.35s]  I feel you just comes with like being a wage streamer
[2567.35s -> 2581.70s]  but players are not all mentally healthy let me let me tell ya thank you for
[2581.70s -> 2607.50s]  me I'd like to think I'm not a villain anymore fuck you I really want this
[2607.50s -> 2626.14s]  play it. Nice. Dude, a nibbius roaming. Why is there a WooCron just sitting top
[2626.14s -> 2644.46s]  by the way? That's actually hilarious. You know what's interesting. I feel like Terric
[2644.46s -> 2649.58s]  actually missed that stun. I was kind of siding that, but I feel like he missed that stun
[2649.58s -> 2675.90s]  somehow. I feel like this is the easiest game I've ever played by the way. I'm on full auto
[2675.90s -> 2681.74s]  Pilots rain still waking up, and I feel like they're just walking into me on repeat. I'm just killing them all
[2682.46s -> 2684.46s]  I don't even know the fuck's going on
[2685.50s -> 2690.78s]  My day it feels like the enemy team has not like they didn't they didn't like understand we were playing league
[2691.22s -> 2693.66s]  Right like they queued up and they were like, oh, yeah, this is league
[2694.94s -> 2696.94s]  That's what this feels like
[2697.66s -> 2701.58s]  This is what I imagine if I might Tyson wanting to a preschool, you know, and I mean like this is what this feels like
[2701.58s -> 2723.28s]  Like, muck, say!
[2733.78s -> 2738.18s]  I probably could have killed those guys, but I don't know one of the chill.
[2747.39s -> 2749.59s]  I'm assuming the blue-con was gonna come bot soon.
[2754.66s -> 2755.46s]  There he is.
[2762.43s -> 2763.63s]  Damn it, I quence late.
[2764.83s -> 2766.03s]  I actually kill Bull.
[2767.23s -> 2768.63s]  That's a late quence by me.
[2769.43s -> 2770.03s]  Bye, bud.
[2771.63s -> 2773.83s]  Hmm, I don't want to take the risk of my backup.
[2775.03s -> 2776.83s]  She stuns me, they can one shot me.
[2776.83s -> 2779.83s]  I should have killed the fucking guy though.
[2780.83s -> 2785.83s]  The Wukong, I just backed up too far and then I coined the sun for no, like really late.
[2785.83s -> 2796.44s]  Roger, it was a man.
[2796.44s -> 2799.44s]  So boys, good evening, good evening, good morning.
[2799.44s -> 2802.44s]  I don't know where the fuck you guys live, so good day.
[2802.44s -> 2816.63s]  Fuck about watching.
[2816.63s -> 2827.43s]  Wait, that Wukong lived.
[2827.43s -> 2834.20s]  Whoa, bro.
[2834.20s -> 2838.58s]  Oh, and I'm dead.
[2838.58s -> 2841.58s]  Dude, that wall was BS.
[2841.58s -> 2847.58s]  I was like a little hole and then I flashed the light because I was like, oh, I could walk out the hole.
[2847.58s -> 2849.58s]  But I couldn't walk out the tiny little hole.
[2849.58s -> 2853.14s]  Not a buckers.
[2853.14s -> 2857.14s]  I shouldn't have even been there, but like, I'm stupid.
[2857.14s -> 2863.21s]  I should have just pushed bot.
[2863.21s -> 2865.21s]  I was like, dude, that's such a bad fight, but I walked over to it.
[2865.21s -> 2867.21s]  I was like, I'm really thin.
[2867.21s -> 2875.48s]  Honestly, I probably could have killed him if I didn't flash the stun.
[2875.48s -> 2877.48s]  Annie stuns the only
[2878.04s -> 2883.80s]  Like most over like I swear if if they reduced Annie stun about like 0.5 seconds she would never get played
[2885.08s -> 2890.00s]  Like actually the only reason to play Annie is her stun is just so OP
[2890.68s -> 2894.12s]  Because it's like a it's like the reason they changed Terrix a long ago
[2894.44s -> 2896.84s]  Where I like when you have a point click CC
[2900.30s -> 2912.26s]  It's typically really broken. Okay, I'm just dead
[2912.26s -> 2921.95s]  He said, there's Tarrick not have old level up, it's six.
[2921.95s -> 2941.04s]  He didn't level his ulti.
[2941.04s -> 2945.35s]  Maybe it's, maybe Tarrick old sucks.
[2945.35s -> 2946.79s]  Maybe it's under power.
[2946.79s -> 2947.95s]  You know?
[2947.95s -> 2959.44s]  Now, yeah, you must have missed quick.
[2959.44s -> 2960.70s]  Honestly, I was briefing.
[2960.70s -> 2962.80s]  I'm like, applying to Agro for like,
[2962.80s -> 2965.80s]  like, I threw my lead because I was like,
[2965.80s -> 2968.12s]  oh, shit, I'm gonna walk over and help the homies.
[2968.12s -> 2969.56s]  You never walk over and help the homies
[2969.56s -> 2970.84s]  when the homies are getting shit on,
[2970.84s -> 2974.52s]  because if you have like nine under gold or a thousand gold,
[2974.52s -> 2976.84s]  but you like, like I did or whatever, you don't want to do that
[2976.84s -> 2980.28s]  because you'll give MF a ton of kills.
[2983.74s -> 2995.56s]  We're in a good spot now though, but I am still a little,
[2996.52s -> 2998.28s]  wait, Terc, oh, we've leveled this old matters.
[3000.83s -> 3002.99s]  This Terc does not know how to play Terc, by the way.
[3005.37s -> 3007.05s]  He's thrown out his stun so awkwardly.
[3011.13s -> 3013.85s]  That's okay though. I mean, I apparently don't know how to play Dragon, so.
[3013.85s -> 3027.29s]  Okay, I'm really pulling the guy. I mean, you guys are doing dragon with no smite
[3031.27s -> 3046.67s]  But it seems like doing dragon with no smite. I mean, we could fight these fights, but
[3048.27s -> 3057.61s]  It's like painful. We could easily fight these fights. I think a lot of it is just like
[3058.37s -> 3062.97s]  Tarric isn't confident enough to walk up and stun, right? Like that's that's what I'm seeing the issue is
[3063.37s -> 3068.09s]  He's doing the thing where like he's not he doesn't have the confidence to actually walk up since he's a melee champ
[3068.81s -> 3076.27s]  So he's walking up in like taking half his health and it's making him nervous
[3077.27s -> 3080.49s]  It happens a lot with players who are very
[3081.23s -> 3083.23s]  Mail aid champ centric
[3083.83s -> 3086.99s]  Because melee supports are actually pretty risky are they're pretty scary rather
[3097.52s -> 3099.68s]  Always totally dead. Oh no, we're not
[3100.16s -> 3103.84s]  But yeah, melee supports are scary to play because you have to know
[3105.20s -> 3108.16s]  When you can get a kill by going in because you're gonna take damage, right?
[3108.16s -> 3112.66s]  That's just like the nature of melee supports.
[3112.66s -> 3117.95s]  Nice.
[3117.95s -> 3121.45s]  We're coming back in a bit, not bad.
[3121.45s -> 3124.45s]  We threw a little bit early, but yeah, we're starting to get back.
[3124.45s -> 3127.28s]  We're chillin'.
[3127.28s -> 3129.28s]  Tanks are never gonna.
[3129.28s -> 3133.28s]  I'm always confused by Terek because he feels like such a good champion.
[3133.28s -> 3136.28s]  Like the champion itself feels broken as shit.
[3136.28s -> 3141.28s]  Like whatever I see, Terek, I think to myself like...
[3141.28s -> 3148.28s]  the
[3148.28s -> 3151.28s]  he's either uncaly like super OP or
[3151.28s -> 3153.28s]  they're like
[3153.28s -> 3169.94s]  a 110
[3169.94s -> 3172.94s]  there's no in between right like they either know how to play terror they don't is what feels like
[3172.94s -> 3174.94s]  oh you're I mean yeah you're wrong terror actually requires mechanics
[3174.94s -> 3176.94s]  that's actually true
[3176.94s -> 3180.18s]  There's like most supports, like not as they don't have mechanics, you know?
[3180.18s -> 3182.10s]  And like what's correct, doesn't have mechanics.
[3182.10s -> 3187.28s]  They just hit their button and if it works, they're gonna kill.
[3187.28s -> 3191.18s]  There's like, Terric, after you've done, there is like stuff you have to do.
[3191.18s -> 3207.39s]  That does make sense.
[3207.39s -> 3210.44s]  Or, block.
[3210.44s -> 3214.16s]  Do you think, um, oh, I'm gonna die.
[3214.16s -> 3219.25s]  Oh, thank God.
[3219.25s -> 3221.29s]  Do you think Terric's one of the harder supports?
[3221.29s -> 3225.61s]  I think he's pretty hard.
[3225.61s -> 3232.61s]  I don't think he's, I mean, he's harder than the other supports, like I think like, I don't think there's a single support that's hard.
[3232.61s -> 3241.97s]  I know, I'm toxic for that, but I stand by it.
[3241.97s -> 3258.38s]  I mean, I'm just gonna die. I'm not gonna try and flash.
[3258.38s -> 3267.38s]  I don't think I should have just flashed over, but I kind of got baited by the terraculte. I wanted to see if I could fight it, but there's too much to see.
[3267.38s -> 3270.38s]  I was like, oh, he's alting me, let's go.
[3270.38s -> 3275.76s]  I can tell this is a really low-Elogam because there's so much random deaths.
[3275.76s -> 3278.76s]  Like, I'm falling victim to like, I'm autopyrting.
[3278.76s -> 3281.76s]  And like, I'm not thinking, and I'm just talking to you guys,
[3281.76s -> 3283.76s]  and I'm just dying for free.
[3283.76s -> 3286.76s]  But it's like, there's so many people who died for free.
[3286.76s -> 3287.76s]  It's hilarious.
[3287.76s -> 3289.76s]  Dresh? Dresh isn't actually that far.
[3289.76s -> 3293.76s]  So, like, a lot of people think like,
[3293.76s -> 3297.76s]  the rush mechanically is very difficult because he is harder than the other supports.
[3297.76s -> 3304.28s]  But he's not actually that hard. He's like once you learn the thresholds combos, he's pretty much
[3306.04s -> 3313.59s]  A very up front champion. Yeah, like
[3317.42s -> 3323.10s]  Like lantern for example is one of the most broken things to ever be put in league and everybody fucks it up
[3323.78s -> 3330.66s]  Like people will well, we'll just mess up lantern because they'll throw it for souls or they'll mess up like you can literally just hold lantern perma
[3331.38s -> 3333.38s]  And your 80 carry can walk up
[3334.86s -> 3339.10s]  auto the turret and and you literally like they literally can't play the game after that
[3345.40s -> 3348.52s]  like the enemy team i mean because like there's nothing they can do to stop it
[3350.70s -> 3352.06s]  we can totally fight this by the way
[3353.58s -> 3356.86s]  so i got done that before we're like my thrash where i know i have a good throw
[3356.86s -> 3358.70s]  hold on let me i mean when this team fight really quick
[3360.62s -> 3387.04s]  give me second okay cool sorry i had the i had the when that team fight really quick okay so
[3387.04s -> 3392.16s]  as i was saying uh there's a lot more to thrash than people think right
[3392.16s -> 3399.30s]  It's essentially people over-complicate like what he needs to do so it's like thrashes a very basic
[3399.30s -> 3404.58s]  Like when you see thrashing properly you you don't ever see like what you do but it's very rare that you see like the sick
[3405.30s -> 3410.28s]  Permal-hooking like oh my god like it's mainly like they pick him for like lantern
[3411.44s -> 3416.48s]  It's right up like when they pick thrashing high, oh, he's not picked to be the god tier like
[3416.48s -> 3419.76s]  like always landing permissacy hooks like Flay God.
[3419.76s -> 3422.80s]  Like he's picked to like shut down and gauge,
[3422.80s -> 3427.40s]  and remove kill threat to your carries.
[3427.40s -> 3431.06s]  That's always picked for.
[3431.06s -> 3435.25s]  But he's literally just an EW bot.
[3435.25s -> 3436.09s]  Armor stacking?
[3436.09s -> 3438.13s]  I mean, yeah, the armor thing on Thresh is nice,
[3438.13s -> 3442.87s]  but I wouldn't say it's like OP on his kit.
[3442.87s -> 3450.24s]  It just makes him like not died to 80 carries in two seconds.
[3450.24s -> 3453.80s]  What is happening?
[3453.80s -> 3456.52s]  But I instantly know on point where the good Thresh player,
[3456.52s -> 3458.28s]  when I can walk up to the turret.
[3462.10s -> 3475.94s]  When I can walk up to the turret and the threat.
[3475.94s -> 3478.14s]  Sorry, I was trying to think and talk at the same time.
[3478.14s -> 3479.22s]  When I can walk up to the turret,
[3479.22s -> 3481.78s]  my thrash player won't walk up and out of the turret with me.
[3481.78s -> 3484.50s]  That's like the sign of a good thrash player.
[3484.50s -> 3486.26s]  When we don't know where the enemy is
[3486.26s -> 3488.26s]  and instead of walking up and trying to hit the turret,
[3488.26s -> 3489.58s]  like help you kill the turret,
[3489.58s -> 3492.14s]  they'll stand in the back and literally just sit there
[3492.14s -> 3498.30s]  and wait and hold lantern until they just hold their lantern
[3498.30s -> 3501.70s]  until like you can enter you get ganked, essentially.
[3504.89s -> 3507.29s]  And that's why I guess I just personally don't think
[3507.29s -> 3509.85s]  Thresh is mechanics, there's hardest people think.
[3509.85s -> 3512.05s]  I do think he's very knowledge based.
[3512.05s -> 3514.45s]  I think Thresh has high knowledge caps.
[3514.45s -> 3516.57s]  Where if you're playing, I don't know, like,
[3516.57s -> 3519.57s]  Lulu, your skill is basically like,
[3519.57s -> 3522.57s]  do I W, your decision making on Lulu is literally,
[3522.57s -> 3525.53s]  do I W to speed or do I W to CC?
[3525.53s -> 3526.37s]  Right?
[3526.37s -> 3528.01s]  That's your decision making.
[3528.01s -> 3531.13s]  So it's like obviously much higher than that.
[3531.13s -> 3532.09s]  but it's a...
[3534.65s -> 3535.65s]  you son of a bitch.
[3536.53s -> 3538.41s]  But it's still not like that bad.
[3539.37s -> 3543.73s]  I think Thresh just intimidates people because he can do so much.
[3544.81s -> 3549.17s]  And so I think people just get intimidated, but because they think it looks overwhelming to learn the champ.
[3554.08s -> 3558.64s]  I feel like that actually intimidates a lot of people in terms of like people not wanting to
[3559.12s -> 3560.56s]  learn new champions and chips.
[3562.04s -> 3563.52s]  I feel like a lot of it is just...
[3563.52s -> 3572.40s]  people are nervous about learning champions that look overwhelming, right?
[3572.40s -> 3575.00s]  Like a fellow else, for example, I was talking about this yesterday.
[3575.00s -> 3577.40s]  A fellow else is not a hard mechanical champion.
[3577.40s -> 3582.90s]  Like, he's difficult in terms of the knowledge required.
[3582.90s -> 3585.90s]  Like, he's knowledge-gated, very hard, right?
[3585.90s -> 3589.90s]  So you have to play him a decent amount, or like research him,
[3589.90s -> 3594.40s]  to understand what guns do what, how to interact with the guns, stuff like that, right?
[3594.40s -> 3599.40s]  But the actual mechanics of using the guns, it's actually not hard.
[3600.40s -> 3601.40s]  Guys, what are we doing?
[3601.40s -> 3615.21s]  I guess we're just winning the fight.
[3618.93s -> 3621.37s]  Pike?
[3621.37s -> 3623.37s]  Like I think Pike's harder than Thresh.
[3626.58s -> 3629.58s]  Maybe that's a hot take, but I think Pike is harder than Thresh.
[3629.58s -> 3634.08s]  Because Pike requires like really specific.
[3635.08s -> 3642.78s]  Pike is a lot harder to play than he looks when you see people play him.
[3642.78s -> 3649.66s]  And because there's like timers of when you can go in off of certain things, like hitting
[3649.66s -> 3653.90s]  his old team consistently in team fights is a little harder than people think.
[3653.90s -> 3658.38s]  And knowing how to position in the lane, like, pikes capable of a lot more than people
[3658.38s -> 3659.38s]  think.
[3659.38s -> 3663.58s]  So I think the reason the main reason I think pikes a little harder is because he's
[3663.58s -> 3668.77s]  melee.
[3668.77s -> 3674.13s]  Like melee champions are always going to be like mechanically more difficult than ranged.
[3674.13s -> 3682.16s]  If the melee champion is like, you have to engage to go in and do stuff because there's
[3682.16s -> 3690.24s]  always the counterplay factor.
[3690.24s -> 3691.24s]  Support role.
[3691.24s -> 3692.24s]  Yeah.
[3692.24s -> 3695.96s]  I'm not saying overall, like overall range champions require a lot more mechanics than
[3695.96s -> 3700.96s]  melee, just because you're ranged, you can die in a global and you have to space and stuff.
[3700.96s -> 3705.96s]  But I think that like in just the support support specific, I think melee is a lot harder
[3705.96s -> 3706.96s]  to play.
[3706.96s -> 3710.56s]  That's why you see a lot of like support players.
[3710.56s -> 3712.26s]  We give like the best of boys in the world
[3712.26s -> 3714.82s]  are really good at like the engaged manly supports,
[3714.82s -> 3715.98s]  not the like in-chanters.
[3715.98s -> 3718.50s]  And that's why you see like why we praise
[3718.50s -> 3721.76s]  the best of our players.
[3721.76s -> 3723.16s]  Because like when you see somebody
[3723.16s -> 3725.68s]  going like perfectly on Rakan
[3725.68s -> 3727.32s]  or going like find a way in
[3727.32s -> 3730.82s]  without getting knocked up on like,
[3730.82s -> 3733.94s]  I don't know, something.
[3733.94s -> 3735.74s]  Like when they find the angle on thrash them,
[3735.74s -> 3747.96s]  it's really nice.
[3747.96s -> 3749.32s]  Rale.
[3749.32s -> 3750.56s]  I think Rale sucks.
[3750.56s -> 3752.52s]  I think that champ is so bad
[3752.52s -> 3761.26s]  because she just like, she doesn't do anything.
[3761.26s -> 3763.86s]  Like, Rels, Rels' initial thing was like,
[3763.86s -> 3767.10s]  she was supposed to go in, be really tanky,
[3767.10s -> 3769.50s]  and then be like a stun bot for like team fights.
[3769.50s -> 3771.06s]  She was a team fight monster.
[3771.06s -> 3773.26s]  But the problem with Rels is like,
[3773.26s -> 3776.06s]  she has one chance essentially in lane phase.
[3776.06s -> 3778.26s]  Like, if anybody has fingers on their hands,
[3778.26s -> 3780.26s]  and they can move left and right,
[3780.26s -> 3782.26s]  Rels really easy to dodge.
[3782.26s -> 3785.26s]  Like, it's incredibly easy to beat a Rel in lane,
[3785.26s -> 3787.34s]  and to not die to her.
[3787.34s -> 3789.46s]  Well, you just have to move less than right, right?
[3789.46s -> 3790.94s]  It's very simple.
[3790.94s -> 3796.86s]  So it's much more difficult to dodge like
[3796.86s -> 3798.46s]  other engaged champs if that makes sense.
[3798.46s -> 3800.26s]  Like, not a less, you can still move left and right,
[3800.26s -> 3802.90s]  but it's like, he can walk at you while it's happening.
[3802.90s -> 3804.86s]  Whereas like, if we're out, walks at you,
[3804.86s -> 3807.90s]  I'm still like just waiting for the animation
[3807.90s -> 3810.62s]  and then I can simply move to the left
[3810.62s -> 3814.90s]  because like her animation is so slow on using her ability
[3814.90s -> 3816.78s]  that I can like dash, I can flash.
[3816.78s -> 3819.14s]  like it, there's so much counter play.
[3819.14s -> 3820.82s]  And it's like, unless she flashes on you,
[3820.82s -> 3823.06s]  but even then you can tell she's gonna flash on you.
[3823.06s -> 3826.38s]  So it's like, I also feel like mid game,
[3826.38s -> 3830.54s]  Rell has this issue where she has her one trick
[3830.54s -> 3832.86s]  ulti engaged fight in team fights,
[3832.86s -> 3837.59s]  but after she does that, she does literally nothing.
[3837.59s -> 3841.30s]  She's like a one and done.
[3841.30s -> 3850.98s]  That's why she feels like she doesn't have other expression.
[3850.98s -> 3853.86s]  She's countered so hard by the meta, too.
[3853.86s -> 3855.86s]  Millio counters rowing edge.
[3856.86s -> 3859.66s]  Thresh counters rowing edge, right?
[3859.66s -> 3862.10s]  Like, either either of those champions
[3862.10s -> 3864.02s]  shits on rowing edge and you can't do anything.
[3864.02s -> 3877.90s]  Like, I don't know if you've ever tried to play Rell,
[3877.90s -> 3880.94s]  gone in and been like, thresholded,
[3880.94s -> 3883.74s]  but it's the worst feeling.
[3883.74s -> 3887.58s]  It's a bad feeling.
[3887.58s -> 3889.42s]  It's like when people play Leonid,
[3889.42s -> 3891.42s]  it's the same reason we own a shit right now.
[3891.42s -> 3895.30s]  Like, they both have the same idea of why they're bad, right?
[3895.30s -> 3900.30s]  They like have they're both good at doing what they're supposed to do like, you know,
[3900.30s -> 3906.30s]  stone and create pressure and point click and shit. But the problem is is like, you can easily
[3906.30s -> 3910.30s]  counterpeck them so incredibly hard that they just become worthless the whole game.
[3910.30s -> 3916.91s]  We've ever gotten sent a secondary mission all the time.
[3916.91s -> 3921.91s]  With sent up being like with thrashing meta and sent up being like a champion on playing a lot,
[3921.91s -> 3927.99s]  I get that all the time. You don't even notice it though. I'm going to be real.
[3927.99s -> 3931.63s]  when you kill the thrash or whatever and you get his souls you don't even
[3931.63s -> 3939.27s]  fucking notice it because like it's like 40 armor and it's like your level
[3939.27s -> 3943.71s]  17 or some shit at that point. Like at the point you're getting it you're
[3943.71s -> 3947.71s]  such a high level that like the 40 random armor like it's nice but I
[3947.71s -> 3958.80s]  never really notice it. Point to get your teammates ahead isn't that good. You don't
[3958.80s -> 3966.08s]  have actually been doing as support on my main account. I've actually been roaming
[3966.08s -> 3979.31s]  non-stop and it's super OP because the key to roaming is all you have to do to roam well
[3980.11s -> 3986.03s]  is literally be there one or two times in the first five minutes of the game to completely
[3986.03s -> 3992.75s]  fuck over the enemy one time on an engage or something and they get so far behind from it that
[3992.75s -> 4001.42s]  you can literally just walk back about like I do not send it like I'll push bot man this is my
[4001.42s -> 4005.66s]  my strategy and send. I'm going to give it to you guys. Okay. So I don't know if this
[4005.66s -> 4011.26s]  works in low elo, but in like masters like high masters, this works at least. This is all
[4011.26s -> 4015.82s]  I do in Senate. Every single player I play against on Senate, every single one except for
[4015.82s -> 4020.54s]  like Pike players, even not of us, but they all can see the lane level one. Every single
[4020.54s -> 4026.14s]  one of them, right? They just let me push level one. And so I'll push the waves in level one.
[4026.14s -> 4031.18s]  And I'll either crash, wave two or wave three, depending on how far they're giving me,
[4031.18s -> 4033.26s]  like push power, right?
[4033.26s -> 4036.18s]  So I will always crash wave two or wave three bot
[4036.18s -> 4041.18s]  and I will immediately roam in every time.
[4043.06s -> 4046.98s]  And even if I don't get a kill,
[4046.98s -> 4050.30s]  usually it fucks over the enemy midlaner so badly
[4050.30s -> 4053.10s]  because on that exact timer,
[4053.10s -> 4060.04s]  there's usually a gang happening on men.
[4060.04s -> 4063.48s]  So a lot of the time people think that you're roaming
[4063.48s -> 4070.04s]  to get a kill for the winner. You're not. You're roaming to counter pressure from the other
[4070.04s -> 4077.03s]  players in the game. How many times have you guys been like, oh, we can win this 2v2. You see
[4077.03s -> 4080.31s]  the enemy jungler, your jungler comes, you're like, oh, we're going to bathe this and then
[4080.31s -> 4084.23s]  all of a sudden the support shows up and you're like, God dammit and then you die and you're like,
[4084.23s -> 4090.63s]  what the fuck? That right there is how easy it is to play support because all you have to do is show up
[4090.63s -> 4102.54s]  up once twice. And now that entire of my aim is fucked for the enemy team, roaming
[4102.54s -> 4108.34s]  is so easy. The only thing people fuck up roaming really bad when they roam on timers
[4108.34s -> 4113.54s]  where they're 80 carry can't safely farm. So what ends up happening is on that timer,
[4113.54s -> 4118.26s]  right? Where I'm like, I told you way of two, three, right? What happens is you push that
[4118.26s -> 4123.66s]  wave and you roam in. Let's say nothing happens, okay? I can just walk back a bot. It's
[4123.66s -> 4125.14s]  you lose nothing.
[4125.14s -> 4126.38s]  And if usually at that point,
[4126.38s -> 4127.86s]  you have like three in our gold,
[4127.86s -> 4129.46s]  so there's no point backing, right?
[4129.46s -> 4130.62s]  Now, let's say like,
[4130.62s -> 4134.26s]  I noticed that my jungler is like invading topside.
[4134.26s -> 4136.30s]  I just walk over to top and help him.
[4137.54s -> 4141.98s]  Because you have like three to four waves
[4141.98s -> 4143.70s]  before the enemy bot lane,
[4143.70s -> 4150.78s]  the enemy bot lane has to play it almost perfectly
[4150.78s -> 4154.42s]  to be able to abuse your room on certain timers.
[4154.42s -> 4158.42s]  They essentially have to point perfect to abuse the run.
[4158.42s -> 4164.42s]  What I mean by that is like the best way to abuse a support roaming is you either A.
[4164.42s -> 4168.42s]  If you have the ability to dive, you can pretty much A.
[4168.42s -> 4172.42s]  Immediately dive, like push the next wave and then immediately dive.
[4172.42s -> 4176.42s]  If you have that ability, say you're playing with your own adrenaline or something.
[4176.42s -> 4183.42s]  But even then, it's a little risky because then the AD carry can just walk back and then we lose one wave and you gave up, you know, a stack chance.
[4183.42s -> 4185.22s]  so it's not that bad.
[4185.22s -> 4188.46s]  Two, you can stack the wave.
[4188.46s -> 4191.70s]  Now, stacking the wave is the best way to counter it,
[4191.70s -> 4194.30s]  because let's say I'm roaming for an extended period.
[4194.30s -> 4195.98s]  You stack like a three wave,
[4195.98s -> 4197.42s]  and then all of a sudden you're crashing it,
[4197.42s -> 4199.14s]  and then you want it like you're up a level
[4199.14s -> 4200.42s]  because you've been gaining XP,
[4200.42s -> 4202.30s]  and the 80 carry has the back off.
[4202.30s -> 4204.62s]  But the way to counter that is you simply
[4204.62s -> 4207.74s]  just walk back on the timer of the stacked wave crashing
[4207.74s -> 4209.70s]  as an 80 carry, or as a support.
[4209.70s -> 4211.74s]  It's so incredibly easy to do.
[4211.74s -> 4214.46s]  It's actually brainlessly easy to do.
[4214.46s -> 4218.46s]  Like, it's literally, you can roam all you want,
[4218.46s -> 4221.10s]  bot lane, as long as you are in bot lane
[4221.10s -> 4224.06s]  for the stacked wave crashes, or you are in bot lane
[4224.06s -> 4230.85s]  when your jungler is bot side of the map.
[4230.85s -> 4234.07s]  It's easiest fuck.
[4234.07s -> 4236.95s]  But support players, drill on themselves.
[4236.95s -> 4240.83s]  So they like to essentially support players
[4240.83s -> 4243.47s]  like to like AFK in the lane phase.
[4243.47s -> 4246.43s]  They like to literally sit there and just do nothing.
[4247.63s -> 4255.84s]  That's like the average support I see is they will stand and do nothing and and I've said this before
[4255.84s -> 4262.20s]  But I'll say it again being a good support is not being a better player than enemy team being a good support is queuing up to play League of Legends
[4263.70s -> 4269.24s]  That's that's all it takes all it takes the big good support is queuing up with the intent to push buttons in the game
[4270.12s -> 4501.48s]  And not just AFK all right, I'm back. What's up?
[4501.48s -> 4511.63s]  I don't remember we're talking about all supports. Yeah, they're all stupid don't
[4511.63s -> 4515.31s]  af can't support you'll gain LP it's that it's that it's actually that easy.
[4515.31s -> 4532.31s]  I want to say I don't think supports are stupid I think it's more of a how do I
[4532.31s -> 4539.20s]  phrase this it's in my opinion it's more of like a they're like they've never they
[4539.20s -> 4548.87s]  don't have to learn support players like don't have to learn important things
[4548.87s -> 4552.59s]  because they can get away with not doing it so they get they develop bad habits
[4552.59s -> 4562.83s]  That's all this.
[4562.83s -> 4564.83s]  Do I have a Spotify playlist?
[4564.83s -> 4569.76s]  Yeah.
[4569.76s -> 4572.04s]  Best role to climb.
[4572.04s -> 4573.96s]  I think every role is good to climb.
[4573.96s -> 4575.36s]  As long as you're good.
[4575.36s -> 4576.04s]  Classic Jarrah.
[4576.04s -> 4578.40s]  Oh, I don't see whatever you linked.
[4578.40s -> 4579.68s]  I don't know about links in the chat
[4579.68s -> 4583.00s]  because I had to turn them off a long time ago.
[4583.00s -> 4590.42s]  So I can't see this.
[4590.42s -> 4593.02s]  I would say the climbing is just about like whatever,
[4593.02s -> 4594.78s]  because every role you can climb on, right?
[4594.78s -> 4596.02s]  Like every single role.
[4596.02s -> 4604.84s]  So climbing a lot of the time is just about what you think
[4604.84s -> 4607.80s]  is most fun for you, and you can get the best ad.
[4607.80s -> 4612.00s]  I would say objectively, the best roles
[4612.00s -> 4614.88s]  to climb on are jungle and support for just like,
[4616.08s -> 4618.80s]  higher elo, well, jungle and lower elo,
[4618.80s -> 4622.60s]  support and higher elo, I wouldn't climb on support
[4622.60s -> 4626.16s]  in like gold, because you're not gonna have a good time
[4626.16s -> 4628.28s]  trying to like help bad players play the game.
[4629.76s -> 4632.60s]  Bad, it's mean, people who don't like,
[4632.60s -> 4637.60s]  You can get it like a gold as real 30 kills by being the better support, but you won't always win.
[4637.60s -> 4645.60s]  Whereas if you really want to control solo queue and your teammates aren't good enough to carry at that level by themselves,
[4645.60s -> 4659.12s]  you get frustrated. Just pick something that has more agency in the game.
[4659.12s -> 4662.12s]  You lost 18 or 24 as jungle, you want to turn your role.
[4662.12s -> 4669.12s]  I mean, you could play it. If you think it's, it is interesting. I wouldn't say it's like fun.
[4669.12s -> 4681.48s]  But it's not, it's not bad. You're in gold. I mean, you could try it.
[4681.48s -> 4684.48s]  My view on it is if people were wondering if they want to play a role or not.
[4684.48s -> 4687.48s]  My view is just try it. See if you like it because if you don't like the role,
[4687.48s -> 4691.48s]  you're not going to be able to put in enough games to get good at the role, right? So like,
[4691.48s -> 4695.48s]  just give it a try. See if you enjoy it or not. And if it's not fun,
[4695.48s -> 4700.80s]  Then if it's not your place style, it's not fun because 80's of our unique place style from all the other roles
[4702.20s -> 4709.72s]  Like the reason people don't like playing 80 carry and like like watching 80 carry streamers and shit
[4710.04s -> 4713.72s]  It's because it any carry is like it's boring
[4716.04s -> 4718.71s]  Any carry is like
[4718.71s -> 4723.11s]  Zero like like if there's a graph of shit going on when you're playing 80 carry in the game
[4723.11s -> 4724.11s]  It's like this
[4724.11s -> 4727.47s]  There's like spikes to a hundred and then it's back to like this, right?
[4728.19s -> 4732.20s]  It's like
[4732.20s -> 4735.08s]  Eighty carry is a lot of every game is different
[4735.96s -> 4737.96s]  Right every game any play 80's different
[4739.80s -> 4741.80s]  Because
[4741.80s -> 4747.16s]  You're always with a different player like a different support unless you do okay, so everybody carries games difference
[4747.80s -> 4749.80s]  Coupled with
[4750.04s -> 4754.04s]  You spend a lot of the game just farming, but you don't get to interact with the enemy a lot
[4754.04s -> 4759.04s]  So you just kind of farm a lot of the game and even then, you also like,
[4759.04s -> 4764.04s]  you basically are farming for like little dopamine hits of like team fights and stuff that you get around the game.
[4764.04s -> 4765.04s]  So that's kind of fun.
[4765.04s -> 4769.76s]  But it says, it's all you.
[4769.76s -> 4770.76s]  You can climb on any roll.
[4770.76s -> 4776.76s]  I think 80 carry requires the most mechanical skill to climb because the difference between,
[4776.76s -> 4780.76s]  climbing is like a jungler is about being in the right spot at the right time, right?
[4780.76s -> 4783.76s]  Like you need to path this way, get objectives, et cetera.
[4783.76s -> 4789.58s]  Climbing is an AD carry is more about like this person fucked up their positioning. I'm gonna kill them type shit
[4812.42s -> 4819.92s]  We're constantly queue. Also, I want to I want to say something
[4821.44s -> 4823.44s]  If you are playing
[4824.16s -> 4828.38s]  Make sure and this is just a really good standardized bit of advice
[4828.88s -> 4833.28s]  Make sure you're always tracking what the enemy cooldowns are what their spells are stuff like that
[4833.88s -> 4842.24s]  Okay, because playing the game is is not just about like farming and and you know, like your team goes in and you auto and shit
[4842.28s -> 4848.72s]  Like right now, mids me, all right. I can see that verus is me, but it is a verus. So like I'm not too worried about being like a little too
[4848.72s -> 4850.08s]  Viverus
[4850.08s -> 4853.74s]  Not that much right so I can kind of play backward because I know that
[4854.88s -> 4859.12s]  It's a high chance he's not gonna run bottom up a two as a verus now that was like a phase there's some shit
[4859.12s -> 4860.60s]  I immediately back up
[4860.60s -> 4865.16s]  So we noticed that it's pretty obvious recon probably got w level two. We don't know what it is
[4865.40s -> 4868.64s]  But he has Q so he doesn't have shield which means
[4869.32s -> 4876.05s]  Because he doesn't have shield
[4876.05s -> 4879.57s]  It's hard for the Recon to get back out if he fucks up an engage
[4880.41s -> 4885.61s]  So you need to think about these type of things, right now. This is way for I believe and because it's way for
[4886.21s -> 4891.29s]  We're gonna get level three on way four. You always get level three on way four if you have full XP
[4893.89s -> 4898.65s]  You get level two on wave two and you get level three on way four and
[4899.37s -> 4901.37s]  these timers for when you get
[4902.73s -> 4909.02s]  Certain webwops, bollin are very important now. I'm gonna hover over here
[4909.70s -> 4912.70s]  You see how fiddle is right here?
[4912.70s -> 4916.70s]  I'm actually going to just walk in here and see if I can like...
[4916.70s -> 4918.70s]  Yeah, we see him, nice.
[4918.70s -> 4922.70s]  See, this is exactly what I was talking about before.
[4922.70s -> 4924.70s]  Do you see what my support is doing?
[4924.70s -> 4927.70s]  I left the lane.
[4927.70s -> 4933.70s]  Guys, I walked to like stand next to my jungler after we push the wave in.
[4933.70s -> 4938.70s]  My Lulu is hanging out by herself, bot lane.
[4938.70s -> 4958.79s]  But he should just chill in.
[4958.79s -> 4960.79s]  You don't want to do that.
[4960.79s -> 4962.79s]  You don't want to ever want to be the guy who's like,
[4962.79s -> 4965.79s]  buy yourself bot lane as a support.
[4965.79s -> 4968.79s]  Because you don't, like,
[4968.79s -> 4970.79s]  supports don't need gold, right?
[4970.79s -> 4971.79s]  Not really.
[4971.79s -> 4972.79s]  And you don't need farm.
[4972.79s -> 4973.79s]  You don't need all that shit.
[4973.79s -> 4974.79s]  So if you're 80 carry rooms,
[4974.79s -> 4976.79s]  and unless the wave is fucked and they're just being stupid,
[4976.79s -> 4978.79s]  you have to fix the wave or something,
[4978.79s -> 4980.79s]  you don't want to be buy yourself in the lane.
[4980.79s -> 4985.55s]  It just doesn't do anything.
[4985.55s -> 4994.79s]  How do I not auto tower? Oh, I used to tell that. So there's a way there's actually a setting you can have in the game where when you hit a button
[4994.79s -> 5004.39s]  And makes it so that I can't physically hit anything but a champion. It's target. It's called target champions only and it's basically like here
[5004.39s -> 5007.95s]  I'll do it for you right now. Watch. You see how like I can hit the tower. You see how it's the red
[5008.75s -> 5010.75s]  sword
[5011.15s -> 5014.75s]  So when I hit this button, I can no longer hit the tower or the minions
[5015.55s -> 5019.07s]  But I can still hit the champions.
[5019.07s -> 5024.19s]  So essentially when you're fighting in a big minion wave or you're fighting under
[5024.19s -> 5028.79s]  turret and you don't want to miss click, you just hit target champions only
[5028.79s -> 5033.31s]  button and it makes it a thousand times easier because you can literally only hit
[5033.31s -> 5049.15s]  the champion. It's really nice. And you can make the button anything you want
[5049.15s -> 5058.52s]  obviously. I just I used Tilda, that's the default. I actually want to kill
[5058.52s -> 5063.64s]  these guys but I need to wait for the way to push out just to care. The jungler could be
[5063.64s -> 5066.76s]  bought but it is a fetal stick so it's like I don't really care about a fetal stick being bought.
[5067.32s -> 5088.44s]  We can straight up just kill them. Okay well apparently we can't kill them because apparently
[5088.44s -> 5095.96s]  my rule we didn't want to walk up. That's so frustrating man. I did fuck up my uh my auto there
[5095.96s -> 5102.04s]  but I am a little I am kind of curious what happens. I don't have to go watch the vod. I fucked up my
[5102.04s -> 5107.64s]  kill in the Ziya, I think I walked to left and to her dapp. My movement was bad. Like essentially
[5107.64s -> 5113.00s]  when they fight, right? I walked like this, I should have walked like this because you want to cut
[5113.00s -> 5118.60s]  off the Ziya from the gank. Now I do think when we just blindly ran away, I think she kind of
[5118.60s -> 5123.00s]  griefed. You don't need to insta run from ganks, especially when like you could see what I have,
[5123.00s -> 5128.28s]  right? Like I have Durk and Sheen. Something that a lot of people do as well is they will see
[5128.28s -> 5134.04s]  that like the numbers are uneven and they'll instantly run away. They don't think about like how to win the fight or like what the the win
[5134.04s -> 5138.12s]  Conn is of the fight because that's why I was saying before we got gang to write I was like fiddle can't can't can't
[5138.12s -> 5141.96s]  And he can't pre-sex fiddle does nothing in the gang. I had cleanse
[5142.92s -> 5148.68s]  They don't actually beat us in 3v2, so the problem was is we weren't focusing the same target
[5148.68s -> 5151.16s]  I went for the Ziya and she backed really far up
[5151.80s -> 5157.40s]  Now if we had played forward a bit like say she played a little more forward with me that would have gone a lot better
[5157.40s -> 5162.78s]  Or if I had played a little more back with her it was basically like we don't have comms so the you know, I got rough
[5164.98s -> 5168.46s]  Now, Fiddler is six now, so it's a little scary
[5169.26s -> 5173.42s]  I don't like playing versus fiddle sticks for like the reason of like 90% of the time
[5174.42s -> 5178.14s]  Players don't know how to ward around fiddle people put words and weird spots
[5178.78s -> 5194.60s]  We should have won that fight though. I'm a little salty mainly myself so this too. We will keep speeding me up
[5197.80s -> 5203.97s]  I want to be honest with you, I don't like when we lose do that.
[5203.97s -> 5206.77s]  It's like a pet pee thing of mine, when we lose use their speed.
[5206.77s -> 5211.65s]  I'm okay with it if I need to dog something or I need to chase somebody, but I think
[5211.65s -> 5215.61s]  it's just so much less value than using it to CC, early game.
[5215.61s -> 5221.33s]  Early game, the CC of we will like using W is so broken to me because they just physically
[5221.33s -> 5232.00s]  can't move their character for like 1.5 seconds, which is crazy.
[5232.00s -> 5234.84s]  I think Fiddles bought.
[5234.84s -> 5241.38s]  You can kind of tell, you see how they're playing really aggressive?
[5241.38s -> 5247.26s]  They don't beat us to V2, so I'm thinking and they just cleared this word out.
[5247.26s -> 5253.64s]  I'm thinking Fiddler is either on Dragon or he's bush ganking bot somewhere, so I don't
[5253.64s -> 5258.14s]  really want to walk up.
[5258.14s -> 5260.54s]  You see how this guy is confidently hitting the turret?
[5260.54s -> 5269.88s]  This is making me think Fiddler's trying to win Gank, because they cannot beat us to V2.
[5269.88s -> 5274.94s]  Like I think Fiddler's in here, so I'm actually just going to play thing.
[5274.94s -> 5290.55s]  And don't we see him on the map? I don't know I'm not going to take the chance because
[5290.55s -> 5296.55s]  you got to think about like what you see and what you don't see on the map. Like we can't physically see fit alright
[5296.55s -> 5303.55s]  But think about this. We don't see him top. That's something you have to think about. We had a ward on Rift just now for 15
[5303.55s -> 5314.76s]  15 seconds, right? We didn't see him top. So like if he's not top, where is he? Now I think he finally left.
[5314.76s -> 5333.84s]  This looks like he went to Dragon. Yeah. What are we doing by the way? I mean, I guess I'm just going to die.
[5334.34s -> 5337.84s]  Now would be the time to speed me.
[5338.34s -> 5340.84s]  I mean, I don't even know what to say about that.
[5340.84s -> 5342.84s]  Malzahar just didn't walk.
[5342.84s -> 5350.26s]  Gragas didn't flash his E. Malzahar didn't walk.
[5351.76s -> 5354.76s]  You always walk there by the way. I want to make this clear.
[5354.76s -> 5358.76s]  If you're a mid-liner and you're playing a late game scaling mid,
[5358.76s -> 5363.88s]  You always walk to the fight no matter what though if it's at if it's going if it's doing that
[5365.40s -> 5367.40s]  Okay, guys
[5367.88s -> 5371.96s]  We need to walk to fights and Lulu you need to
[5372.44s -> 5380.16s]  Follow up when I go in don't run. I'm just gonna type it because I'm actually fucking annoying
[5382.03s -> 5386.79s]  My little frustrated. I still think the game is 100% one of old, but I'm playing Draven
[5386.79s -> 5389.79s]  We're playing like I'm playing fucking Ezreal or some shit
[5389.79s -> 5395.43s]  And I can't walk up because essentially we know Fiddle was bought for the last two three minutes, right?
[5395.43s -> 5407.37s]  He just sat down there. What is my loop loop doing? Bro, what are you doing?
[5408.01s -> 5412.60s]  No, we fight this, go.
[5413.32s -> 5422.17s]  Yeah, this guy doesn't get to do this for free. Now they have a gale force, so I need to be a little care.
[5423.13s -> 5425.13s]  This guy has no ulti though.
[5425.13s -> 5432.96s]  But this is what I'm losing my mind, man. I do just
[5432.96s -> 5444.74s]  follow. No, what she was doing was she was trying to protect her ward. She saw the
[5444.74s -> 5449.82s]  recon heading the ward, but the Ziya walked up to get a free to just die. The problem
[5449.82s -> 5453.50s]  is my Louis Louis was like, oh, I don't want to give up my ward, and she wasn't thinking.
[5453.50s -> 5462.02s]  Please just sit with me. Okay.
[5462.02s -> 5469.02s]  I need you to follow me always.
[5469.02s -> 5475.02s]  Even if it looks scary, you gotta follow, okay?
[5475.02s -> 5489.37s]  Also, one thing is there's actually not a lot of fighting that happens in lower ego.
[5489.37s -> 5497.37s]  So a lot of these players don't know how to fight early, because one thing that I think has gotten really bad about me lately
[5497.37s -> 5502.65s]  Just in the past few years, is people don't ever limit test and wig ever anymore?
[5502.65s -> 5505.29s]  They always just play like Pussies.
[5505.29s -> 5508.65s]  Every single player in wig plays like a fucking pussy, not as.
[5508.65s -> 5511.97s]  And it's literally just like sad to see.
[5511.97s -> 5521.88s]  Like right there, why aren't we W-ing?
[5521.88s -> 5527.92s]  Use W on the Ziya, not to speed.
[5527.92s -> 5533.03s]  Like, I'm losing my mind.
[5533.03s -> 5536.71s]  Because all you have to do there is W this I actually get C seed we kill her on the W.
[5538.15s -> 5545.27s]  I'm telling you, blue blue players are like hard wired for some reason to not play correctly.
[5561.92s -> 5564.56s]  I'm never gonna catch this guy. He's got Gail forcing to your two boots.
[5570.79s -> 5574.31s]  Yeah, I mean, I have to go forward though because if I don't go for Gail, it's now the game's over.
[5574.87s -> 5578.63s]  So it's either we go forward or we lose. So I'm willing to like look stupid.
[5582.02s -> 5586.74s]  Honestly, this game was my fault for the one to be three that happened early. I misplied it.
[5587.06s -> 5590.56s]  And if I didn't misplay that, we would have won the game off it.
[5590.56s -> 5593.16s]  Now the game's pretty much over.
[5593.16s -> 5595.36s]  Like, it's so low queue, so we can always come back.
[5595.36s -> 5600.56s]  But the problem is, I don't think we have good enough players to come back.
[5600.56s -> 5603.36s]  Like, look at what Lou was doing, Lou Lou.
[5603.36s -> 5605.16s]  Why are you bought so low?
[5605.16s -> 5609.31s]  At the moment, think.
[5609.31s -> 5610.11s]  Like, what?
[5610.11s -> 5621.98s]  He's, ah, ah, what are we doing?
[5621.98s -> 5623.98s]  This is exactly what I was telling you guys.
[5623.98s -> 5625.58s]  It doesn't make sense.
[5625.58s -> 5629.82s]  Remember when I told you supports easy, all you have to do is be a human.
[5629.82s -> 5633.34s]  Remember when I said that 40 sec or four minutes ago before the game started?
[5636.04s -> 5640.28s]  All you have to do to play support is think, push buttons, and be active in the game.
[5640.28s -> 5642.60s]  And if you can do those things, you'll get chavinger on support.
[5646.55s -> 5651.19s]  Like it blows my mind. Look at what you're doing!
[5671.29s -> 5673.93s]  This is a forfe, though. I'm gonna lose my mind.
[5676.39s -> 5677.91s]  Auto filled AD.
[5682.73s -> 5683.37s]  I'm gonna lose it.
[5683.37s -> 5705.08s]  it. My bad, guess. I'm an auto-filled AD. I'm just bad. It's on me. I apologize. Oh, man.
[5705.08s -> 5711.75s]  These players are crazy. I'm actually really surprised. We're just not for
[5711.75s -> 5718.52s]  fitting now. The best way to play the game is something that like I fall back
[5718.52s -> 5721.96s]  them to to where I fuck this up sometimes, right? But the best way to play the game
[5721.96s -> 5729.60s]  a lot of the time is you essentially don't play to take risks. I know it sounds silly
[5729.60s -> 5732.32s]  Because you got to find essentially you have to find the
[5737.54s -> 5743.42s]  My mouse a hard just let up let this guy this 1,000 gold walk away. Hey mouse
[5744.38s -> 5747.94s]  If you moved by the way, you get one k gold
[5755.76s -> 5765.62s]  Mid isn't hard roll. I can mid in my sleep. It's not
[5766.54s -> 5780.54s]  It is easiest roll. I'm 80 carries streamer. I play AD but Lulu is
[5780.54s -> 5789.48s]  is a small brain.
[5789.48s -> 5790.48s]  That was mean.
[5790.48s -> 5792.56s]  Lulu took some crossfire there
[5792.56s -> 5793.56s]  that she didn't need to take.
[5793.56s -> 5796.62s]  That was my bad.
[5796.62s -> 5815.66s]  That was toxic.
[5815.66s -> 5816.34s]  I'll be real.
[5816.34s -> 5819.22s]  I think today is gonna be a mute all kind of day.
[5819.22s -> 5822.74s]  Listening to low elo players talk about the game
[5822.74s -> 5824.54s]  and then they think that they're right about the game
[5824.54s -> 5826.18s]  and like how it works and all the shits.
[5826.18s -> 5827.54s]  It actually like hurts me.
[5827.54s -> 5828.90s]  Like it shouldn't.
[5828.90s -> 5831.18s]  I should just laugh it off but sometimes
[5831.18s -> 5833.26s]  when I see a low elo player talk about how they think
[5833.26s -> 5834.54s]  the game should be played
[5834.54s -> 5836.42s]  And I just know that they're wrong.
[5836.42s -> 5842.05s]  It actually like physically hurts me.
[5842.05s -> 5842.89s]  It does.
[5842.89s -> 5853.62s]  It physically hurts.
[5853.62s -> 5855.50s]  But I should follow my own rule
[5855.50s -> 5857.74s]  where if you're playing with people
[5857.74s -> 5860.98s]  that aren't as good like they don't see what you see.
[5860.98s -> 5861.82s]  Right?
[5861.82s -> 5865.10s]  There's like something where it's better to play safe in scale,
[5865.10s -> 5866.38s]  even on driving.
[5866.38s -> 5867.62s]  It's better to play safe in scale
[5867.62s -> 5869.66s]  than to go for plays in lane.
[5873.10s -> 5874.58s]  Mainly because
[5874.58s -> 5881.70s]  If you go for plays in lane and let's say your support is not as good as you, or your
[5881.70s -> 5884.82s]  support is not confident in their ability to TV too, right?
[5884.82s -> 5886.06s]  Then you're just going to lose.
[5886.06s -> 5889.90s]  So you're like forcing that person to be in an uncomfortable situation.
[5889.90s -> 5896.10s]  So it's hard for me as a player to just play safe when I see the enemy making mistake
[5896.10s -> 5897.10s]  after mistake.
[5897.10s -> 5901.34s]  It's like something that I have trouble, like personally working on, right?
[5901.34s -> 5905.90s]  is like a personal issue where like I'll see an enemy make a mistake, positional wise
[5905.90s -> 5909.38s]  and I'm like oh shit let's abuse this. But a lot of the time the problem that happens
[5909.38s -> 5913.78s]  is you have somebody who doesn't know that that person made a mistake or doesn't see
[5913.78s -> 5917.74s]  the same mistake as me. And because there's no comms I can't relate to them that we should
[5917.74s -> 5922.22s]  fight, right? So if I go in and they don't know that we should be fighting there, I end
[5922.22s -> 5930.86s]  of dying and it looks it feels really bad, which is I mean my fault it's like a personal
[5930.86s -> 5935.62s]  thing because you can't control your supports, you can only control yourself. It's just
[5935.62s -> 5964.46s]  something that like I suck at doing sometimes. Right? So that's just on man. We could
[5964.46s -> 5994.41s]  actually kill the Zyron, by the way. She's like 60% HP. Like we could kill her. What
[5994.41s -> 6011.80s]  is my braggest doing? Oh, he got her though, nice. Bro, use W. Just see people. Not to
[6011.80s -> 6029.90s]  speed people. That was a good example, too. Oh, well, I just got to get better doing that where I play safe though. That's on me
[6030.50s -> 6063.34s]  That's just a personal thing. I got to get better out. Oh, bad. I think we're warmed up though. What 80 carry you guys want to see next game?
[6064.54s -> 6069.62s]  That was that was a brutal ask game. I'm gonna be real. That was a brutal ask game
[6071.06s -> 6074.42s]  180 carry streamer. You guys want to see or 80 kick stream. What 80 carry?
[6074.42s -> 6083.96s]  champion. Do you guys want to see this game? I just goofed up and tried to play
[6083.96s -> 6087.16s]  to aggressive with the player that wasn't going to play aggressive. That was on me.
[6087.16s -> 6120.56s]  That's my bad. All the, I'll play better. Sky, this guy goes sion. Never change to
[6120.56s -> 6143.47s]  it's shit, never change. Well, the thing is, you have, I have to change my mindset.
[6143.47s -> 6145.69s]  So like the thing, okay, let me explain something
[6145.69s -> 6147.61s]  just like a personal thing with me.
[6147.61s -> 6150.33s]  I'm very, very, very good mechanically at this game, right?
[6150.33s -> 6153.45s]  Like, it's my best trade is like I have very good mechanics.
[6153.45s -> 6157.05s]  So, and I also have like an autistic weird brain
[6157.05s -> 6162.05s]  where I can see, I have really good pattern recognition.
[6162.25s -> 6165.09s]  So when I see that the enemy is fucking up,
[6165.09s -> 6167.73s]  I know that I'm pretty much always gonna be better
[6167.73s -> 6170.69s]  at the TV2, okay?
[6170.69s -> 6174.41s]  So, because I know that I'm always gonna be better
[6174.41s -> 6178.65s]  at the TV2, I always wanna take the fight
[6179.93s -> 6181.41s]  when I see that they make a mistake,
[6181.41s -> 6183.05s]  like they miss a skill shot,
[6183.05s -> 6186.21s]  or they walk up too far, stuff like that, right?
[6186.21s -> 6188.17s]  But the problem is, when you're bowling,
[6188.17s -> 6190.17s]  you have to work with a teammate,
[6190.17s -> 6192.29s]  and that's part of just playing AD carry, right?
[6192.29s -> 6194.53s]  And if you're in so much, you can't always do them.
[6194.53s -> 6198.29s]  So, I have to train myself
[6198.29s -> 6204.29s]  to just be okay with them making mistakes and us not abusing those mistakes.
[6204.29s -> 6208.29s]  It's very frustrating for me personally because I'm a perfectionist.
[6208.29s -> 6212.29s]  So it's very frustrating for me to like see this happening and I'm like, oh, I want to abuse this because I know we can.
[6212.29s -> 6219.29s]  But we have to like, I have to like tell myself not to and just like not fuck up the way of state not take bad trades and shit.
[6219.29s -> 6225.29s]  Because every there's there's more to it too. So if like I walk up and I take a fight, right? Let's say like when we're con W.
[6225.29s -> 6231.77s]  in when the fiddle game. For example, right? If I take that fight, I'm now banking that
[6231.77s -> 6236.49s]  fight on Lulu also playing correctly, right? Like they missed all their abilities and they
[6236.49s -> 6244.57s]  fucked up, but I also messed like, you, nobody can play perfectly every game. Like I can't
[6244.57s -> 6248.81s]  teammates can't, nobody can't. It's legal. We're all humans, right? So you have to bank when you're
[6248.81s -> 6253.13s]  doing that on like your teammate being able to know what you want to accomplish in that moment
[6253.13s -> 6259.01s]  And so I'll queue with no comms and it's really hard like it's it's a really bad mindset that I have sometimes
[6259.89s -> 6261.89s]  But it's hard to get over because like I
[6263.21s -> 6271.55s]  Like the waning phase for me is the most fun part of the game. I love waning phase because in my opinion
[6271.55s -> 6274.47s]  Laning phase is like a little mini chess game between the enemy ball in right
[6275.47s -> 6282.51s]  It's like a it's like a chess game with like mechanics where it's like how how well can like I auto space them right
[6282.51s -> 6290.27s]  can I space them well? Can I space them like can I by spacing? I mean can I walk into them trade and not take damage back, right?
[6290.59s -> 6294.87s]  And I'm always thinking to myself, okay, can I do that? I can and then I'm like, I want to do this, right?
[6294.87s -> 6299.23s]  And then I'll like get somebody to half and then they'll panic and they'll engage on me and
[6299.55s -> 6306.19s]  the problem is though is like I said without comms or without like people who are recognizing what you're trying to accomplish
[6306.87s -> 6308.35s]  sometimes
[6308.35s -> 6318.15s]  Supports and junglers people get flustered and it will go badly and it's my fault at the end of the day because I'm choosing to that play style of relying on my teammates
[6318.51s -> 6324.55s]  Instead of like knowing that I can probably outscale and play better away game and just like keep good CS and not die on shit
[6324.79s -> 6330.59s]  Which is what you guys should all do and that's what I tell people to do when they ask me how to play
[6330.59s -> 6338.15s]  I tell you, don't die, scale up, get items, but like, because I've played the game for so long and my favorite part of the game is
[6340.03s -> 6344.95s]  Lane phase and like winning lane and playing that little chess game. I fucked myself over in a lot of games
[6345.67s -> 6351.79s]  because I'll like, you know, force fights that like my teammate would have to play well in as well to win and
[6352.55s -> 6357.91s]  I'll make a mistake or I'll make a mistake and we'll just lose the game off it and it's not a good play style
[6357.91s -> 6362.55s]  Well, right, it's not a good poistal.
[6362.55s -> 6364.23s]  But that's just like something that like,
[6364.23s -> 6367.31s]  I know other people probably also have.
[6367.31s -> 6368.95s]  And I'm telling you that like, if you want to climb,
[6368.95s -> 6370.47s]  you got to get out of that mindset
[6370.47s -> 6376.53s]  and get into the mindset of like, consistency.
[6376.53s -> 6379.05s]  Because you can see last game, for example,
[6379.05s -> 6383.05s]  I just straight up like, lost the game off of me,
[6384.17s -> 6386.73s]  trying to fight when my support didn't know how to fight
[6386.73s -> 6392.03s]  or want to fight, and we lost the game off it.
[6392.03s -> 6396.99s]  Like I was too aggro and even though if they did play correctly we win they didn't so we lost
[6396.99s -> 6399.55s]  So it's basically like it's just not like a good
[6400.75s -> 6402.75s]  It's not a good
[6402.75s -> 6404.75s]  What's the word I'm looking for
[6405.15s -> 6413.84s]  Strategy because last game was my fault
[6414.88s -> 6421.68s]  Because I'm good enough at the game that I know that I can't play like that if I want to be consistent and I still point like it
[6421.68s -> 6430.84s]  So it's my ban. I want to be playing this game boys. We got Rengar karma gin
[6430.84s -> 6433.08s]  What do people want to see?
[6433.08s -> 6437.48s]  Let me see if any of the 80 characters people want to see if I can play these.
[6437.48s -> 6439.20s]  I can't play Vain into this.
[6439.20s -> 6440.84s]  Vain would be way too hard in the carnivore gym.
[6440.84s -> 6451.14s]  I would just get it down to the wave.
[6451.14s -> 6453.54s]  I can play a phallios.
[6453.54s -> 6459.74s]  This is actually a good of phallios game.
[6459.74s -> 6461.34s]  You know what kind of sucks?
[6461.34s -> 6466.54s]  I feel kind of bad playing a phallios when I'm on my teaching account.
[6466.54s -> 6468.46s]  Like this account I like teach you guys.
[6468.46s -> 6474.66s]  I feel bad to playing a fellow sometimes, because I know a lot of people don't want to
[6474.66s -> 6483.58s]  learn a fellow or play a fellow else, because he is like really, he's very unique, like
[6483.58s -> 6488.10s]  he's he's hard to learn for a lot of people. So I feel I always feel kind of bad doing
[6488.10s -> 6497.42s]  it, right? But I'll be real. I don't know in this specific situation outside of like jinx,
[6497.42s -> 6499.02s]  I didn't really know what else to pick.
[6500.38s -> 6501.38s]  Like, jinx is good.
[6501.38s -> 6502.86s]  Kaisas probably okay,
[6502.86s -> 6512.20s]  but you still get zoned off the way, Iv'n Kaisa.
[6512.20s -> 6513.92s]  Cause like, if we look at this, right?
[6517.67s -> 6520.79s]  Kaisa would've been, I guess, okay.
[6520.79s -> 6523.35s]  But when you're picking a champion for bot lane, right?
[6524.39s -> 6526.39s]  When you're picking a champion for bot lane,
[6526.39s -> 6527.95s]  one thing that you guys should think about
[6527.95s -> 6530.19s]  when picking what champion you want to play.
[6530.19s -> 6532.39s]  Unless you're a one trick and then play whatever you want.
[6532.39s -> 6533.91s]  But if you're like somebody who wants to actually
[6533.91s -> 6541.16s]  like, play the meta and learn why champions are meta and when to pick what?
[6541.16s -> 6542.64s]  They picked Jin Karma.
[6542.64s -> 6545.28s]  Now, we have a Lulu.
[6545.28s -> 6550.80s]  If we had something with a hook, like a not-a-less, a blitz, a thrash, a pike, like if we had
[6550.80s -> 6554.24s]  something like that, I could pick a low range fighter, right?
[6554.24s -> 6558.24s]  Like, I could pick a low range fighter if we had a hook champ.
[6558.24s -> 6562.68s]  But because we don't have a hook champ and we have an enchanter, I have to pick something
[6562.68s -> 6567.68s]  that can safely consistently farm and not get zoned off by their bow in.
[6567.68s -> 6570.48s]  So there's not a lot of options that can do that.
[6570.48s -> 6573.68s]  There's like, I didn't want to put a you could pick Ezreal here.
[6573.68s -> 6575.18s]  It's not the worst, but we had a loose.
[6575.18s -> 6578.08s]  So I didn't want to pick Ezreal because we lose goes the waste.
[6578.08s -> 6580.78s]  So it's like you could pick jinx, but I kind of didn't want to pick jinx the same
[6580.78s -> 6583.28s]  because jinx borst is shen out of me right now.
[6583.28s -> 6586.48s]  So this would be a good jinx game though.
[6586.48s -> 6589.28s]  If you guys are curious, like this would be a completely fine jinx game.
[6589.28s -> 6593.60s]  Your E stops Rangar Jump.
[6593.60s -> 6596.64s]  You can follow up really easily with Lulu like this would be a good jinx game
[6599.68s -> 6603.76s]  But a failure. It's a good a failure game too. It's both it's gonna fail his game good jinx game
[6604.80s -> 6606.80s]  It could be a good zerry game
[6607.04s -> 6612.08s]  Zerry wouldn't be that bad here with Lulu and against their comp. They're all really squishy
[6612.56s -> 6615.52s]  She's really mobile can get away from like ringer ganks pretty easily
[6616.48s -> 6619.52s]  Tristana I okay, so Trist is unique because
[6619.52s -> 6622.72s]  because you only picked Tristana
[6622.72s -> 6624.64s]  if you plan on winning land.
[6624.64s -> 6625.92s]  Okay.
[6625.92s -> 6629.68s]  Tristana doesn't actually scale better than Jinks
[6629.68s -> 6630.52s]  in any way.
[6632.16s -> 6634.92s]  Like, she does not have a better scaling than Jinks.
[6634.92s -> 6637.16s]  Trist, Trist, verse, Jinks, three items.
[6637.16s -> 6640.84s]  Jinks wins every time and team fights no matter what.
[6640.84s -> 6643.12s]  Like, she just does what Trist does better.
[6645.28s -> 6647.20s]  Now, the reason you picked Trist is because you do want
[6647.20s -> 6648.04s]  to win land.
[6648.04s -> 6651.72s]  jump in, you want to kill them, you want to be aggressive, right? So that's what you're picking
[6651.72s -> 6656.28s]  trust for, is that I get kills in Wayne. The problem is, is again, what we were just talking
[6656.28s -> 6662.28s]  about, right? Let's say I pick trust to get kills in Wayne. Now let's say my, my support doesn't
[6662.28s -> 6665.96s]  want to be aggressive, and let's say like the Jane in the karma have a really good push.
[6666.52s -> 6671.96s]  Okay? Something that trust is really weak at is being pushed in, right? That's one of our
[6671.96s -> 6676.28s]  weakest things, but she has, she struggles, especially early game. She struggles quite a bit on
[6676.28s -> 6682.96s]  farming under turn. So let's say it's just like a coin-flippy pick. You could
[6682.96s -> 6688.60s]  pick trust if you add a like a support duo for sure. Indigent. Trust is
[6688.60s -> 6693.28s]  amazing Indigent. It's one of Jen's hardest actual counters. But again, it's
[6693.28s -> 6695.88s]  not about countering the champion. It's about countering the lane and what
[6695.88s -> 6700.04s]  the lane is going to do to you and being able to play around that. And this
[6700.04s -> 6704.16s]  lane is a shove lane. Jen Karma doesn't fight you. They poke you and shove
[6704.16s -> 6708.48s]  That's what they do. They're a prior win. So they're just going to shove and shove, right?
[6708.84s -> 6715.96s]  So because they're just going to shove and shove and shove, I need to play something that isn't going to have issues playing under turret or something that can shove back if I need to
[6717.08s -> 6726.54s]  Right, which is why jinks a fellow. I also both good as real again would just get shoved in stuff like that right
[6726.54s -> 6730.10s]  These are things you actually have to think about when you're playing the game for certain
[6730.94s -> 6732.30s]  Champions
[6732.30s -> 6734.86s]  It's certain matchups because a lot of the time
[6735.38s -> 6739.98s]  People will pick a champion that's meta and they won't understand why they're still losing the matchup
[6739.98s -> 6745.58s]  Even though they're good at that champion and it's just that you're not bad at the champ the matchup is just unplayable
[6745.98s -> 6747.98s]  You could put faker
[6748.22s -> 6749.18s]  Double-lift
[6749.18s -> 6755.86s]  Fucking gloomy Aussie in certain matchups and they will just lose. They will lose the matchups and it's because no matter how good your mechanics are
[6756.46s -> 6759.10s]  If the matchup is played correctly, it doesn't it's not win-able
[6759.10s -> 6765.30s]  And that's why you see him pro play drafting is so important. It's perfect example of why it in pro play
[6765.68s -> 6770.82s]  Drafting is 10 times more important than solo queue and it's because when everybody plays the matchups correctly in shit, right?
[6772.75s -> 6774.75s]  When everybody's playing the matchups correctly in shit
[6775.79s -> 6779.19s]  The matchup like skill becomes a thousand times more important
[6780.41s -> 6785.05s]  Or like you know how the matchups being play like the champions become way more important
[6785.69s -> 6787.69s]  Whoa, what the fuck
[6787.69s -> 6796.37s]  I'm on there just fuck up. What the hell is going on? Another little tip for you guys.
[6796.37s -> 6812.80s]  Ooh, I fuck that. But another little tip for you guys is melee champions, or melee minions take one turret shot, two autos,
[6812.80s -> 6818.17s]  or sorry, two turret shots, one autos, and casters take one autot, one turret shot.
[6818.17s -> 6822.17s]  When you're under turrets, like luck. Okay, so.
[6822.17s -> 6827.17s]  This would be actually a pretty game to explain to you how to farm out of the turret, actually.
[6827.17s -> 6830.79s]  I was thinking about like what I could teach you guys because we're just getting a shove didn't a lot this game
[6832.55s -> 6842.66s]  It's actually not that bad though. So right now we could actually space forward here
[6843.86s -> 6859.09s]  Okay, that did not hit me that was BS but sure. I did the same thing. I did last game man
[6860.45s -> 6862.85s]  I did the same thing you said I walked up
[6863.93s -> 6867.03s]  It wasn't it was a good fight, but again I
[6867.57s -> 6872.17s]  Keep doing that we're like I see the fight and I'll take the fight because I know it's a good fight
[6872.21s -> 6882.09s]  but Lulu was too far back so I ended up just inting. It's really stupid. I got
[6882.09s -> 6901.40s]  such a dumb play by me because I had to pull up both my sums right there because the
[6901.40s -> 6904.44s]  Jin or I mean the Jin was in a really bad spot and the car moves in a really
[6904.44s -> 6907.28s]  bad spot because I was level 3 and they were level 2 and they were walking up to
[6907.28s -> 6913.68s]  contest waves. But my Lulu was behind me and when you're playing you know so
[6913.68s -> 6918.12s]  will you you have to play as a team with your team mate. Okay so this
[6918.12s -> 6926.16s]  This gen is kind of griefing right now.
[6926.16s -> 6929.28s]  He's griefing by walking up when I'm blue gunning him.
[6929.28s -> 6936.04s]  I don't know what blue is doing.
[6936.04s -> 6937.44s]  I'm just killing that guy nice.
[6937.44s -> 6941.84s]  They're griefing really hard, so the blue gun is OP for what you just saw.
[6941.84s -> 6945.32s]  All you have to do with the blue gun if you really want to just have a funny ass overpowered
[6945.32s -> 6947.48s]  fucking...
[6947.48s -> 6950.84s]  With their farming under the turret like that, just hit the minions.
[6950.84s -> 6960.93s]  Okay, we're getting ganked.
[6960.93s -> 6966.92s]  Back up.
[6966.92s -> 6972.92s]  So I kind of did a cardinal send there, I would say, like a send of like, I overstate a bit.
[6972.92s -> 6973.92s]  I think.
[6973.92s -> 6977.92s]  Oh, okay, we'll fuck off.
[6977.92s -> 6979.92s]  That was greedy.
[6979.92s -> 6982.92s]  I should have backed that the turret, but I didn't think karma was actually new to that, but,
[6982.92s -> 6986.92s]  I did overstate because you can see like this is the perfect example of why I overstate.
[6986.92s -> 6988.92s]  So they stopped my back, right?
[6988.92s -> 6991.92s]  I can give you guys a really good example of what just happens.
[6991.92s -> 6995.92s]  I overstate, and when I overstate, I didn't actually get anything out of it.
[6995.92s -> 7000.56s]  out of it. Like I got what you saw I just have extra gold for nothing. So now I just
[7000.56s -> 7004.96s]  have extra gold, right? And because I have extra gold, the gin actually gets in that positive
[7004.96s -> 7009.44s]  because they stopped my back. So he gets a free plate here. I miss a cannon and even though
[7009.44s -> 7014.80s]  I'm still up 10 CS, it's like I could have been up 10 CS, not given a plate and not
[7015.52s -> 7023.72s]  missed a cannon. So it's it's basically like it's interesting. Should you get prior for your
[7023.72s -> 7024.76s]  for your jungle or a game?
[7024.76s -> 7025.76s]  No.
[7025.76s -> 7029.78s]  No, that's not important.
[7029.78s -> 7032.30s]  Some games, prior is important.
[7032.30s -> 7033.98s]  It's very important, some games.
[7033.98s -> 7035.94s]  But you don't need to always be thinking about getting
[7035.94s -> 7037.94s]  prior for your jungle.
[7037.94s -> 7039.62s]  That's not something you should be like thinking about,
[7039.62s -> 7040.62s]  like always, right?
[7040.62s -> 7043.42s]  Like, you think about it in terms of like, timers.
[7043.42s -> 7045.42s]  That's important, but prior for jungle or always
[7045.42s -> 7054.72s]  is not like something you should be worrying about.
[7054.72s -> 7056.44s]  Because if you're per machoving and you're like,
[7056.44s -> 7057.88s]  oh, I have prior for my jungler,
[7057.88s -> 7060.08s]  but then your jungle or doesn't do anything.
[7060.08s -> 7068.13s]  like having that pride if you don't have pride it doesn't do anything like I'd rather hold the wave and like a certain spot
[7069.73s -> 7107.52s]  oh my god i suck i mean it worked out i think if i was six i triple kill them there but
[7109.12s -> 7114.00s]  i think we actually oh i think we actually triple kill them too if we help to me but again
[7115.04s -> 7161.94s]  you guys know what i'm gonna say i go back to the thing i don't know for anger has ulterior not
[7161.94s -> 7176.05s]  I want to shove this because, uh, chill.
[7176.05s -> 7186.55s]  I want to shove it in for seconds, and I really don't have anything to do, so I'll just stand here.
[7186.55s -> 7191.55s]  You want to also be back, back, uh, once it's hit for one day by boots.
[7191.55s -> 7195.55s]  I bought boots, I felt like I was using by boots running early. He's like, he's a champion where
[7195.55s -> 7200.55s]  the more attacks you do is actually very valuable, and positioning on a failure is very important.
[7200.55s -> 7206.55s]  It's kind of like, um, some 80 carries, like, you don't need boots really early, like, like, with, like,
[7206.55s -> 7209.55s]  Like jinx for example, I usually go free boots, right?
[7209.55s -> 7213.55s]  Or I go boots like after my Kraken, but with a failure.
[7214.55s -> 7219.55s]  I really like the early mobility, the early trading, stuff like that.
[7219.55s -> 7226.87s]  Okay, so always be watching the map too.
[7226.87s -> 7228.87s]  We see the Rangar's top, right?
[7228.87s -> 7231.87s]  We can actually just straight fight these guys to be too right now.
[7231.87s -> 7233.87s]  Uh, what?
[7233.87s -> 7242.37s]  Wait, what? What's my lovelie doing?
[7242.37s -> 7243.73s]  Homey?
[7243.73s -> 7244.37s]  What?
[7244.37s -> 7255.75s]  What are we- he's opening us!
[7257.03s -> 7268.92s]  So you're saying, helping the 80 carriers back, got it.
[7268.92s -> 7272.68s]  I can't believe my blue blue just walked away from me,
[7272.68s -> 7277.24s]  and just like, watched, like, you work as a team.
[7277.24s -> 7282.29s]  This is something that I cannot stress enough.
[7282.29s -> 7284.93s]  Play as a team.
[7284.93s -> 7287.01s]  When you play League of Legends,
[7287.01s -> 7289.17s]  this tells me more than anything, because this happens
[7289.17s -> 7295.65s]  even in Grandmaster, ICT mates who will be selfish and not help each other.
[7295.65s -> 7300.41s]  Just help each other, help each other, please, man.
[7300.41s -> 7309.99s]  We are a team, don't just run and leave your ADC.
[7309.99s -> 7313.79s]  Like I'm not even flaming you, but like dude, you can't do that.
[7313.79s -> 7317.79s]  You can't be upset that like, I can't dodge every spell.
[7317.79s -> 7322.19s]  Well, come to the league, I feel like something that I noticed that happens a lot.
[7322.19s -> 7327.67s]  is players will have this weirdly high expectation for everyone to play
[7327.67s -> 7334.15s]  absolutely perfect at all times and they want me to like be Goomi Asi and I'm like
[7334.15s -> 7340.67s]  dude I dodged two of the gin bullets I dodged a karma cue like you would
[7340.67s -> 7343.95s]  or like I can't dodge literally everything will slow right like that's not how it
[7343.95s -> 7387.85s]  works like dude I'm gonna lose my mind with this guy my blue blue is blaming me
[7387.85s -> 7401.02s]  It's okay. It's okay. I don't need to be upset. It's fine. The blue blue player
[7402.46s -> 7412.76s]  It's totally okay. You know sometimes people think they're right. It's just
[7413.48s -> 7416.44s]  What happens in the world?
[7417.16s -> 7445.08s]  Right, it's just it is what it is. No big deal. Sorry. I'm trying really hard to not be an asshole right now
[7445.08s -> 7449.64s]  Now, this is what we're player is making me like, making me one of like fun
[7449.64s -> 7455.00s]  bannos, you know what I mean? Like this guy is like making me like this guy, like we talk
[7455.00s -> 7461.48s]  about, like in league, we talk about like the players, like we talk about AD carry players
[7461.48s -> 7469.16s]  having ego. I genuinely think support players have five times the ego AD carry players have,
[7469.72s -> 7477.84s]  but with like a third of the skill. I think AD carry players do have massive egos,
[7478.32s -> 7486.44s]  But again, I don't think that like I'd support players or genuinely the dumbest mother-fucking
[7486.44s -> 7491.72s]  humans on the planet, and they think that they're the best players to ever touch the game.
[7491.72s -> 7493.44s]  And it hurts my fucking balls.
[7493.44s -> 7517.40s]  Hey, Lulu.
[7517.40s -> 7521.04s]  Would you be willing to have a...
[7521.04s -> 7527.24s]  ...vod review with me in this sport after the game?
[7527.24s -> 7528.24s]  Let's just see.
[7528.24s -> 7531.24s]  I want to see if like this person is willing to listen to reason.
[7531.24s -> 7533.24s]  Let's see.
[7533.24s -> 7561.33s]  I'm trying to not tell, but it's really frustrating.
[7561.33s -> 7567.07s]  Because this player is playing specifically for KDA, and they're playing like they don't
[7567.07s -> 7571.99s]  understand how, like, I can already tell you, if I go look at this person's OP.G, they
[7571.99s -> 7572.99s]  only play for KDA.
[7572.99s -> 7575.79s]  I can tell you right now, right here.
[7575.79s -> 7582.11s]  person plays only for KDA never takes any risks doesn't ever help their 80 carry ever when
[7582.11s -> 7586.99s]  they get behind doesn't ever walk up to like try and fight doesn't do any of that I can tell
[7586.99s -> 7591.15s]  you right now without even looking at their OP.G from how this person plays that they have
[7591.15s -> 7600.24s]  high KDAs but really well win rate but I don't want my entire stream to be in be bitching about
[7600.24s -> 7604.48s]  this level so we'll try and focus on how to win from this position so I'm sure you guys get
[7604.48s -> 7620.43s]  shitty supports too so we'll try and focus on how to win from the car position around yeah it
[7620.43s -> 7626.89s]  It doesn't get better. I mean, I'll be honest with you. My grandmaster supports on my main suck. Like it doesn't get better
[7627.23s -> 7631.35s]  They get better like mechanically at the game, right? Like the higher-yellow
[7631.87s -> 7636.33s]  supports get better mechanically, but they get worse. They don't get better when like
[7637.05s -> 7641.67s]  It doesn't get better. It's always like you'll either have a really good support or you have somebody who sniffs glue
[7642.03s -> 7654.13s]  I'm just dead or I'm not dead
[7654.13s -> 7679.70s]  to
[7679.70s -> 7681.80s]  uh... honestly our biggest issue here is i need to get one therster a
[7681.80s -> 7692.62s]  one ticket bt the game gets a lot easier
[7692.62s -> 7694.94s]  we could kill this guy right now
[7694.94s -> 7698.46s]  if the blue will help us may be actually straight kill these guys
[7698.46s -> 7701.72s]  because i can all see the kill myself right we have a lot of i have all to
[7701.72s -> 7702.80s]  kill myself
[7702.80s -> 7704.80s]  and i'm strong
[7704.80s -> 7709.90s]  she has a night i will i have everything we could easily
[7709.90s -> 7712.34s]  kill that that tell you right there
[7712.34s -> 7716.02s]  I mean, yeah, whatever, man.
[7716.02s -> 7721.54s]  This is what I'm talking about.
[7721.54s -> 7727.82s]  Again, are you willing to get into discord and bother with you?
[7727.82s -> 7737.02s]  Yes or no?
[7737.02s -> 7741.26s]  I mean, I have to be honest with you.
[7741.26s -> 7745.46s]  The reason this is frustrating is because as an AD carry player, you want to be able to
[7745.46s -> 7747.90s]  rely on your support, right?
[7747.90s -> 7752.00s]  You want to be able to make plays, go in, fight, and rely on your teammates, because as an
[7752.00s -> 7754.80s]  to carry player, support an AD or like a duo, right?
[7754.80s -> 7757.00s]  Like you want to play it together.
[7757.00s -> 7760.60s]  No, no man, I'm not attacking you.
[7760.60s -> 7764.60s]  I'm saying let's discord after.
[7764.60s -> 7775.90s]  You can explain your POV and I'll explain mine.
[7775.90s -> 7778.70s]  Maybe we can improve this player.
[7778.70s -> 7784.34s]  Like get them to be a better player and not ruin every game they play in.
[7784.34s -> 7792.80s]  Like that would be the goat, like that did not hit me by the way.
[7792.80s -> 7817.04s]  and I have options for you, but I don't even understand, oh, man.
[7817.04s -> 7825.17s]  This is the person's, by the way, this is the person's LP.G.
[7825.17s -> 7828.57s]  Average win rate, 50% win rate, like I said,
[7828.57s -> 7835.01s]  has really good KDA's on all his champs, but he doesn't win.
[7835.01s -> 7839.01s]  I'm telling you right now, the biggest thing in league,
[7839.01s -> 7842.01s]  the biggest thing in league of legends,
[7842.01s -> 7845.01s]  is believing that you are a good player based on KDA.
[7846.49s -> 7850.25s]  If I go look at any challenger level support player right now,
[7850.25s -> 7853.17s]  their KDAs will be like four.
[7854.57s -> 7855.57s]  Those thought I have good KDA,
[7855.57s -> 7857.37s]  but it'll be like four and three,
[7857.37s -> 7861.49s]  and it'll be on, that's your mutual.
[7861.49s -> 7864.17s]  I'm gonna be real what you write out to you.
[7864.17s -> 7866.05s]  This Lugu player,
[7866.05s -> 7868.93s]  like you could tell me that this person
[7868.93s -> 7872.85s]  Sniffed glue is a kid and their parents never told them to stop and I would believe you
[7873.73s -> 7875.89s]  I'm not even meaning like I would say that makes sense
[7877.25s -> 7880.45s]  I mean like I said I don't I don't even care. I don't care if it's a girl a guy
[7880.77s -> 7884.77s]  The e-girl thing is like that doesn't bother me, right? Like it could be a girl a guy a pigeon
[7884.77s -> 7887.41s]  They could they could fucking they could
[7888.05s -> 7892.93s]  Relate as a fucking peanut in a in a fucking plane. I don't care about that at all
[7893.33s -> 7897.99s]  You know I mean like said that shit doesn't bother me at all
[7897.99s -> 7902.91s]  like then be like I actually think it's stupid when people are like oh it's an
[7902.91s -> 7907.29s]  e-girl e-girl e-girl. I think that's dumb as shit because that argument's so
[7907.29s -> 7911.43s]  crap because like I don't give a shit if it's a guy or girl because like you
[7911.43s -> 7914.63s]  know what I mean I'm more upset at the fact that this person is delugimil than
[7914.63s -> 7931.34s]  anything that's like what's tilting me here I'm just gonna mute we'll do one
[7931.34s -> 7934.86s]  more game on this account after this game and I'm gonna mute from the start of
[7934.86s -> 7946.68s]  the game for you guys. Okay. Dude, if he didn't actually get me into the wall there, I tried to walk forward
[7946.68s -> 7951.16s]  so that I wouldn't get condemned into the wall if he didn't stun me. I kill him. That's annoying.
[7952.84s -> 7973.37s]  That was actually such a good hitbox for him. My bad. Nice. You trip down. Nice job. If you're wondering
[7973.37s -> 7977.69s]  why I'm even here, by the way, I'm actually, I'm not trolling. I'm trying to get this turret because
[7977.69s -> 7982.41s]  this gives me a lot of gold. At the moment, I'm not actually worth that much gold. There's nothing
[7982.41s -> 7985.61s]  going on in the map, there's no objective or anything like that, right? So I'm trying
[7985.61s -> 7991.01s]  to push in top waves right now so that I can get gold to try and like hyper and flight
[7991.01s -> 7994.97s]  might too item before this next dragon. Because this next dragon is going to be incredibly
[7994.97s -> 8001.21s]  important if we want any chance to win. We have to win this next dragon. And the only
[8001.21s -> 8008.09s]  way for me to do that is to either get really lucky or go get some gold in a sidewin.
[8008.09s -> 8013.65s]  just support difference ever again. It is. I want to point this out. This person is playing
[8013.65s -> 8017.81s]  this victim complex bullshit. Like you don't know what I mean, but it is. It is actually
[8017.81s -> 8018.81s]  support.
[8018.81s -> 8060.45s]  Sorry, I'm tilted. I'm playing bad this game. I need to mute these players because these
[8060.45s -> 8065.41s]  players are actually tilting me. Like I was fined with it before, but I'm actually giving
[8065.41s -> 8069.65s]  it a little irritated that's making me play bad. So I need to mute them so I don't keep
[8069.65s -> 8077.83s]  venting. Like it's affecting my gameplay and it's pissing me off. That's just my
[8077.83s -> 8092.17s]  bad. Teased what? Are you here? Tey? Yo, Tey. Message to the slurgo. I mean this
[8092.17s -> 8096.89s]  in the nicest way. I don't even want to be toxic. I genuinely want to use this
[8096.89s -> 8104.15s]  for content. Like this guy's been flaming me the whole game. Like I want to use
[8104.15s -> 8108.83s]  this for content to show you guys that it is so easy to tell people how the game
[8108.83s -> 8117.47s]  should be played so easy if you if you can communicate by talking because this guy's
[8117.47s -> 8121.35s]  been doing nothing but flaming me the entire game. This is a little right but he's
[8121.35s -> 8127.15s]  an absolute like he played the lane completely bad then he then he stopped trying
[8127.15s -> 8131.17s]  to win. Stop shielding me stop doing anything right after he played the lane
[8131.17s -> 8136.69s]  bad. Then he started playing the victim thing when I asked him to be a human and
[8136.69s -> 8139.91s]  like come over and like help me and play teamwork you get him or I didn't play
[8139.91s -> 8146.15s]  a single time, right? Like I didn't say a single negative thing to this guy in game. I said let's work as a team. He got upset.
[8150.61s -> 8156.77s]  Like I genuinely think it'd be great content if I could talk to this guy in discord and just like, oh, I'd be so good.
[8173.72s -> 8181.22s]  I'm trying to kill these people guys. That wasn't bad though. We got 800 gold.
[8181.86s -> 8187.30s]  Not the worst, but I don't know if my team can stall this. Maybe thinking like, kill this, they can stall it, but
[8187.30s -> 8194.24s]  but no, that's GG.
[8194.24s -> 8234.40s]  That was disgusting to all of you.
[8234.40s -> 8236.96s]  I'm gonna add him and he'll probably not add me,
[8236.96s -> 8241.23s]  but I might as well try.
[8241.23s -> 8252.27s]  This would be such a good warning experience.
[8252.27s -> 8253.71s]  Oh, excuse me.
[8253.71s -> 8255.43s]  Dude, I've had like bad heartburn today.
[8255.43s -> 8262.61s]  I need to take one of those heartburn pills.
[8262.61s -> 8264.45s]  What, what, what, what, man?
[8264.45s -> 8266.49s]  Just say it, it's what it out.
[8266.49s -> 8271.49s]  What about, let it out, baby.
[8271.49s -> 8275.44s]  Yo, what do we do?
[8275.44s -> 8287.73s]  let's just have a talk. Yo, let's discord. We can bother with you. Since I'm so bad,
[8290.87s -> 8315.28s]  yep, trust. You just blamed everyone, blame yourself, but you didn't play correctly at all. You
[8315.28s -> 8326.26s]  played land completely wrong. Didn't help each other. Left people to die on repeats.
[8326.26s -> 8369.70s]  Then played a victim. I genuinely want to help you. This guy screenshot it, what I just said,
[8369.70s -> 8386.74s]  and put it in the end game chat. What is happening right now? What is going on?
[8386.74s -> 8398.06s]  There is no way that this is not an NPC.
[8398.06s -> 8402.06s]  There is no way.
[8402.06s -> 8404.06s]  This is not an NPC.
[8404.06s -> 8407.06s]  There's no way.
[8407.06s -> 8409.06s]  There's no way.
[8409.06s -> 8416.96s]  It's Geronimo of a Mal.
[8416.96s -> 8417.96s]  It is me.
[8417.96s -> 8419.96s]  Yes.
[8419.96s -> 8421.96s]  Bro, just come talking discord.
[8421.96s -> 8423.96s]  I'm not even going to flame you.
[8423.96s -> 8435.39s]  What does this even mean bro?
[8435.39s -> 8451.35s]  I don't think I've seen anybody more insecure in my life bro you are so insecure it's cringe how insecure you are like
[8451.35s -> 8457.99s]  Oh, ff, go walk man on the climb to masters, but
[8459.27s -> 8469.40s]  Jesus Christ, that's sad. Oh, God. I
[8469.88s -> 8477.08s]  Dude, I don't even know what to say. Like, I'll be real. I was like, I'm not even gonna flame the guy, right? I just genuinely want to like
[8477.80s -> 8479.80s]  Improves the community
[8480.76s -> 8484.76s]  Because that was three straight supports in a row. They didn't know how to play Lulu
[8484.76s -> 8490.56s]  And I'm not even gonna flame the guy's skill. He's not a Lulu player, right? He doesn't play a Lulu. That's fine
[8490.84s -> 8497.44s]  But the issue was that I had with that guy specifically was that it's okay to be bad at the game
[8497.96s -> 8501.64s]  Right, there's nothing wrong with being bad at league everybody has bad games
[8501.92s -> 8507.96s]  But when we're playing a game together and you're saying it's winnable and you want to win the game you can't pick and choose
[8508.76s -> 8510.76s]  Who to like help win the game?
[8510.76s -> 8516.92s]  Like, if I'm sitting there bot lane, we're both being dove by gin, and you're intentionally
[8516.92s -> 8524.36s]  trying not to take damage and not die because you want to value your KDA over everything else.
[8524.36s -> 8528.64s]  So that I, you know what, hold on, let me think about this.
[8528.64s -> 8532.00s]  I think I figured this person out.
[8532.00s -> 8535.60s]  This person lives in delusion, and I think I figured this out, let me explain this.
[8535.60s -> 8540.36s]  A lot of players do this, but I think I'm figuring this out as I'm thinking about this.
[8540.36s -> 8544.92s]  So this person has really good KDAs on the profile, right?
[8544.92s -> 8546.60s]  This is like this eye catching person.
[8546.60s -> 8549.60s]  They've really really good KDAs on the profile, right?
[8549.60s -> 8555.52s]  This person doesn't ever take risks, doesn't ever do anything to try and win the game
[8555.52s -> 8561.18s]  outside of like just the existing and hitting buttons.
[8561.18s -> 8566.74s]  And what they do is they will always have good KDAs and they will sit here and never,
[8566.74s -> 8568.70s]  like I know why they're losing.
[8568.70s -> 8571.62s]  They will sit here and they will do this shit where they have good KDAs.
[8571.62s -> 8574.22s]  they don't ever die that much blah blah blah.
[8574.22s -> 8576.86s]  But what they do is they lie to themselves
[8576.86s -> 8579.54s]  and they say, look how good my KDAs are.
[8579.54s -> 8585.06s]  If I had better teammates, I'd always win.
[8585.06s -> 8589.06s]  Like, I cracked the code, actually.
[8589.06s -> 8590.90s]  That's totally what it is.
[8590.90s -> 8594.02s]  The players actually like play so safe
[8594.02s -> 8596.94s]  and they play to like for statistics, right?
[8596.94s -> 8599.54s]  They play like purely for the stats.
[8599.54s -> 8602.42s]  And then they can say that it was their teams fault
[8602.42s -> 8606.58s]  that they didn't win because they played really bad,
[8606.58s -> 8612.56s]  but they didn't die.
[8612.56s -> 8613.92s]  Because I mean, in theory,
[8613.92s -> 8618.08s]  I could have a perfect KDA on every 80 carry I play, right?
[8618.08s -> 8620.48s]  All I have to do is literally walk up,
[8620.48s -> 8622.32s]  get one kill and then AFK
[8622.32s -> 8625.72s]  and stand in the base of the rest of the game.
[8625.72s -> 8626.28s]  And I could be like,
[8626.28s -> 8627.64s]  you know, why's my team not able to carry?
[8627.64s -> 8631.47s]  What's happening?
[8631.47s -> 8632.35s]  Right?
[8632.35s -> 8633.95s]  Like you could literally do that.
[8633.95s -> 8636.75s]  No, I seriously think the person's self-gaslighting himself.
[8638.11s -> 8638.95s]  Like I'm serious.
[8638.95s -> 8640.91s]  I think this person's like self-gaslighting,
[8640.91s -> 8644.11s]  where they're like, oh, it's my team's fault every game, right?
[8644.11s -> 8646.91s]  They're always blaming their team for their loses
[8646.91s -> 8648.31s]  and then mistakes and shit.
[8648.31s -> 8651.79s]  And it's sad because there's a reason you're D2.
[8651.79s -> 8653.19s]  And I'm not saying that to be toxic.
[8653.19s -> 8655.91s]  I'm saying that you haven't improved in four years.
[8655.91s -> 8657.47s]  And you haven't improved because all you're doing
[8657.47s -> 8659.75s]  is playing to blame your team every single game.
[8659.75s -> 8661.91s]  When I just saw like 500 mistakes
[8661.91s -> 8671.64s]  that you made that we could have won the game off of early game.
[8671.64s -> 8673.44s]  Here, I remember somebody wanted me to play a cake.
[8673.44s -> 8679.60s]  game last game. So we're gonna play Kate. I don't remember I don't remember who it was in the chat.
[8679.60s -> 8685.20s]  Somebody like two people said Kate, but we'll do a cake game for you guys. I got you guys somewhere.
[8703.17s -> 8707.33s]  All right. I'm gonna take Ghost Flash because they have three madly champs,
[8707.33s -> 8711.41s]  four madly champs. They've they've re-conzed, clad, Gregus. I'm gonna take Ghost Flash.
[8713.17s -> 8716.93s]  These are gonna be my runes this game. I'm gonna take a little more MR because I don't think we're
[8716.93s -> 8720.05s]  we're going to be fighting too much in lane, we're pretty much just going to be poking them
[8720.77s -> 8724.29s]  with comic hate. So I'm going to take a little bit extra in mark because I'm going to be playing
[8724.29s -> 8737.41s]  for mid to like him. I'm just scaling. And these are going to be the ruins that I take. You can
[8737.41s -> 8743.33s]  cause on 80 carry or the easier to play once. And 80 carry, I usually do like when I'm playing on
[8743.33s -> 8747.41s]  this account right now, this is like my teaching accounts. It's a little lower and more right
[8747.41s -> 8754.29s]  it's like D1 low masters. I usually play 80 carries that like the chat wants to see me play.
[8754.29s -> 8757.25s]  So that you guys can learn like good and bad match ups and things like that's
[8758.85s -> 8764.77s]  The last two games I got way too tilted by shitty support players like egos and all that shit
[8764.77s -> 8768.29s]  I got way too frustrated and I played bad the last two games so we're gonna
[8769.25s -> 8771.73s]  Honestly, I'm just gonna mute these people with a very start of the game
[8772.53s -> 8777.33s]  Normally I wouldn't suggest you maybe people because like playing as a team is really important
[8778.69s -> 8782.13s]  Because like you know you need to communicate in all that shit, but I am just like I'm gonna mute them
[8782.13s -> 8793.11s]  because I do my mental taking a fucking hit right now, so we're gonna just chill and play.
[8793.11s -> 8799.11s]  I just don't know how to play Naba. I think Naba is really good. I just don't know how to play her.
[8799.11s -> 8807.64s]  I think she's a great champ. Like I've been getting shit on by Naba on my main account.
[8807.64s -> 8822.88s]  Like a lot of grandmaster Naba hasn't been dumbstring me. I think she's just really good at abusing solo queue.
[8822.88s -> 8828.88s]  Like the issue with Nila is from what I've seen all the losses I've had with Nila.
[8828.88s -> 8835.88s]  People don't, it's like the thing I was telling you about before, people don't play aggressively in the lower E-Los,
[8835.88s -> 8840.88s]  like even in Grandmaster, people don't play aggressively enough, it sounds crazy to say that, but it's true.
[8840.88s -> 8845.88s]  They don't play aggressively enough in Wayne, so you can get away with just picking Nila and scaling.
[8845.88s -> 8850.88s]  And Nila at like one item, you'll always be up in levels, right? Because that's how the champion works.
[8850.88s -> 8855.88s]  the champion works in like you'll always be up in levels because of her passive so
[8855.88s -> 8862.64s]  you basically just like scale through existing it's pretty it's pretty interesting
[8862.64s -> 8872.01s]  alright so we're playing Kate Karma I missed the minion because I suck I'm gonna
[8872.01s -> 8884.78s]  ward this bush uh just because I don't want to return in the bush so now that the
[8884.78s -> 8889.18s]  bush isn't warding anymore um okay warded nice I was gonna say what I want to do is I
[8889.18s -> 8893.64s]  I actually want to play, oh I suck.
[8893.64s -> 8896.12s]  I actually want to play, oh man, I'm so bad at Kate.
[8896.12s -> 8898.20s]  I want to play on the top side of the wave,
[8898.20s -> 8901.32s]  so that I'm not standing near the bushes, right?
[8901.32s -> 8902.88s]  Because if you stand near the bushes,
[8904.24s -> 8905.36s]  the recon can obviously like W,
[8905.36s -> 8906.20s]  and I just get fucked.
[8906.20s -> 8908.60s]  So I'd rather play in a safer spot.
[8909.88s -> 8911.68s]  Can't wait, I missed 2c, I'm so fucking bad.
[8912.76s -> 8915.52s]  Now I want to push in wave 3, and I want to go by a call.
[8915.52s -> 8925.72s]  So I'm going to ping to push.
[8925.72s -> 8926.56s]  Okay.
[8926.56s -> 8930.56s]  So I actually want to back here and I'm going to go back home.
[8930.56s -> 8933.56s]  So this is called a cheetah recall.
[8933.56s -> 8937.56s]  You usually have perfect CS to back on this timer.
[8937.56s -> 8939.56s]  Go and you can go back home.
[8939.56s -> 8940.56s]  Okay.
[8940.56s -> 8944.56s]  This is like something that you can do if you're in a lane that's going to be permishawning.
[8944.56s -> 8949.56s]  So what happens is the reason that's called the cheetah recall is because we push the wave in.
[8949.56s -> 8952.56s]  They had to stay and form the wave, right?
[8952.56s -> 8953.56s]  Now watch.
[8953.56s -> 8957.89s]  They have to push this wave in, right?
[8957.89s -> 8964.09s]  Now, if karma was here instead of roaming this room is fine by the way, but if she was here instead of roaming she could actually hold the wave
[8965.09s -> 8969.29s]  And if you notice here, I don't actually miss that many minions, right?
[8969.49s -> 8978.91s]  We're chillin. Now we can so-push this or safe. I should actually fast-push this
[8979.81s -> 8987.81s]  Because I wanted to bounce I don't want to so-push this, but I can't I can't fast-push this at level three by myself
[8988.29s -> 8994.29s]  So we're just gonna chill
[8994.29s -> 9000.61s]  Hey, man's really good at abusing like early lane phase bullying just based on like what our kit does
[9000.85s -> 9003.49s]  We see we're con on the map top side to get you see that's
[9004.45s -> 9011.11s]  So because we see we're con I can walk up a bit and we could play a little aggro here
[9011.51s -> 9022.20s]  You can kind of see like I don't have to play behind the minion wave. You see what I'm doing to this guy, right?
[9022.20s -> 9034.07s]  I hate this game. We can quit. We can we can four foot. It's fun. I hate this game. I hate I really hate this game
[9034.07s -> 9036.07s]  Dude, what is wrong with me right now?
[9036.07s -> 9038.07s]  It's like my brain doesn't work.
[9038.07s -> 9042.40s]  It's the 280k nerf. Telling you.
[9042.40s -> 9048.72s]  So, Recon's gonna be bought right now.
[9048.72s -> 9051.72s]  I know he's gonna be bought.
[9051.72s -> 9053.72s]  So I need to be a little care.
[9053.72s -> 9056.72s]  Now, my karma is here.
[9056.72s -> 9059.93s]  There we go.
[9059.93s -> 9060.93s]  So, you know what I didn't use any spells?
[9060.93s -> 9065.52s]  I'm not just chilling.
[9065.52s -> 9066.52s]  Dude.
[9066.52s -> 9068.52s]  Are you kidding me, man?
[9068.52s -> 9072.22s]  I'm gonna be honest.
[9072.22s -> 9074.22s]  I'm getting really tilted by these players now.
[9074.22s -> 9080.54s]  Now, like the Recon W's in, they just stand there and watch me die.
[9080.54s -> 9082.78s]  Okay, it's fine.
[9082.78s -> 9084.34s]  Listen, I'm not going to get too mad about it.
[9084.34s -> 9085.34s]  It's fine.
[9085.34s -> 9088.28s]  I should have flashed the knock-up, I guess, even though in reality, I should never
[9088.28s -> 9092.98s]  have to flash the knock-up, but I should have flashed it because I can't trust the teammates.
[9092.98s -> 9095.86s]  So what I'm saying is right there, Carmen and Fiddler were both right here.
[9095.86s -> 9097.54s]  I was being chased down.
[9097.54s -> 9098.54s]  They stood here.
[9098.54s -> 9100.42s]  They didn't walk up to do anything.
[9100.42s -> 9103.18s]  They just stood and waited.
[9103.18s -> 9110.94s]  pisses me off because I hate when players play selfish and scared. It's my biggest pet peeve.
[9113.87s -> 9118.75s]  It drives me fucking crazy man. Sorry, I'm getting I'm losing my mind.
[9122.70s -> 9129.64s]  Like it's so easy. It's fine though. I shouldn't have walked up and egoed it. It's on me.
[9141.28s -> 9156.25s]  I want to so push this way. I'm losing it. This by the way would be the example of a bad
[9156.25s -> 9163.16s]  time for a comment of Rome. She needs to come back bot. There's absolutely no reason for
[9163.16s -> 9165.40s]  for the room on that timer.
[9165.40s -> 9167.36s]  There's also no reason for it to be in that bush over there.
[9167.36s -> 9168.76s]  We should be playing up to try,
[9168.76s -> 9170.60s]  we're playing Kate Karma, right?
[9170.60s -> 9171.56s]  We should be playing forward
[9171.56s -> 9172.96s]  so that we can actually be aggressive.
[9174.04s -> 9175.32s]  Kate Karma's a wane bully line.
[9175.32s -> 9177.44s]  We don't want to sit here and just do nothing.
[9177.44s -> 9179.28s]  If you pick Karma, you want to be aggressive.
[9179.28s -> 9180.12s]  You want to be playing up.
[9180.12s -> 9180.96s]  You want to be stunning.
[9180.96s -> 9182.52s]  You want to be doing aggressive things.
[9182.52s -> 9186.55s]  Playing the game.
[9186.55s -> 9187.23s]  We're up to six.
[9187.23s -> 9188.83s]  I'd really like to go in, yeah.
[9197.03s -> 9198.63s]  That was actually not bad by the Karma.
[9198.63s -> 9201.47s]  She w the Ziya, and then I got to trap off of it.
[9201.47s -> 9202.83s]  So that wasn't too bad.
[9203.15s -> 9224.36s]  Not the worst. Not bad. That was good. That was good.
[9225.36s -> 9229.36s]  Really nice, really nice. Okay, so I'm going to back here because I don't want to overstay for the way.
[9229.36s -> 9243.77s]  I'm going to grab boots.
[9245.77s -> 9249.60s]  You don't want to think a lot of it is, too.
[9250.60s -> 9254.60s]  I think a lot of it is people get really scared when they, like, Rakan is really strong in this meta, right?
[9254.60s -> 9260.60s]  Like he's very, very powerful. He is like numbers are a little too high right now, so like everything he does is just a little too good.
[9260.60s -> 9266.60s]  So I think people get nervous around Recon, especially with Ziya, because it's like when people would get nervous around Nami-Ocean.
[9266.60s -> 9269.60s]  The lane like plays itself, it's very strong, it's very hard to beat.
[9269.60s -> 9280.39s]  But you can still see people making mistakes when they play the lane, so you've got to watch for that type of stuff.
[9280.39s -> 9290.75s]  Now, a good way to play against Ziya, once you hit 6, is you don't want to...
[9290.75s -> 9296.75s]  You don't want to ever walk melee range of her, or give her the ability to just kill you with the feathers.
[9296.75s -> 9298.75s]  Your main goal here is going to be
[9298.99s -> 9300.99s]  Triance day in a good spot when it comes to
[9302.03s -> 9304.03s]  Fathers I got one of the side of her
[9304.39s -> 9308.67s]  The side of her is the best option like where she can't pull in like I'll get hit by maybe a few
[9308.83s -> 9313.59s]  But she can't pull in all of them. That's a really
[9314.23s -> 9317.67s]  Key thing when playing versus her because I remember back in the day
[9317.67s -> 9320.33s]  I didn't know how to play Versailles and I would always get fucking frustrated this shit
[9320.99s -> 9323.95s]  So Recon's five I wanted to have C Recon's five
[9325.07s -> 9327.07s]  We shouldn't be able to die here
[9327.07s -> 9334.21s]  I want to push this wave in, but I also need to stay away from where the Recon can be.
[9334.21s -> 9348.97s]  So if you want to push wave, staying in and reset the wave, make sure that you're standing as far away as you can from where they can engage on you.
[9348.97s -> 9353.97s]  Now they're about to be 6 Recon is, so they have a really strong level 6, she has pickaxe and Nune Quiver.
[9353.97s -> 9357.97s]  We do want to be a little hesitant here, we don't want to fight.
[9357.97s -> 9360.97s]  Now I'm going to kind of push the Senate bit.
[9360.97s -> 9367.11s]  We should have been spam pushing the whole wave because that's how K Karma plays. We just push push push push
[9367.83s -> 9371.47s]  But we played that early roam by Karma
[9372.75s -> 9374.75s]  Kind of put us behind on that
[9375.31s -> 9379.33s]  It's not a big deal. It's just something that we have to adjust
[9382.96s -> 9385.64s]  Why does this say 88 and this say 90?
[9387.92s -> 9408.39s]  Which one is it? Is it 88 or 90 I mean that guy's bad
[9408.39s -> 9419.90s]  I don't know what that karma's thinking, but we probably have to give this trick.
[9419.90s -> 9422.90s]  I mean, maybe we could fight it if it'll have all to eat, but...
[9422.90s -> 9431.56s]  Here I'm not having all the other's nowhere.
[9431.56s -> 9433.56s]  The higher one counts ward kills.
[9433.56s -> 9435.56s]  Why?
[9435.56s -> 9437.56s]  I think that's so stupid.
[9437.56s -> 9440.56s]  So they might try and engage here.
[9440.56s -> 9442.56s]  Unless they somehow know...
[9442.56s -> 9443.56s]  Fettles in the bush.
[9443.56s -> 9446.56s]  Which would be impressive, because we know it's not warded.
[9446.56s -> 9450.13s]  So that'd be pretty impressive if they knew that.
[9450.13s -> 9479.18s]  We could actually refts. I'm just gonna ghost. This is crazy. What the fuck?
[9479.86s -> 9490.14s]  Oh, this is interesting. They saw a fed 100%. Yeah, I don't know where though. It must have cuz he used this thing
[9491.58s -> 9498.22s]  But I'll use this is whatever it's called. His effigy. I'd have to go look
[9502.26s -> 9511.04s]  1 million. Oh, I guess I didn't see it. I should back. I can get dope here. We don't know where Greg is. Like if Greg is happens to be like
[9511.04s -> 9515.94s]  He's over this wall or something. I can get down really easy. I'm greeting really hard
[9517.16s -> 9519.16s]  greeting usually gets you killed
[9519.16s -> 9527.52s]  Typically I shouldn't be doing this. They're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right?
[9528.16s -> 9530.16s]  It's like
[9530.16s -> 9536.12s]  If you notice something's gonna be a bad habit, you should not do it. Just cue the bush
[9537.88s -> 9540.16s]  Okay, that was I meant use like an actual cue
[9540.16s -> 9546.56s]  They could also be in the alcove, so my little hesitant, but that's fine.
[9546.56s -> 9556.84s]  Okay, so the reason I stayed was because now I have my- I have my method, correct?
[9556.84s -> 9561.84s]  Because we finished the coal and we finished the method at the same time, or finished the wave, so.
[9561.84s -> 9566.84s]  Now I have two options. I go gale force here, to dodge a lot of their shits,
[9566.84s -> 9570.84s]  or I can do what sounds like a fun option.
[9570.84s -> 9573.84s]  We're going to do shield though.
[9573.84s -> 9582.00s]  I'm gonna show you guys why I like shield bow on Caitlyn. It's not the best mythic, but it's good into certain
[9582.00s -> 9591.20s]  comps. If you don't want to get, uh, yeah. Because I have a lacquer to do this game, I don't
[9591.20s -> 9602.03s]  have bloodline, right? So I kind of want to go shield bow, and then I'm gonna end up going,
[9602.03s -> 9612.67s]  uh, either iE or I'm gonna end up going, like bloodthirsty seconds, iE or BT. Probably
[9612.67s -> 9625.42s]  I think I think it's actually easier to go IE this game by app.
[9625.42s -> 9626.78s]  This is a kind of boring game.
[9626.78s -> 9637.18s]  Our team's done really well though, so we just chill.
[9637.18s -> 9638.98s]  We got to be able to care.
[9638.98s -> 9655.70s]  Okay.
[9655.70s -> 9657.94s]  It was kind of hard to do anything there.
[9657.94s -> 9659.90s]  Even though I got a few autos on the Gragas,
[9659.90s -> 9667.34s]  it's a little difficult to actually play the game there.
[9667.34s -> 9669.98s]  Because if I walk up too far, like see we're concert,
[9669.98s -> 9675.39s]  if I walk up too far, I just get killed by Rakan.
[9675.39s -> 9679.84s]  All right, I'm just going to reset and go get boots.
[9679.84s -> 9688.84s]  Typically, any carry is really fucking boring in games like this, where you can't really blow the game open.
[9688.84s -> 9697.33s]  Oh, I'm dead. Maybe? Wait, karma shielding me? I'm not dead.
[9697.33s -> 9701.54s]  Nice.
[9701.54s -> 9705.49s]  Fuck!
[9720.86s -> 9723.86s]  Motivucker COVID me, man. There's like, go.
[9723.86s -> 9728.74s]  We can fight this though. They have no ults.
[9728.74s -> 9737.11s]  Like this is actually fightable. They have no XIRR and no, uh,
[9737.51s -> 9746.07s]  Braggassar and this is also why it's really important that you relate to your team the cooldowns of your team
[9746.95s -> 9752.55s]  Remember that don't forget that if somebody uses a big cooldown tell your team because that was in a legal dragon
[9752.79s -> 9756.59s]  Right like they just that was one of the most illegal things I've seen in the wild
[9757.59s -> 9781.90s]  Help me completely grief that that's another very very very important thing that you need to take away from playing
[9781.90s -> 9784.94s]  League and being like this is the one I was saying about team work and shit earlier
[9786.30s -> 9789.82s]  Being good at the game is a lot of spreading knowledge as well, right?
[9790.94s -> 9795.98s]  Like if you if your team doesn't know if a flash is up or down you have to play completely differently, right?
[9796.38s -> 9800.06s]  Like you got to think about the game and that in terms of that as well like how many times have you seen like
[9800.54s -> 9804.14s]  You know, you're like, oh, I can walk up here if this guy can't flash out. May or something, right?
[9804.62s -> 9814.14s]  It happens all the time. What if I can kill a dust blade's it?
[9814.14s -> 9820.97s]  I don't know. I probably could.
[9820.97s -> 9832.34s]  I should go mad.
[9832.34s -> 9840.18s]  What do you think about Timo and other top win as AD carry?
[9840.18s -> 9844.18s]  I play Timo AD carry when I'm playing for fun sometimes.
[9844.18s -> 9855.47s]  It's okay. Yo go look on your game man.
[9855.47s -> 9858.47s]  So during the mid game is Caitlyn,
[9858.47s -> 9860.47s]  a few things that I can kinda teach you.
[9860.47s -> 9862.47s]  This was kind of a boring lane phase, right?
[9862.47s -> 9863.47s]  We didn't really do that much.
[9863.47s -> 9865.47s]  The lane phase was essentially just like,
[9865.47s -> 9869.47s]  we died once and then, you know, everything all hell broke loose.
[9869.47s -> 9884.26s]  When you're walk up the fights like this, make sure that you're putting traps down in places where the enemy has to walk.
[9884.26s -> 9885.26s]  Just like that.
[9885.26s -> 9890.26s]  Plain, playing Caitlyn is not always about just like autoing and getting queues and shits.
[9890.26s -> 9894.26s]  If you noticed during that fight, I put two traps here, two traps here.
[9894.26s -> 9902.89s]  I forced the enemy team into like a location where they had to eat traps, or they can't find us, right?
[9902.89s -> 9918.39s]  And even if like, they've void the traps, they're still having to like move their character in a very unique specific way that they probably don't want to do.
[9918.39s -> 9923.39s]  So you should always be thinking, where should I put these traps down at the start of bite, not like how do I get autos off?
[9923.39s -> 9931.39s]  Think about using your traps to zone, and that I control the team fight before the fight starts rather than using it to do damage.
[9931.39s -> 9934.39s]  Because they'll step in the traps themselves.
[9934.39s -> 9938.39s]  People are stupid. They're bad. People are paying attention.
[9938.39s -> 9940.39s]  Everything. I'm bad.
[9940.39s -> 9945.39s]  You know what I mean? People can't pay attention to every bush that you're putting traps in during a big fight.
[9945.39s -> 9961.61s]  It's too much attention span. Nobody has it.
[9961.61s -> 9963.98s]  Nice.
[9963.98s -> 9967.49s]  I'm gonna grab this run.
[9967.49s -> 9970.49s]  Oh, big tip for all the 80 carries in chat. Guys.
[9970.49s -> 9972.49s]  I'm gonna tell you right now.
[9972.49s -> 9977.49s]  Once the 20 minute mark happens in league, your junglers camps are no longer his.
[9977.49s -> 9984.99s]  I know, I know junglers are gonna hate me for this, okay? Listen, if you're a jungle player, you're like fuck this guy now, I hate him. Listen, you know it's true.
[9984.99s -> 9997.49s]  You know at 20 minutes, your camps no longer, like they're not yours anymore, man. Okay? Like you, you, you are full items at this point, okay? Like, I'm gonna be honest, you would, I'm taking your camps.
[9997.49s -> 10012.11s]  I'm trying to get my third item as fast as humanly possible because 80 carries a spike
[10012.11s -> 10014.51s]  on three items extremely hard.
[10014.51s -> 10024.87s]  I want to walk top but we have no vision of this area so it's a little scary.
[10024.87s -> 10034.72s]  Like I said I typically don't like to take jungles, camps, early game ever because like
[10034.72s -> 10039.80s]  that's why I say like at 20 minutes usually you have two items at this point if you're
[10039.80s -> 10042.60s]  like farming decent and you know etc.
[10042.60s -> 10046.44s]  Sometimes it'll be faster, but usually it's around average of like you'll have your items at this point.
[10046.44s -> 10073.38s]  Always be tabbing to the teamfights even if you're farming as well.
[10073.38s -> 10075.06s]  Zed is in this bush.
[10075.06s -> 10080.42s]  Wait, where is he?
[10080.42s -> 10082.30s]  Wait, I'm stupid, where do you go?
[10082.30s -> 10084.82s]  Oh, he died, I killed him.
[10084.82s -> 10093.35s]  Wow, I'm really smart.
[10093.35s -> 10095.35s]  I like didn't notice that I killed that guy.
[10095.35s -> 10097.35s]  I'm so dumb.
[10097.35s -> 10107.70s]  80 carry brain ripos.
[10107.70s -> 10112.10s]  I was like playing that so scared too, because I was like, I was like, is he there?
[10112.10s -> 10122.58s]  Pull the dragon out.
[10123.88s -> 10128.50s]  Oh, I asked this, yes, but what do you guys think the cool is looking dragon is I swear it's the
[10130.10s -> 10132.10s]  I think mountain Drake looks fucking sick
[10168.62s -> 10171.78s]  Welcome to the here. You saw that I like time to push man, right?
[10172.22s -> 10181.98s]  Jera hype that's mainly because we our carber just got picked off and I don't want to give them the option of pushing the wave
[10181.98s -> 10183.98s]  So by pushing the lane
[10183.98s -> 10207.96s]  Nice. By pushing the lane in, it takes away an option for the enemy.
[10207.96s -> 10211.96s]  That's something that a lot of people think, like, oh, I just want farm. I don't care about the farm, right?
[10211.96s -> 10218.96s]  Like, when I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game, and I'm pushing like a mid-wave in before a fight,
[10218.96s -> 10226.96s]  if we're just seeding around the barren, having that wave pushed in gives them gives us another option on like what we can do in the game.
[10226.96s -> 10231.96s]  And it takes you three seconds to push in. So, if the fight's already over,
[10231.96s -> 10238.30s]  And you have time always be paying attention to like trying to push in waves so that you can
[10239.02s -> 10242.72s]  Create a little bit of that pressure your hail. Thank you so much for the 14 man walk it back
[10243.72s -> 10246.02s]  What do I get next I kind of want to get BT?
[10247.08s -> 10251.61s]  I'm gonna be to
[10251.61s -> 10256.29s]  I could get Dom's but I think BT's better because the I already have over here, right?
[10256.29s -> 10261.97s]  So the shield from BT plus shield vote plus I I don't think I'll be able to die. I think I'm unkillable
[10261.97s -> 10265.09s]  Act actually, like actually uncillable.
[10265.09s -> 10268.77s]  So here I'm gonna actually give these camps the federal because he's literally
[10268.77s -> 10270.97s]  pathing to them and I want to be an asshole, but...
[10270.97s -> 10286.08s]  Wow.
[10286.08s -> 10288.08s]  What just happened?
[10288.08s -> 10290.08s]  I'm bad.
[10290.08s -> 10293.08s]  I feel like I got hooked by clad.
[10293.08s -> 10296.08s]  Oh, he flashed.
[10296.08s -> 10297.08s]  Okay.
[10297.08s -> 10302.08s]  I was like, I feel like what just happened was like, I missed position because I went up here, right?
[10302.08s -> 10305.08s]  Like I ghosted one up here because there was two people here, two people here.
[10305.08s -> 10309.72s]  I put traps down these kind of sloppy traps and then I positioned here and then clad flash
[10309.72s -> 10313.36s]  queued me under the yeah, okay that makes sense. I'm just bad.
[10313.36s -> 10326.73s]  It was okay though, because if the entire enemy team has to literally double flash on you
[10326.73s -> 10330.61s]  to kill you under the turret and then your team follows up. It's not that big of a deal.
[10330.61s -> 10333.37s]  Gal force would have saved me there though, actually.
[10333.37s -> 10340.66s]  Okay, Gal force totally would have saved me.
[10340.66s -> 10348.93s]  because he has serpents. Serpents definitely shits on Chobo. I'm kind of stupid for
[10348.93s -> 10355.55s]  going to Chobo this game. I wanted to try it out because I, before when I was playing
[10355.55s -> 10360.41s]  Caitlyn, I'd be for the IE or he worked on everything. Everybody would go, or there
[10360.41s -> 10364.61s]  was like one guy in Challenger would go shield bow into Chet every game, and I wanted to
[10364.61s -> 10368.35s]  see if like it was still liable, but there might just be better options than I always scale
[10368.35s -> 10382.03s]  force a B tier something oh my god i flashed late i'm dead dude i flashed late for some reason i'm
[10382.03s -> 10391.71s]  so dumb my bad i was given an mb like my brain is moving slowly like i can feel it turning
[10392.99s -> 10398.67s]  i was playing bad like i i was baiting the clad to to go in on me because karma was there
[10398.67s -> 10401.15s]  but what i need to do is i need to trap on top myself when he goes in
[10401.15s -> 10416.76s]  then I need to flash net and the clutch does. You can also just kill him. I was going to say they have nothing we just play for dragon here
[10422.12s -> 10427.40s]  I don't know why I'm playing so bad today. I play bad yesterday too. I don't know what's going on. I like brain is broken
[10445.05s -> 10490.43s]  Dude, the record was tragic so hard. Oh, I've made so many mistakes this game. I fucked up positioning mechanic farm
[10490.43s -> 10514.57s]  I don't think War Dom's is good this game, like they have no armor, like clad as
[10514.57s -> 10532.40s]  Merc Trids, which I feel like it's really bad indoor team, but oh a little tip that you guys
[10532.40s -> 10540.24s]  can have for Caitlyn too, when you are like barren's up in 50 seconds, right? So a little thing you can do,
[10540.24s -> 10548.24s]  It's actually kind of fun is you want to be at the objective before the like rule with on one of the objectives coming up you always want to be on that side of the map before the before the objective comes up
[10549.24s -> 10559.44s]  But you can put down traps in the bushes around the objectives and people will face Jacob and you can just one tap on my game
[10561.24s -> 10577.88s]  It's actually incredibly fun, but you just put them in the corners of the bushes where people have to walk like right here. I can put it right between the turret
[10589.92s -> 10591.92s]  I don't know why I didn't ghost.
[10591.92s -> 10597.25s]  I'll be honest, I have no idea why I didn't ghost.
[10597.25s -> 10600.25s]  I was like saving it for something. I'm not sure what.
[10600.25s -> 10604.01s]  Next year, a birthday present.
[10604.01s -> 10606.01s]  Who the fuck knows?
[10606.01s -> 10610.92s]  Oh, I could have one shot that guy. I thought it was better.
[10610.92s -> 10612.92s]  Kate.
[10612.92s -> 10614.92s]  I did a really classic combo right there.
[10614.92s -> 10616.92s]  I just didn't cue because I'm bad.
[10616.92s -> 10620.30s]  I should have, when he hit the trap, you're two headshots.
[10620.30s -> 10622.30s]  Sit on him for a few seconds. So what I should have done
[10622.30s -> 10626.30s]  is I should have instantly cueed on top of the trap, then auto auto and he would have done.
[10626.30s -> 10631.30s]  Because your Q does the max damage when they're trapped too, so it would have been like a just a perfect three shot.
[10631.80s -> 10633.30s]  But I said I
[10633.30s -> 10636.30s]  Don't like hate enough and my muscle memory is kind of trash sometimes, so
[10637.70s -> 10650.92s]  That was my bed. Oh, we're getting flooded.
[10652.02s -> 10671.88s]  I don't know where he is, but I shouldn't have done that.
[10674.77s -> 10678.77s]  I'm women testing really hard right now. I suggest you guys don't limit test.
[10678.77s -> 10683.77s]  Well, I actually do think you should limit test, but not if you want to win like play safer, like right there the play wasn't to go back in.
[10683.77s -> 10690.82s]  back in. The boy was like back off, but I wanted to see if I could like, I wanted to
[10690.82s -> 10699.22s]  see if I was terrible or not. You know, I was. But yeah, I mean, the combo with Kate is
[10699.22s -> 10705.38s]  like, if they're trapped, you want to queue while they're in the trap, essentially, because
[10705.38s -> 10712.54s]  your auto will always give you the range. So if you auto and then queue, when they're trapped,
[10712.54s -> 10719.54s]  not a lot of people know this because I just found this out like a few years, or like after I should have.
[10719.54s -> 10729.54s]  When you queue on top of a K-trap, the WhiteKate's queue works is when you queue, the initial, like, it hits initially and then it does less damage to the targets behind it, right?
[10729.54s -> 10739.54s]  It's very narrow and then it gets bigger. So when they're trapped though, it does the maximum queue damage that it can do in like the isolation of the queue.
[10739.54s -> 10742.78s]  So that's why when people are trapped you want to open up with your queue
[10745.09s -> 10752.05s]  You either want to net into the queue and then double auto or you want to net or you want to like you want to queue
[10752.73s -> 10757.23s]  Then trap net at the same time then double auto you base it's a very
[10757.81s -> 10761.37s]  Interesting way to play it you always want to try and overlay a trap on your trap
[10761.65s -> 10765.93s]  So when they get trapped you can overlay a second trap to either
[10765.93s -> 10767.81s]  in front of them or behind them.
[10767.81s -> 10770.45s]  And what'll happen is there's actually like a little mini,
[10770.45s -> 10772.97s]  like I want to say one second cool down
[10772.97s -> 10774.05s]  of being able to be trapped, right?
[10774.05s -> 10776.33s]  Like a little 1.5 to 2 second cool down.
[10776.33s -> 10778.17s]  But what can happen is they sit in the trap,
[10778.17s -> 10780.25s]  then what you can do is your net can slow them.
[10780.25s -> 10783.09s]  So you can actually queue in the first trap,
[10783.09s -> 10784.89s]  then you can drop a second trap,
[10784.89s -> 10786.77s]  net slow them into the second trap,
[10786.77s -> 10788.89s]  and then triple auto headshot them from all three
[10788.89s -> 10791.05s]  of the net, the two traps.
[10791.05s -> 10803.41s]  It's really complicated sounding, but this man
[10803.41s -> 10806.61s]  It redeemed end to my stream whenever you want.
[10813.40s -> 10823.67s]  What? Why? Why would you want to end my stream, right, though?
[10829.63s -> 10839.33s]  Why would you want to be that guy? Wow. Okay.
[10850.14s -> 10852.94s]  Don't you don't end just change the camera position.
[10854.54s -> 10863.49s]  Did you just spend one million points to tell me to put the camera back on the right side of my bucket?
[10863.49s -> 10881.54s]  No way. No way you just did that. I was like, this man is just flexing. He's just like,
[10881.54s -> 10889.89s]  yeah, I got some points to spare. I guess I could like throw them, you know, uh, alright,
[10889.89s -> 10912.38s]  fun. There's that better. Is that better? Drink water. Actually, that's a good one. I'll be
[10912.38s -> 10918.75s]  out of here. I'm going to get some water. Should we plan our main? I kind of want to try and hit
[10918.75s -> 10927.75s]  Yeah, let's get on our main account. It's like 1 PM. So it's like 3 PM Eastern. I think I can get cues at the moment.
[10927.75s -> 10934.45s]  I'll make it some water and then we'll queue up or we'll queue up then gets water.
[10934.45s -> 10946.54s]  Because I think it's light enough in the day I can get cues now without waiting 40 minutes.
[10946.54s -> 10957.14s]  By the way, it is it is a teaching stream when I'm doing that like a Katy Carrie Academy thing.
[10957.14s -> 10960.14s]  So if you guys have any questions you want to ask or like, you guys can ignore that.
[10960.14s -> 10964.30s]  ignore that. If you guys have any questions you want to ask or anything like that, you know,
[10964.30s -> 10968.62s]  if we're just chillin' between games, just ask whatever you want. I can answer a lot easier
[10968.62s -> 10973.58s]  between games that I can't in-game. You know, it's a lot easier for me to see that shit. I try
[10973.58s -> 10985.41s]  an answer in-game, but sometimes I'm like focusing in-shit. So it's a little harder. I'm getting
[10985.41s -> 10992.69s]  some water though, so I'll be right back. Okay. Talk amongst yourselves. Is Crack and Tro one
[10992.69s -> 10999.91s]  Okay. No, crackings gonna okay. You can go cracking them to bud their stir or crackin into the IE if you really need it if
[11000.45s -> 11002.65s]  If they have like tanks, so they have like Zion
[11003.61s -> 11008.81s]  So 20 stuff like that that you have to like you're the only damage. You'll say you're like the only tank killer on the team
[11008.81s -> 11011.81s]  You're they're the only 80 damage you have to go cracking sometimes
[11075.49s -> 11077.49s]  Brister
[13611.15s -> 13650.53s]  Just someies, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah hohEh, ah akhh чегоchetta, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah oh a
[13650.53s -> 13673.18s]  really well HP and mana. Oh, I don't have mana to arrow here guys. I do not want to arrow that because the the
[13673.18s -> 13684.30s]  Fiora can totally the Fiora can do whatever it's called and the Fiora can what's it whatever it's called the
[13685.10s -> 13687.50s]  W it if she's fast enough and I didn't want to get my team killed.
[13688.86s -> 13693.18s]  The real issue here is that we're forcing okay I'll tell you exactly what the real issue is
[13693.18s -> 13698.50s]  because we're forcing too many fights for no reason right now.
[13698.50s -> 13701.22s]  So we're all forcing tons of fights at the moment, right?
[13701.22s -> 13703.74s]  But there's no reason for us to force these fights.
[13703.74s -> 13707.10s]  That's why my team's getting tilted, right?
[13707.10s -> 13712.90s]  Like, for some reason, the Amumu and the TF are both just like inting.
[13712.90s -> 13717.10s]  And they're both getting frustrated, but we actually win the game if we play it slow.
[13717.10s -> 13727.48s]  Like, we can, we can slow play this game out in scale, but it just takes time.
[13727.48s -> 13733.48s]  I specifically picked Ash so that we can we had an answer for Zara because we have TF and Ash, right?
[13733.48s -> 13740.28s]  So we have we have a really good answer for him. The problem is, um, we need to like stop tilting and just like
[13740.28s -> 13747.68s]  Understand that we can deal with him later. He's not like a he's not like an asyl right like asyl is one of those champs that like you can't deal with
[13751.00s -> 13753.64s]  Why did my a mumu wait to use ulti?
[13754.76s -> 13756.76s]  What?
[13756.76s -> 13758.76s]  He was in range
[13759.88s -> 13773.14s]  I know he was. Oh, nice. Okay, we got a kill. We need TF to play the game too, though
[13774.64s -> 13777.66s]  Our TF is really tilted so he's just sitting bot a
[13780.98s -> 13786.78s]  Moomu is extra tilted too, but I mean, I'll be honest the Moomu is playing worse than TF. It's just that he's
[13787.22s -> 13791.02s]  Dude, I hate when stuff happens like this stop stop pinging the guy, man
[13791.42s -> 13794.44s]  He's already frustrated. You pinging him is not gonna make him less frustrated
[13795.34s -> 13797.34s]  You're just gonna piss him off more
[13797.34s -> 13803.04s]  But I just play it dude.
[13803.04s -> 13806.32s]  We have a really good team comp.
[13806.32s -> 13814.68s]  Like we're behind right now, but we have a good team comp.
[13814.68s -> 13818.24s]  We should give this dragon by the way.
[13818.24s -> 13819.24s]  They get 1,000%.
[13819.24s -> 13821.32s]  We don't have t-pulse.
[13821.32s -> 13824.04s]  Like maybe we could fight this, but the morgue's here,
[13824.04s -> 13825.56s]  so she can spell for my arrow.
[13825.56s -> 13826.56s]  They got rifts.
[13826.56s -> 13830.12s]  Like we should give the drink.
[13830.12s -> 13832.72s]  We also have no vision control of this area.
[13833.88s -> 13835.72s]  So this is another thing of like why,
[13835.72s -> 13839.08s]  You guys wonder why I play support in the C-Lo?
[13839.08s -> 13841.40s]  I gotta ask them why, oh, are you a support man now?
[13841.40s -> 13843.64s]  I'm still on 80, man, but the thing is,
[13843.64s -> 13847.32s]  it's really hard to play the game when your supports
[13847.32s -> 13849.36s]  don't ward correctly.
[13850.36s -> 13851.44s]  We can give this guys, we can give it.
[13851.44s -> 13853.36s]  It's not a huge deal, in ours top,
[13853.36s -> 13855.44s]  we do not have to fight this.
[13855.44s -> 13857.60s]  Guys, we don't have to fight this.
[13857.60s -> 13864.70s]  Let's back up, yeah, like this isn't a fight.
[13864.70s -> 13866.54s]  It's only second dragon, it's nothing.
[13867.86s -> 13880.06s]  Wow, I suck at CSN.
[13880.06s -> 13882.46s]  But you see how little vision control we have on the map right now.
[13882.46s -> 13884.18s]  We have one ward here and that's about it.
[13885.34s -> 13889.18s]  Vision control is, I say it's 90% of the game and solo queue.
[13889.18s -> 13891.70s]  That's why I feel like supports are like the unsung hero.
[13891.70s -> 13892.46s]  Like when you get a support,
[13892.46s -> 13895.22s]  you notice how to properly throw out vision control.
[13895.22s -> 13902.76s]  It feels insane.
[13902.76s -> 13903.92s]  We just got to push.
[13905.04s -> 13906.92s]  I do have Hawkshot in a second.
[13906.92s -> 13908.56s]  We can see if they're on this.
[13909.84s -> 13910.68s]  Okay, they're not.
[13912.36s -> 13913.24s]  I can ball me.
[13913.24s -> 13916.51s]  We can back up.
[13916.51s -> 13925.09s]  Cosics is above me right now. Okay, Cosics waste his ult. That's not bad
[13926.83s -> 13928.83s]  We should back I
[13928.83s -> 13932.99s]  Don't want to take this fight TF could ulti, but he's not right?
[13934.17s -> 13938.93s]  Like this this is one of those moments where like actually think we actually could have killed two of them right there if
[13938.93s -> 13940.93s]  Do you have falton
[13940.93s -> 13951.66s]  Because they were out of position really hard but again, it's not like I think they're gonna walk. I think Cosics is
[13951.66s -> 13957.42s]  Yeah, he's somewhere up here. I don't know where he is and I can't I can't I can't
[13957.42s -> 13962.80s]  I can't hawkshot. I wasted my hawkshot for this dragon or this barren. They could be
[13962.80s -> 13968.00s]  on barren. We need to check but I have no hawkshots. Okay, they're not. They're not. We're
[13968.00s -> 13986.00s]  chilling. Good. Good. Any 100 golds. Yeah, I'm aware I'm getting ganked. I'm fully
[13986.00s -> 14005.43s]  fucking aware. Trust me. I'm just trying to force them to make a choice. Probably wasn't
[14005.43s -> 14022.40s]  a great use in my ghost but I say we bail. I need to go get my item. As a real
[14022.40s -> 14039.57s]  Just pushing aside somehow. I'm contested over there. Somebody is TP bought. What what the fuck is this a mu mu doing?
[14040.45s -> 14054.60s]  What is my team doing? What are you guys doing? This is so awkward man. I mean guys
[14055.72s -> 14059.72s]  Guys kill the cosics. Oh, thank god. I
[14060.92s -> 14064.60s]  Don't know why cosics just dove to kill me of all people
[14065.96s -> 14069.64s]  My man just like wanted me dead. He was like yeah fuck that 80 carry guy
[14070.04s -> 14108.70s]  Like okay, sure, fuck me, what do I want, if I need damage, but I don't know what gives me the highest damage here, maybe just, I don't know, maybe just PD, not, I'm not actually sure, I would be good, but it doesn't give me like more, it gives you like, I use interesting in this position, like I almost want more movement speed from the like PD,
[14108.70s -> 14113.70s]  Even though normally, like the utility is better, like maybe BT is still the best, and I'm just trolling.
[14113.70s -> 14126.36s]  We can just do Dragon right now. They have no TP or Baron. I think we totally actually could do this.
[14126.36s -> 14134.74s]  I'm down to try if you want to, Ranger. They got two people bought. They're setting up for Dragon Vision right now.
[14134.74s -> 14143.57s]  I'm actually kind of down to just try and play for Baron here.
[14143.57s -> 14177.04s]  I think we could make Baron here and force them to walk into us with my arrow.
[14177.04s -> 14183.05s]  I want to stay together because I don't know where the cause exists.
[14183.05s -> 14194.58s]  Found him.
[14194.58s -> 14195.58s]  What is my mimo doing?
[14195.58s -> 14196.58s]  Dude, he has smite.
[14196.58s -> 14199.58s]  I pull it out if you're going to do this, right?
[14199.58s -> 14201.58s]  I use your brain, man.
[14201.58s -> 14219.16s]  All right, now we do Baron though, we have to.
[14219.16s -> 14224.46s]  We have to do Baron.
[14224.46s -> 14227.46s]  This is like one of the worst players that ever seen this in the movie.
[14227.46s -> 14229.46s]  He has no clue what he's doing, by the way.
[14229.46s -> 14240.01s]  like he's so dumb he's like flaming the TF he's in his mind he's so angry at this
[14240.01s -> 14244.29s]  TF that he's ignoring every single thing that's going on like he's ignoring that
[14244.29s -> 14248.93s]  like the dragon was a bad call to begin with and if we are gonna do that dragon
[14248.93s -> 14252.05s]  we have to zone the fucking jungle or because he has fucking
[14252.05s -> 14259.97s]  smite right so it's like what are you talking about that this player is a crazy
[14259.97s -> 14264.29s]  It just feels to me like they're so angry at everything. It's kind of funny
[14266.32s -> 14271.04s]  Okay, I got three items now. I went for the PD because I kind of think the extra movement speed in the extra
[14272.04s -> 14277.81s]  It'll help a lot. I will say both the junglers are playing really well
[14278.53s -> 14280.53s]  This game is like
[14280.53s -> 14282.53s]  Interesting
[14282.53s -> 14286.29s]  Like both the assassin junglers are playing pretty well the enemy Xaris playing pretty decent
[14293.22s -> 14298.82s]  What that is not a I mean that was embarrassing like I don't even
[14298.82s -> 14300.82s]  and have words for that.
[14301.82s -> 14303.82s]  Like I genuinely don't have words for that shit.
[14306.32s -> 14307.32s]  I missed.
[14307.32s -> 14314.20s]  I can't see. We have no vision, man.
[14314.20s -> 14322.73s]  Like we have no vision.
[14322.73s -> 14326.73s]  Nothing's warded because the moon didn't put any wards down.
[14328.73s -> 14334.73s]  So I can't fight because literally we're standing there in this area and there's nothing warded.
[14334.73s -> 14342.86s]  The best part is all a moon would have to do was not die before that fight and we auto win.
[14343.86s -> 14349.90s]  But we were winning so hard, but this Amumu is actually solo losing us the game with this fucking ego
[14350.82s -> 14353.22s]  God support players are so bad at league
[14355.98s -> 14359.29s]  Actually
[14359.29s -> 14365.97s]  And they'll deflect support players will why do themselves about how good they are and tell them that it's always their teams fault
[14366.17s -> 14373.21s]  But they'll drop nine deaths have nine KP in a fucking 23 kill game and then blame their fucking team
[14373.21s -> 14405.91s]  team. It's crazy. Please ward things, man. Oh my god. He's dead again. Guys, why are we up
[14405.91s -> 14421.93s]  here top? Why are we top guys? Why are we three manning top right now? Holy crap. My teammates
[14421.93s -> 14433.30s]  are absolute apes. Like what am I watching, man? They just three man's top. Oh my
[14433.30s -> 14440.40s]  God, like these are the worst players that I've ever fucking seen.
[14441.40s -> 14446.40s]  Like we had the game in our hands and then all of a sudden my team's like, you know what?
[14446.40s -> 14450.40s]  I don't actually want to win and I'm like, why? And they're like, well, you see.
[14451.40s -> 14454.40s]  I have an ego and you're like, oh, I see.
[14454.40s -> 14457.40s]  This is why I can't play 80 Karyan C.
[14457.40s -> 14460.40s]  I'm sorry. I can't. I have to play support in the C.
[14460.40s -> 14463.40s]  Oh, because 80 Karyans actually not playable.
[14463.40s -> 14470.64s]  When the entire game is decided by jungle, support, and mid.
[14470.64s -> 14475.16s]  AD Carry just does not decide any of the League of Legends games below Grandmaster.
[14475.16s -> 14476.16s]  Not one of them.
[14476.16s -> 14480.96s]  Like last game, we popped off when we won because we were the better AD Carry, right?
[14480.96s -> 14483.12s]  This game, it doesn't matter.
[14483.12s -> 14488.00s]  Because TF does 11k damage, doesn't ulti bot more than one time.
[14488.00s -> 14495.30s]  The Rengar did well, NAR did well, but they also had a horrible macro.
[14495.30s -> 14500.30s]  Like it is insane to me, how easy support is as a role, and I just how dog shit every
[14500.30s -> 14502.70s]  support player is on the server.
[14502.70s -> 14506.18s]  Like your role requires zero thought.
[14506.18s -> 14514.22s]  Your thought when playing support is, do I get vision or not if no where can I be the most
[14514.22s -> 14515.78s]  useful?
[14515.78s -> 14517.78s]  Your thought should never be.
[14517.78s -> 14529.83s]  games over my team sucks. It drives me ludicrous. I'm sorry that I have to play support
[14529.83s -> 14533.99s]  on this account to climb, but it's crazy how dog shit 80 carriers when you're so
[14533.99s -> 14540.07s]  what you're doing in masters. Like in GM, well if it's a full GM game, 80 carries easiest fuck.
[14540.07s -> 14544.39s]  Like if everybody has a brain activity and they're not idiots, 80 carriers amazing.
[14544.39s -> 14548.39s]  Favorite role in the game? When you're playing with people who don't know what they're doing
[14548.39s -> 14553.35s]  and you're actively trying to climb and improve, it genuinely feels like I'm pulling out a
[14553.35s -> 14559.83s]  ball hair with my tweezers or pulling out my ball hairs with tweezers. Like one by one. It is so
[14559.83s -> 14574.28s]  painful. It's crazy. Like let's take a look at this this support man. Right now 97 LP negative one
[14574.28s -> 14581.88s]  rate right? I could I could literally tell that he was not a good player in the first 30 seconds of
[14581.88s -> 14595.14s]  that game. I'm sorry I'm being mean but dude this has been driving me crazy. Like look at the
[14595.14s -> 14601.62s]  way the support I had last game. Also, can I ask you question, why am I even allowed? Why
[14601.62s -> 14610.42s]  am I even allowed to be in games with a challenger support one game? I win the game. Then
[14610.42s -> 14628.03s]  immediately it puts me in a game with a 97 LP master support. What is this matchmaking? This
[14628.03s -> 14666.09s]  is insane. That's crazy. I don't even, I'm wondering why, so I'm gonna go on a rant
[14666.09s -> 14671.89s]  for a second. Why is this allowed? Why can you be in a game? Why can I be in a game with
[14671.89s -> 14678.89s]  a literal guy who's about to promote to challenger? Right? We win the game and then the
[14678.89s -> 14701.17s]  very next game, it puts me in a game where the guy who's 97 L.P. This isn't sane. Sorry,
[14701.17s -> 14702.85s]  That's just frustrating as fuck.
[14704.29s -> 14709.38s]  Because it's like such bad game design, right?
[14709.38s -> 14718.12s]  Like that's 900 LP difference.
[14718.12s -> 14722.84s]  And the thing is, this guy doesn't have good MMR, right?
[14722.84s -> 14726.80s]  Like it's not, it's not like this guy has good MMR, right?
[14727.96s -> 14729.72s]  Because we'll get his games.
[14729.72s -> 14732.00s]  He's playing with all master's players.
[14732.00s -> 14735.96s]  They're all like 100 LP masters, 70 LP, 30 LP, right?
[14737.20s -> 14738.04s]  It doesn't make sense.
[14738.04s -> 14740.28s]  It's not like his MMR is high.
[14740.28s -> 14745.28s]  So why is this guy getting into like a 600 LP grandmaster game?
[14746.40s -> 14748.80s]  Why are we putting that guy in the game?
[14748.80s -> 14749.64s]  That's so frustrating.
[14749.64s -> 14757.40s]  Sorry, I just need a defense.
[14757.40s -> 14760.04s]  How do you know which AD carry pick in each situation?
[14760.04s -> 14762.80s]  It's a lot of knowledge, a lot of knowledge.
[14764.60s -> 14768.44s]  Well, you have to know a lot of shit.
[14768.44s -> 14770.44s]  Like what the enemy champions do,
[14770.44s -> 14773.04s]  what your champions need to do to win the game,
[14773.04s -> 14776.28s]  what the wind cons are, you can just pick,
[14777.28s -> 14778.84s]  it would be honest though, you could just pick,
[14781.76s -> 14783.40s]  like there are 80 carries in the current meta
[14783.40s -> 14784.92s]  where you can just pick that are blinds.
[14784.92s -> 14787.28s]  Like I was making it to your list, I forgot about it.
[14787.28s -> 14788.80s]  But I mean, you can blind pick Jinks
[14788.80s -> 14790.04s]  pretty much every game.
[14791.44s -> 14793.28s]  Like Jinks is just blindable every game, pretty much,
[14793.28s -> 14794.40s]  she's insane.
[14794.40s -> 14795.88s]  She's super OP.
[14795.88s -> 14798.48s]  So if you ever just wanna play a champion
[14798.48s -> 14799.96s]  and then you think like, okay, I wanna practice AD,
[14799.96s -> 14801.16s]  like Jinks is insane.
[14801.16s -> 14802.00s]  Super good.
[14802.00s -> 14810.95s]  Draven's not blindable, but I do think he's really good if you're good at the game. Draven's very good.
[14810.95s -> 14819.95s]  He's harder than jinx by a mile, like Draven's about harder, but he's definitely good at carrying with only you as well.
[14819.95s -> 14830.32s]  Like another blindable AD that I think it's like A tier is like Varus. You can blind pick Varus really easily because Varus doesn't really have counters.
[14830.32s -> 14835.68s]  Like he doesn't get countered by anything. He's more of like a you can pick him and then
[14836.16s -> 14841.20s]  Go even and your ulti will always be useful. You can look to like win lane. You can look to like
[14841.96s -> 14867.61s]  Engage things like that, right?
[14868.11s -> 14870.11s]  Okay, so this game
[14870.41s -> 14872.81s]  As the support I need to be tracking the jungler
[14874.79s -> 14876.79s]  So I'm gonna think where
[14876.79s -> 14883.03s]  Always be thinking what the enemy jungler wants to accomplish and how to stop it. That's like a pretty big tip of advice I can give you guys
[14885.35s -> 14887.43s]  I think to yourself, like, okay, if I was the enemy jungler,
[14887.43s -> 14889.03s]  what would I be wanting to do against this Graeme?
[14889.03s -> 14890.03s]  So right, that's Lisa.
[14891.47s -> 14893.31s]  He's probably gonna want to either gank early,
[14893.31s -> 14895.31s]  my gank bot early, or he wants to
[14897.75s -> 14899.71s]  invade on certain timers, right?
[14899.71s -> 14901.59s]  Because that's like, what we is really good at
[14901.59s -> 14902.83s]  is ganking and invading.
[14902.83s -> 14904.03s]  So,
[14904.03s -> 14905.15s]  it's enough to your loom shit.
[14905.15s -> 14908.23s]  What I think I'm gonna try to do this game
[14908.23s -> 14911.75s]  is I'm gonna try and watch for early ganks
[14911.75s -> 14913.11s]  and early pressure bot lane,
[14913.11s -> 14915.31s]  like level two, level three ganks.
[14915.31s -> 14921.31s]  We're still going to be aggressive, but Lux took TP, which means this Lux does not plan on playing aggressive at all.
[14922.03s -> 14924.83s]  Like she basically, if anybody takes TP like this in a lane,
[14926.03s -> 14929.87s]  I already know from start of the game that they're not planning on doing anything.
[14929.87s -> 14931.87s]  So I'm probably going to end up roaming a lot this game.
[14932.67s -> 14934.51s]  This is a, this is going to be a game where I roam a ton.
[14949.02s -> 14952.46s]  We do have some good lanes to roam too, too. Like at roaming top and mid is both really good.
[14964.76s -> 14970.14s]  I just wanted to ward early, because I don't want to get shit on my way.
[14970.14s -> 14975.14s]  Okay, I'm just going to flash immediately.
[14975.14s -> 14981.14s]  There's no reason to not flash there because Alister used this flash to get my flash,
[14981.14s -> 14982.14s]  which is totally fine.
[14982.14s -> 14986.14s]  It's better for him because he has hex flash, but it's not that bad.
[14986.14s -> 14994.88s]  Because I can out-range him and I can stay away from his shit.
[14994.88s -> 14999.64s]  So we know he's in the bush, we just chill.
[14999.64s -> 15002.64s]  There it is. He fucked up. Now we go forward.
[15002.64s -> 15008.64s]  I don't know why Lux isn't throwing spells at this guy, like I don't know why she didn't cue him.
[15008.64s -> 15012.64s]  Like he fucked up, that the Alistair should have died there.
[15012.64s -> 15014.64s]  And she's pinging me, okay.
[15014.64s -> 15020.64s]  The Alistair should have died there. If Alistair ever fucked up and engaged like that, where he hex flashes in, gets stuck, like he was golden.
[15020.64s -> 15022.64s]  Yeah, I don't know why I was thrown this way I'm saying.
[15022.64s -> 15027.64s]  You don't throw spells that aren't going to land.
[15027.64s -> 15033.24s]  So there's no point in the box ever throwing her Q until Alistair fucks up the combo
[15033.88s -> 15038.60s]  Like she should have spoke with E and then um, because it's almost like a blood suck, right?
[15038.60s -> 15045.64s]  Think of it like a blood suck. If she throws the Q out right now, they have an opportunity to be aggressive because they know
[15046.12s -> 15048.12s]  They know the hook is down
[15048.68s -> 15052.12s]  So it's better for her to just hold the hook essentially, right?
[15053.48s -> 15058.84s]  Hold the Q and now when Alistair does go in they have to be nervous about that Q
[15059.08s -> 15064.12s]  Because they can't just think oh the queues down. Let's let's engage, right? So they can't actually think about that
[15064.88s -> 15066.88s]  This is why I don't like
[15071.35s -> 15081.13s]  A lot of the time doing this like push first the way if they can't engage on us without like flashing so it doesn't matter like luck
[15081.51s -> 15092.79s]  Did she queue the wave again or my an idiots like just oh man? I'm losing my mind here. Oh
[15093.43s -> 15097.87s]  These I'm I'm tilting it's fun. I need to not tilt. I need to just chill
[15097.87s -> 15104.03s]  But I'm getting frustrated because we're like not using cooldowns properly and it's driving me fucking crazy
[15107.58s -> 15111.30s]  Because these are very simple things to do you guys got to walk the way of any by the way
[15111.30s -> 15115.50s]  You can't let them freeze. Okay, there are simple things to do. I know I'm being annoying a shit
[15115.50s -> 15121.58s]  Winning about this, but this is stuff that you you need to be thinking about when you're playing the game. Well, you should actively be thinking
[15123.94s -> 15130.50s]  What can I do with my champions toolkit to stop their champions toolkit and you should be thinking okay
[15130.78s -> 15138.14s]  I have Q right? So what do they want to do? They want to go in okay? And when you're thinking they want to go in
[15141.12s -> 15146.64s]  Right you should be thinking okay when they go in I can just Q and that should be your entire thought process
[15147.68s -> 15149.68s]  Your thought process should never be oh
[15150.96s -> 15154.24s]  Maybe I can land a random Q at max range and we can get a kill
[15157.04s -> 15158.72s]  She killed the wave yes, that's what I mean like
[15159.84s -> 15163.52s]  You should never Q the wave on walks either unless you're going to a hundred percent reset
[15163.52s -> 15171.54s]  That would be like if I hooked the way of as like what's crank or some shit. Why is my locks bait pinging my graves?
[15172.18s -> 15175.70s]  Dude, I gotta keep this a hundred percent honest with you, man
[15177.50s -> 15180.94s]  You don't get you you don't get to be mad here
[15181.90s -> 15183.90s]  Why are these players are such babies?
[15187.48s -> 15196.03s]  Jesus Christ what pussy's man these people are such babies the graves played correctly by the way like a hundred percent
[15196.03s -> 15201.87s]  He's mad at the Graves for taking a wave. He wanted to not like he wanted to be able to
[15201.87s -> 15206.91s]  TP back and get the wave. That's what this lock is so trash that she actually believes
[15206.91s -> 15212.59s]  that's the Graves' fault that Graves misplayed by pushing the bot wave. But it was the right
[15212.59s -> 15218.35s]  play. Pushing the bot wave was the correct play there because then she doesn't have to TP.
[15218.35s -> 15222.67s]  The whole reason that he's pushing it is to save her teleport so that she doesn't have to TP
[15222.67s -> 15231.02s]  to win. Players like this are why the game is hard to play right now in the current meta.
[15231.58s -> 15236.86s]  Why it feels bad? Because this lock is trash. You guys can all see this lock is terrible.
[15236.86s -> 15240.78s]  She's already made a bunch of mistakes. She's blaming her team. She's being a dip-shet, right?
[15241.66s -> 15251.55s]  But she can climb up to this elo being this bad because of the system, the current system in
[15251.55s -> 15275.31s]  place. We should immediately do Baron here, Dragon. I mean, we should have this come.
[15275.31s -> 15278.31s]  You don't have time for this, just come to Dragon.
[15278.31s -> 15282.31s]  Bro, the least is to show top. We should be doing Dragon.
[15282.31s -> 15302.92s]  When this should happen, by the way, where you have enemy jungler shows on one side of the map,
[15302.92s -> 15307.92s]  you should always be playing on the other side of the map to make a counter play.
[15307.92s -> 15312.92s]  So, jungler shows on top side. We go for Dragon, right? Easy.
[15312.92s -> 15321.04s]  Yo, be careful. Alister is going to be there. Zareth is going to be there. Just leave.
[15321.04s -> 15327.17s]  Just leave, leave, leave, leave, I'll do it for you. I'll make you leave. I got you man.
[15329.68s -> 15332.88s]  But we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and
[15333.76s -> 15339.68s]  I need to back now, but we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and not only did their bot lane have to back, but
[15341.28s -> 15348.24s]  The enemy was top. I
[15348.24s -> 15350.72s]  I tried man. I tried to flash Q him
[15351.36s -> 15359.64s]  But yeah, it's it's really I don't know a lot of junglers don't and I don't think they know what they're oh, I'm dead by the way
[15359.64s -> 15362.64s]  I'm not even going to pop exhaust. I'm just dead.
[15363.64s -> 15368.64s]  I want to junglers don't know what the goal of the game actually is.
[15368.64s -> 15375.64s]  A lot of them think it's a bad insect, but a lot of junglers think the goal of the game is to get as much farm as you can and run over the enemy team and shit.
[15375.64s -> 15383.64s]  But it's actually it is, but it's also about getting early objectives and turning those small leads into big leads through objective control.
[15383.64s -> 15384.64s]  Right?
[15384.64s -> 15389.08s]  So like right now, I want to rotate top.
[15389.08s -> 15392.08s]  Rift is up. I know Lee Sin's gonna be on top side of the map right now.
[15392.08s -> 15397.08s]  I want to rotate top so that I can help my team by being in the top side of the map
[15397.08s -> 15399.08s]  because that's where the next play is gonna be made.
[15399.08s -> 15405.82s]  Well, the play is made mid, but I mean, I'm here, so it's fine.
[15405.82s -> 15414.38s]  Oh my god.
[15414.38s -> 15423.00s]  I did not think the fucking Lee Sin would be there too.
[15423.00s -> 15425.00s]  Oh, oops.
[15425.00s -> 15432.48s]  This is rough. I don't really know how to play this
[15432.48s -> 15436.34s]  Play this because I got there in time to counter the gank, right?
[15437.06s -> 15441.28s]  I exhaust that the guy saved the Xeroth. I got there in time to counter the gank, but
[15443.94s -> 15445.94s]  Oh, well played
[15446.74s -> 15449.24s]  Does actually mega well played
[15450.90s -> 15456.27s]  That was really good. I want to push this way then, but I can't
[15465.08s -> 15470.74s]  Like you guys are noticing there's no objectives taken on the map yet at 10 minutes, which is kind of crazy
[15470.74s -> 15475.38s]  The Alice is doing really good. The Alice is not a bad support player. He's playing well
[15475.86s -> 15497.62s]  Like he's playing very well a lot of this is more of like I need I don't have anything to do on the map because
[15498.54s -> 15501.58s]  I'm trying to help my jungler, but my jungler is trolling
[15502.54s -> 15504.54s]  It's really rough
[15504.94s -> 15508.54s]  Because like I'm trying to rotate over and help my jungler on cooldown basically right
[15508.90s -> 15521.69s]  But my jungler doesn't want to fight you see like I'm countering the Alice's fight or gangster. It's just I'm just dead
[15524.62s -> 15525.46s]  Dude.
[15527.46s -> 15529.62s]  Like, we shouldn't have made that play mid
[15529.62s -> 15531.46s]  because we knew that they were all there
[15531.46s -> 15533.90s]  and we knew that our junglers doing this.
[15535.14s -> 15537.38s]  This might just be a jungle diff, honestly.
[15539.10s -> 15540.14s]  Like, our AD carry sucks,
[15540.14s -> 15542.18s]  but it might just be a straight up jungle diff game.
[15542.18s -> 15543.06s]  They do happen.
[15543.06s -> 15544.90s]  Today, we need a different...
[15544.90s -> 15545.78s]  Especially in this era,
[15545.78s -> 15547.82s]  where jungle has so much control of the game,
[15547.82s -> 15553.24s]  they do happen.
[15553.24s -> 15554.88s]  It's a pretty big jungle diff chip hopping.
[15554.88s -> 15556.40s]  You know it, I know it.
[15556.40s -> 15562.90s]  But yeah, he's saying, yeah, he knows the jungle is getting out of class insanely hard
[15563.40s -> 15568.67s]  Because Graves counters Lee sin. It's a massive counter
[15569.35s -> 15573.37s]  But this guy doesn't know what he's doing
[15575.45s -> 15579.89s]  I think he's a Rengar one trick and Rengar got banned. I think that's what's going on
[15581.01s -> 15587.89s]  It's a Rengar one trick who got banned out and he tried to play a champion that requires thought not just the I jump you die champ
[15589.09s -> 15591.33s]  Right and he just gets shit on for it
[15596.96s -> 15599.38s]  I mean dude I can't even I can't even do anything this game
[15600.72s -> 15610.35s]  Our top winner is getting his ass whipped to it's really fucking rough. I mean he's in here. I'm pretty sure
[15610.91s -> 15612.91s]  It's not it was it was warded though
[15614.19s -> 15617.15s]  I mean we can't really do anything here. I'm dead. I think
[15618.03s -> 15620.03s]  Yeah, I'm just dead
[15620.27s -> 15624.27s]  This is just rough. I I kind of want to go next cuz I don't think I don't think I
[15625.19s -> 15627.43s]  Don't think we have the skill on the team to win
[15627.43s -> 15633.67s]  the jungle diff is huge the 80 diff is huge and I'm just I can't I can't
[15633.67s -> 15650.54s]  impact the map like I can't I just can't do anything this can to impact the map
[15650.54s -> 15668.22s]  and it feels really bad oh some of which I should have flashed I got like
[15668.22s -> 15670.38s]  pre-blocked a little bit when he knocked me and I like had to walk the
[15670.38s -> 15675.34s]  direction to splash up that's my man like what was that TP man oh god get me out
[15675.34s -> 15680.70s]  I'm gonna be a hundred percent real get me out that TP was miserable bad do
[15680.70s -> 15694.52s]  just TP to the wave. Like what does our blocks doing too? Like I just feel like
[15694.52s -> 15702.52s]  everybody's late to the fights. The Graves doesn't want to take fights, even though
[15702.52s -> 15707.72s]  he's playing Graves and W. Sin. Like I feel like this is rough, this is a rough game.
[15708.68s -> 15712.60s]  Games like this tilt me and I kind of just want to go next. Because games like this,
[15712.60s -> 15717.16s]  they are winnable, but I feel like I want to go next to save mental, you know? Like
[15717.16s -> 15730.84s]  Okay, I just want to save my mental because the oh, it's so gross
[15732.40s -> 15736.84s]  Like watching what locks did in the early stages of the lane phase just wasting our Q on repeat
[15737.00s -> 15741.56s]  That was one of the most embarrassing things ever and then like look at that. She just cute a minion
[15753.20s -> 15756.61s]  Oh
[15756.61s -> 15760.53s]  Bro like oh my god. You got a bunch of the way of men. Oh
[15764.41s -> 15768.68s]  We shits. I
[15768.68s -> 15776.98s]  Mean I can't even walk. Oh my god
[15776.98s -> 15781.98s]  I don't even have help from my fucking team.
[15781.98s -> 15784.98s]  That's the worst part about this.
[15784.98s -> 15787.98s]  Oh.
[15787.98s -> 15792.98s]  Dude, these games feel so unplayable, man.
[15792.98s -> 15797.98s]  Like, I don't know how else to say it except for it, they just feel miserable to play.
[15797.98s -> 15802.94s]  Like, I'm trying to focus on playing, like, improving myself.
[15802.94s -> 15806.94s]  But it's so hard to know how to improve in games where, like,
[15806.94s -> 15816.51s]  You genuinely just get no help.
[15816.51s -> 15819.51s]  My watch has been tilted since like minute two for some reason.
[15819.51s -> 15824.51s]  And my grave has been completely pathing wrong, doing wrong shit.
[15824.51s -> 15826.51s]  It's hard to know how to help.
[15826.51s -> 15827.51s]  Like I went mid to help.
[15827.51s -> 15829.51s]  Counter two of the early ganks.
[15829.51s -> 15831.51s]  Lux still grief to the game.
[15831.51s -> 15835.08s]  So like, yeah, it's just it's hard to know.
[15835.08s -> 15837.08s]  And then top lane wasks.
[15837.08s -> 15841.48s]  It's so rough, man.
[15841.48s -> 15848.35s]  Like I'm gonna keep it 100% honest with you.
[15848.35s -> 15852.75s]  If you are a one trick, do not try and play other champs.
[15852.75s -> 15858.82s]  You will int.
[15858.82s -> 15862.66s]  You will play badly always and you will int and you will,
[15862.66s -> 15864.38s]  you will, like look at this.
[15864.38s -> 15866.98s]  This is 2.9K damage.
[15866.98s -> 15873.82s]  As I'm, they're like, what are we doing?
[15873.82s -> 15875.74s]  How are these people getting into this elo?
[15876.74s -> 15880.50s]  How does this locks like in the game?
[15880.50s -> 15885.50s]  She was against an Alistair bot and she did 1.9K damage in a,
[15886.90s -> 15890.90s]  16-minute game against a melee heavy team.
[15892.26s -> 15893.90s]  Like, what is this? What is happening?
[15895.30s -> 15901.53s]  This guy was D4 30 LP last season,
[15901.53s -> 15908.27s]  and now he's magically in masters?
[15908.27s -> 15910.55s]  No, we need to fix matchmaking.
[15910.55s -> 15917.34s]  This is insane.
[15917.34s -> 15918.82s]  Like, this is just a matchmaking diff.
[15918.82s -> 15919.82s]  It's nothing else.
[15920.82s -> 15925.82s]  My man literally does not belong in master tier 400 LP MMR,
[15925.82s -> 15944.68s]  at all. Why you can see that he's not at this level. Dude, I have the
[15944.68s -> 15957.37s]  walks player on my team again. Oh, there's a Xeroath one trick and a
[15957.37s -> 15964.65s]  Ranger one trick on the enemy team. I don't know, man. I guess I care
[15964.65s -> 15983.53s]  more about the Ranger than the Xeroath, but this is rough. Oh, what's up
[15983.53s -> 15986.97s]  to your Poppy? Dude, sorry. I hit, yes, on that man. I know the game
[15986.97s -> 15990.57s]  was winnable. I'm gonna be real. But dude, you didn't see what I saw
[15990.57s -> 15993.21s]  during the early game of that game, Chupabi.
[15993.21s -> 15999.66s]  Like man, the entire early game of that game was like,
[15999.66s -> 16004.76s]  we lost lane because Lux wouldn't use her Q
[16004.76s -> 16006.12s]  to fight the Alistair.
[16006.12s -> 16008.24s]  She was using it to farm minions.
[16009.36s -> 16011.40s]  Like she was so scared of being engaged
[16011.40s -> 16013.56s]  on by the Alistair and the Colesta,
[16013.56s -> 16017.84s]  that she would use her Q to max range farm minions.
[16017.84s -> 16020.12s]  Instead of save it, so when the Alistair engages,
[16020.12s -> 16021.12s]  we just kill him.
[16022.52s -> 16026.36s]  Right? Because if I was to ever engage us on me and looks, he just gets killed.
[16026.36s -> 16030.12s]  We just bind him, walk away, and he's stuck there, and he dies, right?
[16030.12s -> 16036.20s]  But for some reason, she didn't understand how to do that, so she was just throwing it to
[16036.20s -> 16040.60s]  farm, so we were just getting gaged on. So I started roaming. And every time I was like
[16040.60s -> 16045.96s]  roaming to an objective or something, the graves would always walk away and not fight.
[16045.96s -> 16049.88s]  Like he wasn't attempting to fight, he was basically just like, oh, I'm going to go farm some more.
[16049.88s -> 16052.60s]  But I'm like, dude, you can't do that. Like, if the owester's ganking me,
[16052.60s -> 16058.12s]  I'm countering mid. You can't just farm farm before coming mid or you can't just like not take dragon and chilling that right
[16058.12s -> 16064.00s]  Like it blows my mind that these players can get like it's like this guy too same thing like that jungler last game
[16064.84s -> 16068.68s]  Look at this it's the same thing as the last game like any is riddled with this shit
[16068.68s -> 16072.20s]  It's so miserable to play look at this this jungler last game, right?
[16072.36s -> 16074.52s]  He's not he's what like a D1 player, right?
[16074.52s -> 16077.96s]  He's not a bad player. He beats D1, but why is this guy in this game now?
[16077.96s -> 16084.44s]  He like art officially inflated to the sea low getting lucky with his first few games and now we have to play with this guy
[16084.44s -> 16093.19s]  Oh, it's in a count share the person it's a different player look on the account
[16094.87s -> 16098.84s]  D flash F flash so
[16099.48s -> 16102.79s]  It's a fucking account share
[16102.79s -> 16111.86s]  That's that's frustrating
[16111.86s -> 16114.98s]  Sorry for winding so much guys this shit's just really frustrating to me
[16114.98s -> 16122.98s]  But I know I should play it to like specifically only care about like improving and then while you're improving you'll climb automatically and shit.
[16122.98s -> 16130.98s]  But it's really frustrating when like the players in the game would rather be idiots and assholes to each other than play the game.
[16130.98s -> 16137.98s]  Right, like the game before the amumu move right the game before this the amumu was sping talk to the whole game and entered the winaway.
[16137.98s -> 16142.98s]  The last game the locks and the graves were being talked to each other the whole game we entered the game away.
[16142.98s -> 16151.40s]  It's like it's it's it's not fun to lose because one player gets mad at another player over them both being idiots
[16151.40s -> 16160.95s]  I'm sorry. It's not fun. It's so unfun. But we'll try and we'll try and win this one.
[16160.95s -> 16194.70s]  All we can really do is try and carry the games, right? It's about it. What is? What? What, man? What? What do you think they're gonna do to me?
[16194.70s -> 16198.14s]  Welcome to the league of you think it for the seven months man
[16198.14s -> 16202.00s]  What about happy path? I really don't want to meet all I don't I don't I don't want to meet all
[16202.54s -> 16218.41s]  Because like I I want to like value the penguins and shit, but dude if they walk up. I'm gonna flank them
[16219.05s -> 16221.05s]  That's what I'm standing here. Okay there in the main
[16253.12s -> 16257.20s]  That's a big cue. I need to get level two first here 100%
[16276.25s -> 16278.25s]  Should have just been autoing there that whole time
[16279.93s -> 16282.89s]  Because we have heel so she should have just walked up an autoed
[16282.89s -> 16288.97s]  As soon as this is what I mean by tracking cooldowns, as soon as the Nico missed her,
[16288.97s -> 16293.37s]  as soon as the Nico missed her cooldown, as soon as she missed her E, the Ash should have
[16293.37s -> 16298.73s]  just walked up and immediately started fighting. Right, like because they can no longer kill us,
[16301.03s -> 16306.71s]  the Nico doesn't actually have spells outside of her E, right? So if she misses that snare,
[16306.71s -> 16311.11s]  and she used her W2, right? So it's like, we just go ham. You don't need to be too scared.
[16311.11s -> 16317.19s]  It happens quite a bit sometimes where people will just be like really nervous
[16335.10s -> 16338.62s]  Damn if I had dodge that cue, I actually would have killed all three
[16339.30s -> 16340.30s]  Damn
[16340.30s -> 16345.18s]  I don't know if it was worth the flash after the guy. I actually I think it was if I had dodged the cue. I wouldn't have been fine
[16346.14s -> 16347.90s]  So that was that it's whatever
[16347.90s -> 16350.62s]  I've also done some misamy creeps here
[16350.86s -> 16359.35s]  So it's not the end of the world like I'm pretty sure Lisa did not have his top camps by the way
[16366.59s -> 16369.27s]  Damn if I was a little better mechanically I turned that by the way
[16370.23s -> 16400.20s]  100%. We should push this wave so that I can go get vision. Is yeah, that guy can't freeze that wave, so
[16403.38s -> 16431.91s]  sounds good. We send top. You can kind of see some really good. What is this?
[16432.95s -> 16468.68s]  Why's my cart this AFK turret? What is happening right now? Why was he AFK? I mean, I guess it worked out, but yeah, maybe I'd
[16468.68s -> 16483.72s]  to go what is cat-out. I don't know, happens. We do their bot lane is not very good. They're trying
[16483.72s -> 16491.86s]  to hard to force fights that they can't win. They genuinely can't win half of these fights
[16491.86s -> 16496.34s]  that they're trying to force. Maybe if they were against people who don't push their buttons,
[16496.34s -> 16499.70s]  they could win those, but it's like all I have to do is stand there and fight back and they was
[16500.74s -> 16504.50s]  they're on dragon, not thousand percent right now. There's not a lot I can do about that.
[16504.50s -> 16512.26s]  We just have to chill. There's almost nothing I can do about it. Kai says trying to fake act like she's big, but it's
[16515.73s -> 16517.73s]  There's just nothing we can do
[16519.22s -> 16529.13s]  Because our card this is top so we just chill. I finished the chair of us. No, no, no, not yet.
[16530.57s -> 16535.33s]  Whoa, we said it could be bot right now
[16537.45s -> 16541.85s]  I don't think it's too bad if he's bot though. They can't really die of us, especially with card the salts
[16541.85s -> 16559.28s]  Why is my ash just run?
[16559.28s -> 16566.66s]  She like just straight up runs away.
[16566.66s -> 16568.66s]  It's kind of silly.
[16568.66s -> 16578.70s]  Because we have we have card this ulti.
[16578.70s -> 16579.70s]  Like we can win a fight.
[16579.70s -> 16581.70s]  We can win a fight bot right now.
[16581.70s -> 16587.80s]  I guess I guess I'm just going to have to get them low enough for
[16587.80s -> 16589.80s]  card this to kill them.
[16589.80s -> 16592.80s]  Without the ash is help.
[16592.80s -> 16594.80s]  Which I think I can do.
[16594.80s -> 16595.80s]  It's not too bad.
[16595.80s -> 16598.11s]  Okay.
[16598.11s -> 16600.11s]  The call is coming bot.
[16600.11s -> 16601.11s]  We just killed them.
[16601.11s -> 16612.82s]  I don't know why we just asher honestly
[16612.82s -> 16616.14s]  Just asher room
[16616.14s -> 16622.97s]  Okay, that was pretty bad asher but
[16622.97s -> 16631.46s]  Filled
[16631.46s -> 16633.46s]  Uh, I don't think he's filled I think he's just having a bad game
[16635.46s -> 16637.46s]  I think it happens, you know
[16637.46s -> 16639.46s]  Whoa, okay
[16639.46s -> 16644.38s]  Do it, ult me, I fucking dare you
[16644.38s -> 16650.12s]  I'm trying to keep some mana
[16650.12s -> 16652.12s]  So that I can ulti
[16652.12s -> 16668.02s]  Oh, Karthas are to use the ult's
[16668.02s -> 16669.02s]  Fuck
[16669.02s -> 16684.14s]  They both backed there. Wow my bad. I honestly didn't think they were both gonna back there
[16684.82s -> 16689.56s]  Like I thought the Kai's so was gonna back right where I saw her my glass
[16690.60s -> 16692.60s]  That's my bad
[16692.60s -> 16694.60s]  I should be
[16694.60s -> 16696.60s]  I think we send can come bot here and kill me
[16699.74s -> 16701.74s]  I should actually stop this guy's back
[16702.06s -> 16712.27s]  Yeah, I should stop his back because it's more value to stop the back now even if we send isn't bot, it's more value
[16713.55s -> 16715.55s]  Cuz he's so low
[16716.71s -> 16718.91s]  Cally is me, I don't know, so we gotta be care.
[16720.91s -> 16723.71s]  I wasted my ult though, which makes me kind of scared.
[16724.31s -> 16727.11s]  The other thing that kind of sucks about this is we don't have good vision.
[16734.09s -> 16737.69s]  And I can't really help anybody on the map because the same thing is happening as before.
[16738.89s -> 16741.89s]  Or like we're missing opportunities to get kills on timers.
[16745.22s -> 16747.02s]  I mean, the dog lighting guy is playing fine with him.
[16747.42s -> 16748.42s]  I think he's trolled a lot.
[16748.52s -> 16751.22s]  Like he's he's trolling. This isn't like his best game.
[16751.22s -> 16753.22s]  and
[16753.22s -> 16757.22s]  but it's also I don't know why we're getting so tilted around the map right now
[16757.22s -> 16761.22s]  because if I'm if I'm being honest we should just win the game often like
[16761.22s -> 16763.22s]  being better players
[16763.22s -> 16780.49s]  I don't know what this car this is thinking but
[16780.49s -> 16781.49s]  do it do it do it
[16781.49s -> 16784.49s]  hard this we can fight we can fight just fight
[16784.49s -> 16788.82s]  bro what are we doing
[16788.82s -> 16791.82s]  I'm losing it man
[16791.82s -> 16793.82s]  ah nonanah I'm tilted
[16793.82s -> 16795.82s]  I'm tilted as fuck he didn't walk in
[16795.82s -> 16799.06s]  Just go on to the a cally shroud, man.
[16800.42s -> 16804.42s]  I just walk a foot to your right and stand on the a cally shroud.
[16804.42s -> 16808.82s]  She just eats your damage, like while she's in the shroud, she can't stop that.
[16812.85s -> 16814.85s]  Holy shit, I'm losing my mind.
[16816.82s -> 16821.22s]  Like, Ash is just inting bot waves right now, not trying to do anything.
[16822.22s -> 16826.82s]  Watch this really far up on CS, which is really good, but I'm losing it, man.
[16826.82s -> 16830.82s]  Like we see exactly where they are every game.
[16830.82s -> 16833.82s]  Like we see where everybody is on the enemy team permanently
[16833.82s -> 16836.82s]  and we still can't manage to like walk to the right location.
[16836.82s -> 16841.84s]  This is driving me crazy.
[16841.84s -> 16845.84s]  My my car this 80 my car this jungle is getting out formed
[16845.84s -> 16848.84s]  like a car this jungle is getting out formed by a leasing jungle.
[16848.84s -> 16850.84s]  That's insane.
[16850.84s -> 16854.84s]  Like I don't think I don't think I can stress enough how crazy that is.
[16854.84s -> 16860.98s]  Well, you should never be a world where car this ever gets out farms.
[16860.98s -> 16867.11s]  No way.
[16867.11s -> 16868.11s]  I'm dead.
[16868.11s -> 16871.11s]  Dude, no way, I just fucking ate the end of that.
[16871.11s -> 16873.11s]  Now I'm playing that.
[16873.11s -> 16874.11s]  Just kill the least.
[16874.11s -> 16875.11s]  Send, man.
[16875.11s -> 16886.34s]  I fucked up there.
[16886.34s -> 16889.34s]  That was my fault because I got hit by the tip of the...
[16889.34s -> 16890.34s]  That was my fault.
[16890.34s -> 16894.34s]  I got barely equipped by the tip of the Nico Altz when I was trying to space because I'm bad.
[16894.34s -> 16898.34s]  And if I was alive there and I could have saved my flash for the least in queue, we just went.
[16898.34s -> 16905.25s]  Thank you we just win. I am confused at why we decided to like not fight that immediately though
[16906.35s -> 16909.83s]  Like we caught out to their members and we just got scared for whatever reason
[16910.43s -> 16912.43s]  Wait, we win this fight
[16912.43s -> 16914.29s]  With the 1000% win this fight this fight this fight this
[16928.68s -> 16934.60s]  Bro, do not throw a fucking temper tantrum right now. There's one kill. Do not throw a temper tantrum
[16938.13s -> 16939.81s]  Oh my god, here we go. I
[16940.53s -> 16942.77s]  Took one kill the guys about the losing mind guys
[16942.77s -> 16954.94s]  because I need to mute all, I'm gonna mute all in a second.
[16956.14s -> 16961.50s]  Like, I can't, to what these people are, I know.
[16961.50s -> 16963.82s]  Like, I can't, to men, you people are disgusting.
[16965.10s -> 16966.90s]  Like, you guys just,
[16966.90s -> 16968.62s]  wine, you play bad, you wine,
[16968.62s -> 16970.34s]  and you bitch about every little mistake
[16970.34s -> 16971.82s]  that everything happens.
[16971.82s -> 16973.62s]  Even though it's like in the middle of a fight,
[16973.62s -> 16975.62s]  I guarantee I'm a better player than you are,
[16975.62s -> 16978.26s]  and you're still winding and crying over one shutdown
[16978.26s -> 16981.82s]  that like, you didn't even walk to until I spam pinged you.
[16981.82s -> 16988.49s]  Like I literally won't be to them, you hit one E, and then you're mad.
[16988.49s -> 16995.87s]  Dude, I swear League players are fucking psychopaths.
[16995.87s -> 16999.31s]  At least I got the exhaust off, surely she dies, right?
[16999.31s -> 17001.95s]  Surely she dies there, or not.
[17001.95s -> 17003.75s]  Okay.
[17003.75s -> 17004.71s]  Okay, at least she died.
[17006.39s -> 17007.55s]  Help each other guys.
[17008.99s -> 17012.80s]  Help each other teamwork?
[17012.80s -> 17014.24s]  teamwork, teamwork, teamwork.
[17014.24s -> 17019.91s]  Teamwork.
[17019.91s -> 17026.81s]  Wait, this Ash isn't saying, okay, I'm not gonna lie.
[17026.81s -> 17029.37s]  That ash played that so good.
[17029.37s -> 17031.53s]  I only saw the end of it and she still played that good.
[17032.89s -> 17033.73s]  That was sick.
[17035.37s -> 17036.53s]  Well done.
[17036.53s -> 17040.30s]  That was actually really good.
[17040.30s -> 17041.62s]  She almost stopped the dive.
[17042.62s -> 17047.94s]  That's crazy.
[17047.94s -> 17051.70s]  This game is definitely 1,000% still winable, though.
[17051.70s -> 17054.62s]  We just have to play four late game
[17054.62s -> 17056.62s]  and not lose our fucking minds.
[17056.62s -> 17058.06s]  I'll let that push back into my ash.
[17058.06s -> 17062.66s]  I'll go mid, get some vision.
[17062.66s -> 17063.82s]  That's pretty much all we have to do.
[17064.78s -> 17075.42s]  Quite for late and not lose our mind early. We could play to kill this a call. You're right now. She doesn't know there's no word here
[17076.82s -> 17082.97s]  We could also invade here. Oh, that's so unlucky
[17084.37s -> 17114.50s]  That was such a close queue kill that guy Jesus Christ
[17119.53s -> 17121.13s]  I feel like we should have won that fight. I
[17122.01s -> 17124.01s]  Feel like something awkward happened and we lost
[17124.81s -> 17131.61s]  Did my ash just walk directly into this a cally and not use her ulti use your ulti you have ulti use your ulti
[17132.25s -> 17146.51s]  Oh, oh my god. What the fuck? Oh, oh, oh my god
[17148.51s -> 17152.47s]  I don't even know what to say right now. This is insane
[17154.23s -> 17159.27s]  This genuinely feels like everybody in the game is losing their mind in the freeest game I've ever seen in my life
[17163.60s -> 17171.48s]  Like that's what we're losing to right there that guy the guy who like doesn't understand how sent a works like that player
[17171.76s -> 17174.24s]  That's why I'm frustrated like that player right there
[17174.76s -> 17180.76s]  has no idea how center works tries to fight me and we're like losing to that guy
[17180.76s -> 17185.76s]  I'm trying really hard not to be an asshole, but like it's flooding out right now from these games
[17187.76s -> 17197.24s]  It's crazy, but he's so toxic. Look at this he went proto belt Ionia boot
[17199.74s -> 17221.38s]  Nico, but like what that doesn't do anything to help his team you could arrow that guy. I mean, it's not impossible
[17222.68s -> 17248.49s]  or don't, that's fine, oh my god, guys, I think my locks is a okay, she's been
[17248.49s -> 17259.13s]  sitting in base for like five minutes, I think she's like, literally just
[17259.13s -> 17274.90s]  throwing or some hits, let's push the Swift, we could make a pick right now,
[17274.90s -> 17286.25s]  Jacks, what are you doing man? Why are you up there? Oh no, also why does
[17286.25s -> 17298.62s]  Sasha have the worst build I've ever seen dude if we lose to the kaisa that just did that I'm gonna lose my mind
[17314.82s -> 17318.58s]  Wait that guy just blind art in without any vision of anybody and just died
[17319.42s -> 17321.42s]  There's no way we can lose this
[17321.58s -> 17326.24s]  We got this guys just play
[17326.60s -> 17332.27s]  Like I just need to I need help getting vision control on barren and
[17332.91s -> 17384.57s]  Mid and then we can we can win we got this right now. I
[17384.57s -> 17422.30s]  I mean we still got Baron, but he did get two of them I guess or no only yeah you got
[17422.30s -> 17434.95s]  Cardus and Ash. But we did get Baron which is very nice. I'm gonna go Dom's this game.
[17434.95s -> 17457.36s]  I'm gonna go Black Cleaver, but I think I'm gonna go Dom's. I need to get Vision Control on Dragon and Min.
[17457.36s -> 17475.41s]  I need to get Vision Control and I need help to do it though. I'm gonna act like I'm
[17475.41s -> 17486.58s]  back in here. We should just be pushing mid with Baron. I don't know what we're doing.
[17488.34s -> 17491.30s]  Like, like, Loki, it should just be straight up like we go mid with Baron here.
[17503.01s -> 17523.94s]  The fuck was that? That was a terrible play. Guys, just come mid, we have Baron.
[17533.92s -> 17538.56s]  Nice, huge peck. Pushmen, pushmen. Fuck dragon, just pushmen.
[17545.78s -> 17559.08s]  Okay, now we back off. Oh, I mean, that was bad. Guys, back off, back off, back off,
[17559.08s -> 17573.48s]  Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, guys, you can leave, you can leave, we just go to Dragon, please.
[17573.48s -> 17579.48s]  We still have so much gold to get on the map, we can go get bot to your two, bot to your one, bot to your two.
[17579.48s -> 17584.48s]  We have so much gold to get on the map, it's not a big deal, right? Like, we don't need to end the game right the second.
[17584.48s -> 17619.88s]  We actually have cartas, and we have jacks too, so like our scaling is really good.
[17619.88s -> 17636.30s]  I need to go get I need to go get my next item but I need enough gold to do it
[17638.86s -> 17644.54s]  I also need to go get wards the sucks. I'm gonna like a weird buy timer where I guy don't have enough things to get
[17645.26s -> 17647.26s]  You know what I'm just gonna get my ward item
[17648.22s -> 17651.10s]  I'm gonna grab this for now just so we can actually get some power on the map
[17651.98s -> 17656.86s]  Because the map's so dark and I think getting the ward item before finishing my last whisper items is probably the smartest call
[17656.86s -> 17666.62s]  I am a little concerned why we're not pushing bot with jacks. We're pushing top
[17668.36s -> 17670.00s]  And I'm also concerned why we're not
[17671.00s -> 17674.28s]  Playing for mid prior and we're just farming bot side
[17675.80s -> 17677.80s]  This is such an awkward fucking thing
[17678.60s -> 17690.36s]  We should just be playing for mid prior and use a erodangage. That's how we win. We just use a erodangage when they contest mid
[17691.20s -> 17699.38s]  It's actually that easy
[17699.38s -> 17718.67s]  Like, okay, it's actually that easy. See? Watch now. This guy's dead. I mean, that's fine with me
[17720.27s -> 17722.35s]  You guys want to take care of me. That's totally fine
[17723.39s -> 17741.04s]  They can get the inhib and then they can back up. Yeah, yeah getting hit back up and
[17742.12s -> 17751.24s]  Then play for play for Baron. They'll only have a few seconds to do this though, so it's kind of scary because these two are gonna be alive
[17757.25s -> 17759.25s]  They need to back immediately
[17759.25s -> 17765.65s]  There's a reset. You don't need the way. Just leave.
[17765.65s -> 17766.61s]  We've, we've,
[17766.61s -> 17769.25s]  barons up, barons up. Think about the macro guys, the macro.
[17769.25s -> 17771.49s]  We play for barons now.
[17771.49s -> 17775.64s]  Because there's a timer now where, like,
[17775.64s -> 17777.08s]  you guys just need to reset.
[17777.08s -> 17780.44s]  Because there's a timer where the enemy has tempo on the map.
[17780.44s -> 17784.68s]  And if we don't, uh, if we don't allow,
[17784.68s -> 17787.64s]  if, if we don't reset, they'll just rush barons,
[17787.64s -> 17789.08s]  and there's nothing we can do about it.
[17789.08s -> 17801.19s]  Okay, they're not on baron. I think they missed their timer.
[17801.19s -> 17803.51s]  They're on it. No, they're on it. They're on it.
[17803.51s -> 17814.99s]  Okay, they're not on it, we're fun. We can still fight this though, but we need everybody here
[17815.65s -> 17826.94s]  Just arrow arrow arrow arrow arrow arrow arrow it doesn't matter if you hit mouth just arrow
[17827.52s -> 17829.76s]  Just arrow him. Thank you
[17830.72s -> 17838.00s]  No, no guys the back line the back line
[17840.90s -> 17845.76s]  Play together play together. Yes, nice
[17848.72s -> 17853.29s]  End of the game you end you end here
[17853.29s -> 17855.53s]  Walks, don't back.
[17855.53s -> 17857.81s]  You are giving me cancer.
[17857.81s -> 17859.09s]  Okay, they forfeit it.
[17859.09s -> 17861.05s]  Dude, look how easy that is.
[17861.05s -> 17862.85s]  Look how easy it is to win games
[17862.85s -> 17864.89s]  when people are listening to macro.
[17864.89s -> 17866.13s]  Look how easy it is.
[17866.13s -> 17867.73s]  Oh my god.
[17869.33s -> 17870.33s]  I'm losing it man.
[17870.33s -> 17872.05s]  I swear to God, I'm losing my hair.
[17872.05s -> 17873.65s]  I can feel my hair falling out right now.
[17873.65s -> 17876.17s]  I can feel it falling out of my fucking head.
[17876.17s -> 17877.93s]  Like I just lost the one that's right there.
[17877.93s -> 17882.37s]  Like it's just fucking killing me, Beth.
[17882.37s -> 17885.93s]  In game, God, it's so hard.
[17885.93s -> 17888.57s]  I feel so exhausted.
[17888.57s -> 17895.20s]  Like it's so exhausting.
[17895.20s -> 17896.56s]  You played a 44 minute gold game?
[17896.56s -> 17903.64s]  God damn, that's impressive.
[17903.64s -> 17905.80s]  I don't wanna honor any of these people.
[17905.80s -> 17906.96s]  Who would you guys honor?
[17907.96s -> 17909.40s]  Like out of all of them, who would you guys pick?
[17909.40s -> 17910.80s]  Because I don't know, they all suck.
[17910.80s -> 17916.32s]  In my eyes, I'm too toxic right now, they all suck.
[17916.32s -> 17920.23s]  Jacks, all right, I'll give it to Jacks.
[17920.23s -> 17922.27s]  Ash, Ash was trying, I'll give you that.
[17922.27s -> 17926.92s]  Ash was trying.
[17926.92s -> 17928.26s]  Dude, look at this lux.
[17929.36s -> 17939.95s]  This lux got so fucking carried, oh my god.
[17941.15s -> 17948.95s]  Don't type to me, you pedestrian.
[17948.95s -> 17959.28s]  Smink all of them up a pedestrian.
[17959.28s -> 17961.88s]  That's not even insults.
[17961.88s -> 17965.56s]  Like, oh yeah, yeah, wow, fucking pedestrian,
[17965.56s -> 17987.96s]  like, this is not even an insult man.
[17987.96s -> 17988.68s]  There it is.
[17988.68s -> 17993.68s]  guys, I feel like part of my life gets taken away, you know?
[17993.68s -> 17998.48s]  Like when I play in my mannequin, I'm like super sweaty, try harding and shit.
[17998.48s -> 18003.24s]  I feel like I'm losing, like, yeah, it's like every time I lose, it's like one hair.
[18003.24s -> 18005.52s]  Or like every time I'm like barely win, right?
[18005.52s -> 18009.72s]  It's just like every game in this yellow is like one hair on my head gets fucking burnt
[18009.72s -> 18011.12s]  out and it just leaves.
[18011.12s -> 18032.75s]  And I'm not like, I'm gonna be like a Homer Simpson.
[18032.75s -> 18035.23s]  Like look at the difference in wards placed.
[18035.23s -> 18038.71s]  This is what annoys me about bad support players.
[18038.71s -> 18041.51s]  This guy plays 23.
[18041.51s -> 18051.30s]  He's more focused on getting kills than placing wards, and it's really stupid.
[18051.30s -> 18055.22s]  Sorry, I just don't, I don't have anything against the dog lightning guy, as a person,
[18055.22s -> 18058.58s]  other than like, what I've seen on his stream, right?
[18058.58s -> 18063.42s]  Like on his stream, he just seems really ego-tistical.
[18063.42s -> 18067.02s]  Like he's like everything I hate in the average league player.
[18067.02s -> 18074.02s]  He has a massive ego because he reached Challenger on the support roll on an off-met-a-pick
[18074.02s -> 18078.14s]  like last year at some point or maybe he's Challenger right now, I don't even know.
[18078.14s -> 18080.82s]  Maybe he has an account in Challenger, I don't even know.
[18080.82s -> 18087.52s]  But it drives me crazy because he doesn't do anything correctly.
[18087.52s -> 18093.04s]  He gets away with such dumb shit because he like basically wins lane because he plays
[18093.04s -> 18095.20s]  extremely aggressively.
[18095.20s -> 18100.00s]  But if you guys noticed in that game, the reason we won the lane or we were at the pushback
[18100.00s -> 18104.80s]  is because they played aggressively, but they did it really stupidly.
[18104.80s -> 18107.80s]  They were fighting us in our own waves.
[18107.80s -> 18110.44s]  On repeat, they were just fighting us in our own waves.
[18110.44s -> 18114.80s]  Every time I would just turn a 1 for 1, almost the 1 for 2 every time.
[18114.80s -> 18118.40s]  It's stupid because every time that's happening, they're also giving me souls.
[18118.40s -> 18120.40s]  Even like take weird fights.
[18120.40s -> 18124.00s]  I know he's probably 4 fun, he doesn't care, he's a smart blah blah blah.
[18124.00s -> 18129.92s]  I just don't like when people like that, like ego, they're ass off when they place so badly.
[18129.92s -> 18135.45s]  It drives me crazy.
[18135.45s -> 18136.45s]  Why do I care so much?
[18136.45s -> 18138.09s]  I don't know.
[18138.09s -> 18159.48s]  I don't know.
[18159.48s -> 18161.60s]  How are you guys doing, by the way?
[18161.60s -> 18163.08s]  How's the number is day going in chat?
[18163.08s -> 18163.92s]  What do you guys up to?
[18163.92s -> 18165.32s]  Talk to me.
[18165.32s -> 18168.16s]  I know I stopped like teaching the game and started the mining.
[18168.16s -> 18171.36s]  Like I got on my main account a few hours ago, and I stopped teaching and I started
[18171.36s -> 18172.20s]  the mining a bunch.
[18172.20s -> 18178.59s]  So, my bad.
[18178.59s -> 18180.43s]  My bad on that one, dude.
[18180.43s -> 18181.43s]  How are you guys doing though?
[18181.43s -> 18189.60s]  How's everybody's dig on?
[18189.60s -> 18191.00s]  When is the coaching surface open?
[18191.00s -> 18195.12s]  Oh, I could probably do coaching at some point soon.
[18196.16s -> 18198.40s]  Like, I'd be willing to do some coaching.
[18198.40s -> 18200.72s]  So my sub coaching or something or like,
[18200.72s -> 18211.94s]  something like that, it might be fun.
[18211.94s -> 18213.18s]  So I mean, bronze, you don't get enough time
[18213.18s -> 18214.02s]  to actually improve.
[18214.02s -> 18216.06s]  Dude, I feel that man, it takes a long time.
[18216.06s -> 18219.98s]  What he does not an easy game to pick up and start playing, right?
[18219.98s -> 18221.74s]  Like, if you're in bronze or silver and you're like,
[18221.74s -> 18223.62s]  oh, I actually, you know, I'm having fun playing the game.
[18223.62s -> 18225.26s]  I kind of want to try and get better.
[18225.26s -> 18231.50s]  It's you're just overwhelmed with so much info that you like have to play so many games right like I feel you man
[18235.29s -> 18257.36s]  Like it's it's overwhelming. Yeah, I I feel you well we got mid. Okay
[18259.44s -> 18270.62s]  Just by trust well more if I pick trust that we won't have AP but I also think I'm better at trust than I am at like other stuff
[18270.62s -> 18285.05s]  So I don't know, AP vs. I'm not good enough at AP vs. Man, I'm gonna be real.
[18285.05s -> 18291.26s]  Well, my mouse is good, but the problem with mouse is like, mouse is a shitty champion.
[18291.26s -> 18293.26s]  Like, mouse is trash, right?
[18293.26s -> 18300.26s]  So like, he's good, but he's like not good in the sense of like, I can play him well.
[18300.26s -> 18306.26s]  But at the end of the day, if they pick something that like, counters mouse, I just lose.
[18306.26s -> 18311.12s]  Or is like Tristana's just free to pick?
[18311.12s -> 18316.32s]  Like, even if we play all AD, right, let's say we do all AD or some shit, like, on
[18316.32s -> 18318.96s]  accidents or because people are one-tracks blah blah blah.
[18318.96s -> 18320.40s]  It's still free.
[18320.40s -> 18322.56s]  Like Tristana's still like a good pick.
[18322.56s -> 18326.64s]  Because even with all AD, she's still like, you can build Lord Dom's.
[18326.64s -> 18330.24s]  She has incredibly high pressure, or my game, if you play her right, right,
[18330.24s -> 18332.08s]  like you could push the waves, Rome.
[18332.08s -> 18336.08s]  You can, you can roam top, roam, bot, help lanes out, like level two, three, you can
[18336.08s -> 18337.76s]  and invade jungler, certainly.
[18337.76s -> 18341.83s]  Like she's just incredibly, incredibly strong.
[18341.83s -> 18342.91s]  This guy should go Pike.
[18344.27s -> 18347.55s]  I was gonna say they picked Nunu and I picked an 80 mid.
[18347.55s -> 18350.51s]  They picked Nunu and Thresh.
[18350.51s -> 18352.51s]  We should have an engage.
[18352.51s -> 18354.55s]  Cause Pike, Trist.
[18354.55s -> 18356.71s]  Like I can just walk bot on repeat now
[18356.71s -> 18368.04s]  and pretty much kill people.
[18368.04s -> 18369.04s]  Watch an Iron Game.
[18369.04s -> 18370.12s]  Watching an Iron Game.
[18370.12s -> 18371.80s]  I feel like it wouldn't be an actual Iron Game, though.
[18371.80s -> 18375.81s]  What up?
[18375.81s -> 18378.53s]  I've heard I had friends who like intentionally lost
[18378.53s -> 18380.41s]  a bunch of games.
[18380.41s -> 18388.89s]  Uh, and so they can get to iron four right they like they like into down that tie and four whatever to see if they could make it and
[18390.85s -> 18399.09s]  Uh, there's just so many like smurfs in iron. There's like legitimate bot bot accounts.
[18400.77s -> 18407.53s]  Like like accounts that are like being boughted right there's like boughted accounts and iron. There's like smurfs all over the place.
[18407.53s -> 18420.04s]  It seems so stops. I wonder if Riot like did something that stopped the bots?
[18421.40s -> 18425.56s]  They must they may have like they may have just been incorporated something that like stops the software
[18426.04s -> 18435.72s]  But I don't know. I haven't heard anything about it, but I have no clear. I'll be real. I don't know
[18436.12s -> 18461.87s]  You have to take fall you were a last game. I got boots one
[18463.55s -> 18472.67s]  Dude, that sounds awful. I kind of feel bad for actual iron players who are like
[18472.67s -> 18492.80s]  Like, in Iron trying to climb because like, that sounds bad.
[18492.80s -> 18495.80s]  I do think you can climb obviously out of any yellow, it doesn't matter, right?
[18495.80s -> 18497.10s]  Like if I were to go into an Iron game,
[18497.10s -> 18500.88s]  I'd probably drop like 50 kills.
[18500.88s -> 18503.64s]  But I, so I do think you can climb out of any, you know,
[18503.64s -> 18519.84s]  any yellow, for sure.
[18519.84s -> 18522.48s]  You're loving a new count, if you guys got any of the bottom of the count
[18522.48s -> 18524.24s]  that answered every time I wrote a bot.
[18524.24s -> 18531.00s]  Ha ha ha.
[18531.00s -> 18539.85s]  That's funny.
[18539.85s -> 18541.61s]  Yeah, I assume that's a good point.
[18541.61s -> 18542.97s]  I guess if you're in Iron,
[18542.97s -> 18545.13s]  you could like play to learn the game a bit better,
[18545.13s -> 18546.61s]  and then you could like play a new account
[18546.61s -> 18547.93s]  and see where you got.
[18547.93s -> 18550.17s]  Yeah, I know that would work.
[18550.17s -> 18557.22s]  That makes sense.
[18557.22s -> 18559.14s]  Sure, I'll first pick man.
[18559.14s -> 18563.20s]  I'll first pick Santa.
[18563.20s -> 18566.64s]  I guarantee you they've all can fucking,
[18566.64s -> 18568.60s]  these people are gonna walk in fucking,
[18568.60s -> 18569.96s]  not a list or some shit's.
[18571.04s -> 18573.76s]  It'll be like jarvin, not a list.
[18576.76s -> 18583.20s]  I don't even know.
[18583.20s -> 18585.24s]  Riven's not too bad, we're saying it's okay.
[18585.24s -> 18586.04s]  So you know, we have flanks.
[18586.04s -> 18588.04s]  I actually don't think Riven's too bad right now.
[18588.04s -> 18589.92s]  Maybe all the ribbon players I've played against suck,
[18589.92s -> 18592.28s]  but I don't think she's actually that bad.
[18592.28s -> 18595.12s]  I think Riven's like, you have to position well.
[18595.12s -> 18598.76s]  I think Riven's really broken at abusing positioning.
[18598.76s -> 18600.92s]  That's why she's so good, it's all cute.
[18600.92s -> 18604.80s]  Like, good ribbon players, I'll get really gross flanks
[18604.80s -> 18606.36s]  and the flanks are what's okay.
[18606.36s -> 18607.52s]  Yeah, there's the grangas, okay.
[18607.52s -> 18611.58s]  I was like, they're gonna play something to fuck me over.
[18611.58s -> 18612.86s]  This guy picked Gragas,
[18612.86s -> 18615.06s]  but it was gonna be like J4 or Braggas or something.
[18616.22s -> 18617.54s]  And then this guy is the support,
[18617.54s -> 18618.90s]  help our big Nautilus.
[18620.30s -> 18623.06s]  Unless he's a one trick, right?
[18623.06s -> 18625.18s]  Well, unless this guy's straight up just like a one trick,
[18625.18s -> 18629.50s]  help pick like Nautilus or some shits.
[18629.50s -> 18635.60s]  Maybe Rakan, Rakan or Nautilus.
[18635.60s -> 18636.84s]  Because if he picks him in Chancer,
[18636.84s -> 18642.07s]  we just win the game.
[18642.07s -> 18647.48s]  He has to pick and gauge.
[18647.48s -> 18649.80s]  Mirio would be really good here, too, actually.
[18651.12s -> 18653.68s]  Because Mirio would counter half our team.
[18653.68s -> 18657.18s]  You can meerylq, woolcon, and cannon and gage.
[18658.78s -> 18660.02s]  Like if this guy put meeryl,
[18660.02s -> 18663.66s]  then it should actually be a hard line.
[18663.66s -> 18668.45s]  Tom, canch?
[18668.45s -> 18671.33s]  I mean, I get it, but I think it's bad.
[18673.05s -> 18674.61s]  Rins, oh shit.
[18675.49s -> 18679.41s]  Yo, you just saved me looking like an absolute fool.
[18679.41s -> 18680.25s]  Thank you.
[18681.65s -> 18682.65s]  Holy crap.
[18682.65s -> 18683.93s]  If you wanted to see my Rins, they're here,
[18683.93s -> 18684.93s]  but thank you, you remind me.
[18684.93s -> 18686.45s]  Now I'm gonna be able to get some water.
[18686.45s -> 18687.89s]  I'll be right back.
[18687.89s -> 18688.89s]  It's a moguah.
[18688.89s -> 18735.19s]  By the way, the people who are here to watch me play 80 carry, I sincerely apologize.
[18735.19s -> 18743.24s]  I know watching me play Senna is probably boring as fuck, okay?
[18743.24s -> 18744.24s]  I know.
[18744.24s -> 18748.64s]  And I promise you, we will play 80 carry at some point.
[18748.64s -> 18750.12s]  I promise you.
[18750.12s -> 18753.96s]  I played like the first four hours of the stream was 80 carry, and first three, right?
[18753.96s -> 18756.72s]  I put on my smurf for a few games and played some 80, so if you want to watch that
[18756.72s -> 18758.20s]  you can go back in the bottom.
[18758.20s -> 18763.54s]  is in my commentary and shit. The only reason I'm playing so much
[18763.54s -> 18768.42s]  Sennon and support on this account is because like the the hero I'm currently in is
[18768.42s -> 18775.36s]  like the worst hero to climb in solcu because of a lot of factors and support has
[18775.36s -> 18780.96s]  some of the highest impact on the game whereas like ADKRA has high impact
[18780.96s -> 18785.60s]  late but in solcu you want to have high impact early and I wanted to be able to
[18785.60s -> 18810.28s]  to impact the game really early on.
[18810.28s -> 18820.88s]  So yeah, sorry about being, you know, boring in shit.
[18820.88s -> 18823.24s]  I just really want to like win games.
[18824.52s -> 18825.56s]  At least on this account,
[18825.56s -> 18826.64s]  I want to get out of the CLO,
[18826.64s -> 18828.92s]  because the faster I get out of the CLO,
[18828.92s -> 18844.44s]  the faster, the faster I can have fun point 80 carry
[18846.72s -> 18847.88s]  and like, tranquiline.
[18849.68s -> 18852.12s]  What a weird, right?
[18852.12s -> 18853.60s]  What a weird play by these guys.
[18853.60s -> 18861.40s]  the fuck. They like half shoved the waves to get like early bush control and then I do
[18861.40s -> 18879.46s]  shit like that. This guy's just done. I'm gonna give it to Twitch. Nice. We got his exhaust.
[18880.26s -> 18884.50s]  So I wasted my exhaust there. I did it because I thought the jinx was gonna insta flash.
[18886.58s -> 18890.66s]  I didn't exhaust because I was like scared of her damage. I did it because I thought she was gonna
[18890.66s -> 18897.70s]  like try and flash away the second fits. But I reminded my snare. It was kind of bad by me. I
[18897.70s -> 18903.30s]  I mean, I went into my snare so I didn't need to exhaust her. I just was like, oh, maybe she'll flash. She did not she did not flash
[18905.22s -> 18908.42s]  What he was this this 500 LP masters 400 LP
[18910.02s -> 18912.02s]  In saying I know
[18912.66s -> 18935.49s]  Absolutely crazy
[18935.49s -> 18937.73s]  Put that ward there because Greg is probably bot
[18939.97s -> 18948.50s]  So
[18948.50s -> 18955.06s]  They're trying to come up from bot to kill me here like their bot names rotating up to try and kill me
[18955.06s -> 18961.50s]  Okay, so, just be careful to which they're in here, man.
[18961.50s -> 18972.92s]  I actually have to back and walk, look.
[18972.92s -> 18973.92s]  This is hilarious.
[18973.92s -> 18976.12s]  The enemy Bobane literally is roaming mid.
[18976.12s -> 18977.12s]  Look at this.
[18977.12s -> 18978.12s]  What?
[18978.12s -> 18981.00s]  Why?
[18981.00s -> 18991.13s]  I'm not trying to soak his XP, I just want those souls.
[18991.13s -> 19007.03s]  I'm scared to walk in here, I don't know where Greg is, I got to come bot to help my
[19007.03s -> 19016.12s]  twitch so they don't freeze the wave, like I don't want them to be able to freeze here.
[19016.12s -> 19022.31s]  of brackets ganks. We win the fight right now. Like it's an easy fight when as long
[19022.31s -> 19033.36s]  as we don't get knocked up we just win the fight automatically. Actually we're trying
[19033.36s -> 19065.38s]  to bait Gragas to come gank this easy double flash is baby easy you fucking cowards we should
[19065.38s -> 19073.98s]  back up like I can go buy now. Oh Gragas is top we could actually maybe do Dragon. Yo I'm
[19073.98s -> 19078.46s]  would be real. A soul roaming is not a not in like the top list of me being like nervous about it.
[19081.04s -> 19082.76s]  Like I'm not nervous about a soul roaming man.
[19086.44s -> 19088.84s]  Push this so we can over diving them.
[19090.00s -> 19093.68s]  That's a bit scary. Welcome to the league of Draven.
[19094.44s -> 19096.56s]  Good to see you're back to enjoying the game.
[19097.20s -> 19099.52s]  Oh, we're going to still diving that. That's not good.
[19100.44s -> 19101.68s]  Like we back off here, man.
[19107.10s -> 19109.42s]  I mean, we can maybe go up here if you really want to.
[19115.44s -> 19116.68s]  I kind of want to ward this.
[19116.68s -> 19130.41s]  I need to reset the really badly right now.
[19130.41s -> 19132.41s]  Really badly.
[19132.41s -> 19136.41s]  Not being on the map here is really bad.
[19136.41s -> 19141.41s]  Or rather not like having gold spent and being on the map is what I'm going to say.
[19141.41s -> 19143.41s]  Like it's a really fucking bad.
[19143.41s -> 19144.41s]  Yo, backup.
[19144.41s -> 19147.41s]  You know Greg is that you watched him walk past three wards.
[19147.41s -> 19149.41s]  That's why I just wanted.
[19149.41s -> 19151.41s]  No, no, he's still here.
[19151.41s -> 19153.41s]  Greg is right there.
[19153.41s -> 19168.63s]  I don't know where but we know he's there, they're on dragon, okay, we can fight this, go we go.
[19168.63s -> 19192.51s]  W over, I'm here. Nice, yeah, come here. Yeah, I'll help you, come get this, come get this, come get this, move first, blue.
[19192.51s -> 19229.34s]  I got you baby. What the fuck, made a bitch. Oh, I guess I'll back.
[19229.34s -> 19236.70s]  Yo Spartan, thank you for the six months man. Welcome back. I'll shade it. This will
[19236.70s -> 19243.34s]  back. We'll get our fucking umbral. I'm gonna go topside of the map now and I'm gonna
[19243.34s -> 19247.98s]  help my team get refterals. I'm gonna paint, I want to go topside, I want to help my
[19247.98s -> 19259.40s]  team get refts. The wave, if we look at bot wave, it's pushing into us. It's totally fine.
[19259.40s -> 19265.88s]  Okay. Twitch is level six. The bot wave is pushing in. We are totally fine.
[19265.88s -> 19286.67s]  to do what I'm doing right now. He doesn't know I'm here. I'm dead though.
[19286.67s -> 19303.09s]  Rho! No joke. I almost juked that. That's so close. I was hoping, like,
[19303.09s -> 19308.57s]  we'll call him for some reason, didn't walk top time. But the enemy bot lane did?
[19308.57s -> 19316.41s]  Okay, the enemy bot lane just grief their entire game. The game's over, we win.
[19316.41s -> 19323.55s]  What the fuck are they doing? What is happening? Like my Twitch is just getting free
[19323.55s -> 19345.48s]  place. Wait, you guys are griefing. I'm griefing. Dude, what the fuck? We, why would you
[19345.48s -> 19353.48s]  fight them guys? Guys, guys, we'll con. We'll con. Okay, we see that our Twitch is getting
[19353.48s -> 19359.40s]  free plates but free first to it. Okay, I'm back. I almost sold their 80 carry, okay?
[19359.40s -> 19366.86s]  Or they're jungler. Why would you ever on purpose take a four-off fight like that with no
[19367.56s -> 19370.80s]  Oh, I've cancer. I've also
[19371.40s -> 19376.40s]  The WooCone's idiot. He doesn't understand macro at all apparently because I literally
[19376.76s -> 19380.08s]  Painted to come to Rift my WooCone was like nervous
[19383.04s -> 19389.06s]  Like for some reason WooCone didn't walk top. He sat bot trying to gank, but the objective was rift not
[19391.36s -> 19393.44s]  God, I'm losing my mind in the C-Lo.
[19393.44s -> 19399.08s]  Master's players are literally just diamond players with slightly better mechanics.
[19399.08s -> 19405.30s]  They don't know anything about the game, and I'm about to my brains about to explode like a peanut.
[19405.30s -> 19409.26s]  It's not about them leaning to V2, you fucking come quad.
[19409.26s -> 19412.66s]  Dude, I know they can't leaning against this to V2.
[19412.66s -> 19414.50s]  It's not about the to V2, man.
[19414.50s -> 19419.46s]  We get a free ref-terald because we shut down their bot lane, and I'm on an item spike.
[19419.46s -> 19421.78s]  So we just automatically get a free ref.
[19421.78s -> 19428.39s]  It has nothing to do with 2v2. This come quad mother fucker.
[19433.75s -> 19437.11s]  I don't know why that's my insult. The pedestrian guy got to me.
[19439.35s -> 19449.48s]  Somehow. Where the fuck is this? Warren. Oh.
[19456.00s -> 19460.56s]  Because I'm telling you right now, my macro there was a hundred percent correct by the way. Like 1,000
[19460.56s -> 19475.57s]  percent. Or even though I died, I know it was correct. No, no, just do dragon. Do not die.
[19476.61s -> 19479.81s]  Guys, we don't have to, not everything's about kills, not everything's about kills. We got this.
[19480.61s -> 19483.97s]  like you don't need to dive you don't need to dive always you don't need to see it killed
[19483.97s -> 19489.33s]  be like ooh monkey kill brand go like the game is about like getting objectives on
[19489.33s -> 19494.29s]  timers and playing off of tempo and things like that like there are only
[19494.29s -> 19497.97s]  reason we even lost Rift was because my WooCon went full monkey brand and was
[19497.97s -> 19522.76s]  like no we need to not play for this Rift with a giant massively and wait
[19522.76s -> 19533.59s]  kill this guy one of my watching right now this is outrageous my
[19533.59s -> 19536.43s]  My Wukong is solo, I'm gonna lose it.
[19536.43s -> 19549.88s]  My Wukong is solo, I'll take their Gregus.
[19549.88s -> 19553.92s]  On a good note though, they don't get any plates off of rifting,
[19553.92s -> 19555.24s]  so it's not that bad.
[19556.88s -> 19557.88s]  Okay man, just push.
[19557.88s -> 19562.77s]  Like do hit the minions, like stop my bad.
[19564.05s -> 19566.01s]  Sorry, I'm wound up right now, Kenan.
[19566.01s -> 19570.69s]  Okay, I'm gonna wound apologies if I griefed you man.
[19572.61s -> 19573.45s]  That's fine.
[19573.45s -> 19576.05s]  So it wound up is fine.
[19576.05s -> 19579.93s]  I just don't like when stuff like that happens.
[19579.93s -> 19582.93s]  I'm a perfectionist and it's my big, oh, I talk about the story.
[19582.93s -> 19589.37s]  I'm a perfectionist, my biggest flaw is that I will play the game 100% correctly on
[19589.37s -> 19594.41s]  like tempo and timers, but you can't do that because you got to remember to like your teammates
[19594.41s -> 19595.41s]  or teammates.
[19595.41s -> 19613.51s]  Like they're not just going to instantly know exactly what to do.
[19613.51s -> 19625.81s]  when the guy don't just stand here and watch me die man holy shit that is oh my god if he
[19625.81s -> 19631.65s]  if he had let me die there I might have screamed actually screamed out loud in anger
[19635.09s -> 19638.37s]  like dude is watching me kite these people within one inch of my life
[19639.81s -> 19642.69s]  and instead of like helping and walking up and doing anything you know what he does
[19642.69s -> 19646.85s]  He pulls a fucking gross score.
[19646.85s -> 19652.11s]  My man just likes to watch.
[19652.11s -> 19655.15s]  It's on the wrong with it, but there's time in a place.
[19655.15s -> 19679.08s]  I don't actually want to buy pinks because I don't think we're strong enough that I don't think that we're so good enough that I can actually even defend the pinks right now if I'm being honest.
[19679.08s -> 19684.08s]  Like we should be strong enough, but we kind of throw a weed when I overforce the rift.
[19684.08s -> 19699.88s]  So I think we need to push this wave so that we can get tempo and move around the map.
[19699.88s -> 19711.48s]  around the map prior. Sorry, I keep saying the wrong thing. Uh-oh. That guy's dead. I have
[19711.48s -> 19719.56s]  to ditch that guy. He's dead as fuck. Oh, I'm dead too, maybe. I'm so dead. Yeah, that was my bad.
[19720.44s -> 19724.76s]  That was my bad. My bad, my bad, my bad, my bad. Like, we just got we just got ran down. That was on me.
[19727.90s -> 19737.42s]  Like, we had good positioning, but the jungler wasn't close enough. So this is my bad. I also didn't
[19737.42s -> 19744.17s]  expect to get fucking four-man's but I should have, right? We should play for this though.
[19745.05s -> 19747.53s]  I wish I could type, I wish I wasn't chat restricted for a year.
[19749.37s -> 19751.85s]  Third, I swear to God, I'm not even being mean.
[19752.81s -> 19756.57s]  Like Riot was like, are they chat restricted me because I type so much macro
[19757.13s -> 19759.77s]  that it gets on people's nerves and they don't want to be spam typing.
[19765.21s -> 19780.59s]  Bo-key, don't play for, don't play for rifts. I need help, guys. If you guys can help.
[19780.59s -> 19784.59s]  We need the clear vision on Dragon.
[19784.59s -> 19796.35s]  Yeah, I get on chat.
[19796.35s -> 19800.35s]  It starts at April 15th or April 11th or some shit.
[19800.35s -> 19802.35s]  Uh, 2024.
[19802.35s -> 19805.35s]  I've never seen it.
[19805.35s -> 19808.35s]  It must have been like an actual riot or something.
[19808.35s -> 19812.35s]  Like I've never seen an automated system give you a year chat restricts, right?
[19812.35s -> 19815.35s]  So in my mind, it's got to be like an actual like,
[19815.35s -> 19819.66s]  like a rioter was like, dronimo.
[19819.66s -> 19824.66s]  I mean, we know you're good enough to climb, but stop typing.
[19824.66s -> 19833.13s]  You know what I mean, that's like what must have been going on.
[19833.13s -> 19851.88s]  And I'm like, okay, well, sure.
[19851.88s -> 19854.88s]  I mean, I didn't know you could get chat band a year.
[19854.88s -> 19857.88s]  What's weird is like, I don't, I don't like say trigger words.
[19857.88s -> 19859.88s]  It's not like I tell people to like end themselves and stuff.
[19859.88s -> 19863.88s]  It's mainly just me typing like, go here, do that, do this.
[19863.88s -> 19865.88s]  Like I type a lot, right?
[19865.88s -> 19867.88s]  Which is obviously like, if you type a lot,
[19867.88s -> 19874.94s]  can be toxic as well, so like typing a lot to knowing so I get it.
[19886.53s -> 19892.53s]  We should be playing for barren side vision right now, not the vision we're playing with right now is bad.
[19892.53s -> 19893.53s]  We should be playing over here.
[19895.33s -> 19899.33s]  Like I want to play for barren vision, but it's a little hard to do that right now.
[19904.64s -> 19908.04s]  Cause you see how Tom can't even me or like transferring vision control around the map right now.
[19908.84s -> 19912.24s]  We're playing this little support game of like, hide the vision.
[19913.64s -> 19914.44s]  Look at this fuck.
[19915.64s -> 19959.77s]  Oh, he's so dumb. I still think he's dumb. How do I just take tonight?
[19959.77s -> 19967.72s]  I took my entire HP bar on a global. My bad. Dude, I really wish the mouth
[19967.72s -> 19972.12s]  fight would group though. I get that he's like doing the thing where he's like, oh,
[19972.12s -> 19977.04s]  So let's, you know, split, his play was actually really smart there.
[19977.04s -> 19978.60s]  The mouth fights play I'm in.
[19978.60s -> 19981.36s]  Like that wasn't his fault that we got shit on at all.
[19981.36s -> 19985.28s]  I just wish that he would group because if he groups up and hits our, we win every team
[19985.28s -> 19986.28s]  fight.
[19986.28s -> 19989.92s]  Because right now, our only frontliner is the Woo-Kong, right?
[19989.92s -> 19994.08s]  And the fact that Woo-Kong's our frontliner, we don't have the ability to play the game.
[19994.08s -> 19996.16s]  Well, I get stuck on that.
[19996.16s -> 19998.48s]  What the fuck was that?
[19998.48s -> 20003.60s]  Like that Tom Kinch getting to eat forward like that, blindly into our entire team,
[20003.60s -> 20007.12s]  and then not getting punished for it, might be the most like solo queue thing I've ever
[20007.12s -> 20008.12s]  seen.
[20008.12s -> 20021.25s]  Nobody wanted to hit him because he was the tank, but yeah, we should still kill him.
[20021.25s -> 20025.05s]  We can fight this guy, oh my god, jungler, just come.
[20025.05s -> 20030.77s]  Oh, we're forfeiting, okay, that makes perfect sense, right?
[20030.77s -> 20036.81s]  come group bro can and come group please guys like I don't know why everybody's
[20036.81s -> 20041.21s]  frustrated we're literally still up in gold please come group up we just
[20041.21s -> 20047.69s]  took it in heaven just just come group help me get vision on this dragon so
[20047.69s -> 20052.09s]  that I don't so we don't die like I need my team to actually walk over here to
[20052.09s -> 20057.96s]  help me get vision it's really frustrating because I need the front liners the
[20057.96s -> 20063.22s]  Who's calling in the mouth I had to walk in with me because I'm a little fucking why I have a big gun
[20063.22s -> 20068.90s]  But I'm a big gun girl, right? So I need I need these two guys to walk in with me these two big burly mountain men
[20074.40s -> 20079.86s]  So that I can play the game, you know, no we don't push bot no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[20079.96s -> 20085.42s]  Me, no spot is worthless come in my mouth I'd pushing the wave that we already have down
[20086.18s -> 20088.18s]  I wish I could macro
[20088.18s -> 20091.98s]  I wish I could type some macro right now. They're they're like well my team is so lost
[20092.66s -> 20100.21s]  They're so beyond lost right now. It's crazy. They're lost this shit
[20100.71s -> 20112.10s]  Just dude dude Dragon yes, just do this just do I'll start it for you here you go
[20112.82s -> 20122.84s]  I don't know why we're standing in a bush waiting for them to face check dude Dragon guess I'm so I swear to God
[20123.04s -> 20128.64s]  You have to do everything in the Z-Lo where you have to start every fight. I have to basically I have to start every fight
[20128.64s -> 20133.68s]  right? I have to not only start every fight, but I have to like ping my team what to do exactly
[20134.24s -> 20136.80s]  Because everybody plays so safe in this yellow
[20137.44s -> 20139.68s]  Why did my mouth fight just stop his back?
[20141.52s -> 20143.52s]  Why are you all fighting?
[20143.52s -> 20149.01s]  Oh my god, please guys
[20149.73s -> 20154.77s]  It's fine, it's fine
[20155.17s -> 20158.05s]  No mouth fight you can't one be nine that just back off
[20158.53s -> 20162.53s]  They didn't get anything they didn't get anything we got dragon or on dragon soul points
[20162.53s -> 20167.97s]  I'm losing hairs, I'm losing fucking hairs man.
[20167.97s -> 20170.37s]  I ain't got many hairs to spare anymore.
[20170.37s -> 20177.72s]  We're out here, losing hair.
[20177.72s -> 20181.68s]  I'm babysitting, this has got to be what a preschool teacher feels like, you know?
[20181.68s -> 20191.76s]  Like a low key, like preschool teacher just feels like this, this has to be it.
[20191.76s -> 20195.08s]  Like watching a toddler, like you watch them from the corner, right?
[20195.08s -> 20196.72s]  And they're like eating glue.
[20196.72s -> 20199.00s]  And you're like, I mean, that's mad.
[20199.00s -> 20201.64s]  And then you tell them like, don't eat glue to me.
[20201.64s -> 20205.32s]  And he's like, okay, and then like, you lead him there for five minutes to go like do something
[20205.32s -> 20208.64s]  to watch somebody else, then all of a sudden Timmy's seen glue again, and you're like,
[20208.64s -> 20221.05s]  bro, bro, we just had this discussion.
[20221.05s -> 20224.85s]  And it's like not Timmy's fault, right, because he's a toddler.
[20224.85s -> 20227.25s]  So you can't be mad at Timmy because he's a toddler.
[20227.25s -> 20228.25s]  You can't.
[20228.25s -> 20229.65s]  But it's like, it's frustrating.
[20229.65s -> 20242.38s]  It's like, dammit, man.
[20242.38s -> 20243.38s]  Like, what is happening?
[20243.38s -> 20244.98s]  Like, mouth, I just group.
[20244.98s -> 20248.62s]  My mouthhead has a fetish with just pushing bot.
[20248.62s -> 20249.90s]  Bro, just group and hit R.
[20251.62s -> 20254.62s]  Bro, I know you have Bork.
[20254.62s -> 20257.92s]  Wait, you have Bork?
[20257.92s -> 20262.60s]  Bro, we need to be able to engage.
[20262.60s -> 20263.68s]  We don't win through split.
[20264.84s -> 20266.32s]  Just group up and R and we win.
[20267.84s -> 20269.72s]  Like I've been controlling the ever-loving fuck out
[20269.72s -> 20271.52s]  of all the vision this game.
[20271.52s -> 20274.32s]  I feel like I'm doing all of this to control vision and shit.
[20274.32s -> 20276.88s]  And it still feels like it's not enough.
[20276.88s -> 20280.99s]  It's kinda nuts.
[20280.99s -> 20292.97s]  Okay, it still feels not enough. No, don't go back. Don't go back. Don't go back. Please don't go back.
[20294.61s -> 20306.15s]  Did me they don't have a word. They don't know I'm there.

[20394.14s -> 20409.10s]  Dude, I swear to God, get these people are not real, but we do not need the mouth fight.
[20409.10s -> 20412.10s]  I am a higher level than my jungler.
[20412.10s -> 20421.84s]  Pushmen, guys, you gotta pushmen first. Listen, homies, you gotta pushmen first.
[20421.84s -> 20428.95s]  You know what, fuck it, don't even go in, yeah, fuck it, pushmen.
[20428.95s -> 20433.95s]  We're just gonna end the game. If they go for dragon here, we just push, fuck it.
[20433.95s -> 20441.95s]  That's actually such a good macro call, not even joking.
[20441.95s -> 20455.82s]  Such a good macro call actually
[20461.32s -> 20463.32s]  Everybody just run though just run
[20464.04s -> 20468.96s]  Don't don't oldie in no guys we don't fight this whole I've cancer
[20469.96s -> 20471.96s]  We're getting flanks boys
[20472.36s -> 20475.88s]  Dude I have such high levels of cancer right now. You have no idea
[20476.88s -> 20479.38s]  Like I fucking functioning cancer
[20480.32s -> 20520.03s]  You guys just killed the fucking Gregus. Oh my god. Thank god. Thank god. Just end the game
[20520.03s -> 20523.47s]  Please end the game. Please hit the fucking thick.
[20523.47s -> 20530.11s]  Oh my god. Walter White is like my hero right now.
[20530.11s -> 20535.39s]  I don't even understand. Like I feel like I feel like what Walter White felt like
[20535.39s -> 20539.55s]  dealing with Skyler for literally three years. Like this is outrageous.
[20540.51s -> 20545.15s]  This is what this feels like. Like I can relate to the show so much more.
[20545.15s -> 20576.68s]  Oh my god, like dude, I- Oh, crap.
[20578.68s -> 20580.68s]  Dude, look it, look it, look it, look it, look it like,
[20580.68s -> 20582.68s]  look it like what's going on in the game.
[20582.68s -> 20591.66s]  Like, I don't even mean to be mean about this.
[20591.66s -> 20593.66s]  It's just, this is crazy.
[20593.66s -> 20598.25s]  Malfight though, pop and off.
[20599.25s -> 20609.67s]  Malfight, pop and off.
[20609.67s -> 20610.67s]  Like, what do you use this guy?
[20610.67s -> 20614.75s]  He's literally diamonds.
[20614.75s -> 20621.26s]  Why is this guy in this game?
[20621.26s -> 20623.26s]  I mean, I feel like confused now.
[20623.26s -> 20626.94s]  Confused now. I'm not even blaming the Wukong anymore. I don't know why this guy is in the game.
[20628.22s -> 20637.47s]  Oh, he hasn't played to the SMMR. Oh, he just has previous season inflated MMR.
[20638.19s -> 20640.91s]  That's what this is. Because he was GM for three years.
[20642.19s -> 20646.59s]  So the SMMR says that he like belongs here even though he doesn't play it. Like I bet you last season
[20646.59s -> 20652.72s]  he only played like 50 games. I can look, right? We're going to see like I'm going to
[20652.72s -> 20657.18s]  games he put in. Yeah he played it. He played like 50 games last season. So like his
[20657.18s -> 20661.68s]  Emma Martin really changed. He just got masters and then stopped. Which is fine.
[20661.68s -> 20675.32s]  There's only one with that's I just wish he would chill you know. Like a not
[20675.32s -> 20681.45s]  rage quit halfway through the game. Because I was like I said people's elo and
[20681.45s -> 20684.05s]  shit used to bother me a lot. I don't get bothered by any more because I
[20684.05s -> 20687.49s]  realized that was cringe. I don't care about their elo and shit. What I care
[20687.49s -> 20690.45s]  about is like I just want them to play the game. You know what I mean? Like I just
[20690.45s -> 20694.49s]  want them to not rage, not like the absolute apes in the game and just play. That's all I
[20694.49s -> 20698.29s]  ask for. I don't care if you're a time-of-player plot player on the game and you're just like
[20698.29s -> 20701.33s]  accidentally in the game. I guess I hear fault. I just want you to push buttons.
[20701.33s -> 20713.36s]  I'm wondering wrong to have a 36% win rate. I can't see the link because just you
[20713.36s -> 20719.17s]  don't have to give me your name and your server. How are you guys doing by the way?
[20719.17s -> 20724.05s]  Everybody having a good day? You guys enjoy the stream having a good time? Watching me go
[20724.05s -> 20728.49s]  bald in live, like live time, you guys are like, oh, what? Dronimo's going bald live on
[20728.49s -> 20733.85s]  stream and I'm like, yeah, it's rough. Well, I'm gonna take my pants off.
[20773.61s -> 20780.25s]  Dude, what I, I, fuck you guys. They fucking, like I get double swapped. Did you get see that
[20780.25s -> 20785.61s]  shit? They're like, oh, yeah, the support could do it. And then he banned Santa. I mean, I didn't hover
[20785.61s -> 20790.97s]  it. That's my bad. God damn it. I should have hovered. I was just like taking my pants off.
[20790.97s -> 20803.43s]  And now he wants first pick dude what oh my god, I hate I don't I don't I don't I don't know what to say
[20803.43s -> 20804.43s]  This is crazy
[20804.43s -> 20810.69s]  Today's Thursday, right?
[20811.69s -> 20814.29s]  I might be losing days today's Thursday, right guys?
[20822.96s -> 20824.96s]  It is okay cool.
[20825.62s -> 20828.60s]  Oh, what do I play there, Zareth and the Zinn?
[20830.06s -> 20842.07s]  I'm gonna get this play with Con, something to it. Let's see what they're bobbling is though
[20842.07s -> 20844.99s]  I actually have to see what their bobbling is to choose my runes
[20845.61s -> 20858.63s]  So no, no. Oh, they have an Ezreal. The fuck is their team comp? Um, okay?
[20859.19s -> 20888.91s]  When you do this build, what's the secondaries supposed to be? I think it's supposed to be this. Or maybe like revitalize?
[20888.91s -> 20889.71s]  I
[20889.71s -> 20895.88s]  Just like on flinching so good. Oh, they have a support
[20897.16s -> 20900.16s]  Zero. So sports out. Yeah, yeah, okay, so I want I
[20900.96s -> 20903.44s]  Definitely want Glacial here, and I want
[20903.44s -> 20908.88s]  on. Maybe I take MR actually instead of armor because they have two
[20908.88s -> 20917.88s]  poke jumps. And I take this. Yeah, this is good. Okay. That's not bad. Okay.
[20918.60s -> 20920.44s]  Once I, I'll be able to get to more water.
[20982.89s -> 20984.73s]  Burn.
[20985.77s -> 20989.21s]  Burn. Oh shit. No. Don't flag me.
[20991.21s -> 20992.17s]  Fuck man. I'd pee.
[20993.53s -> 20995.53s]  Fucking flag me for AFK because I take a leak
[20996.45s -> 21002.14s]  Can you not start with 80 carry the move over to support? I always fall asleep before the 80 carry game play
[21003.22s -> 21005.94s]  Wait, what I fell asleep before 80 carry
[21006.70s -> 21008.70s]  What do you mean? Oh?
[21008.70s -> 21011.34s]  You mean like start with my main and then play
[21013.78s -> 21015.78s]  Yeah, I played 80 carry at the start. I
[21026.17s -> 21028.17s]  Should probably
[21029.45s -> 21031.77s]  Play 80 carry more over support
[21033.77s -> 21059.66s]  Waiter in the stream. They're all point 80 carry game after this. I feel bad. Oh, it's Gregus. I thought it was going to be Xara, but it's Gregus
[21060.38s -> 21068.39s]  I don't want to fight too hard level 1 even though that that I should have gone in there. That was my bad
[21068.95s -> 21072.67s]  I want to I want to try and get level 2 here even though I think we actually win level 1
[21073.67s -> 21079.44s]  Oh, I got his bone pointing. Yeah, I should have fought level 1. That was my bad
[21080.48s -> 21083.04s]  Because we went very hard level 1. I just griefed it
[21083.04s -> 21086.14s]  the
[21086.14s -> 21088.04s]  all have to do there is going on the
[21088.04s -> 21090.04s]  as real or the bragas of one and they can't play the game
[21090.04s -> 21108.08s]  right
[21108.08s -> 21110.08s]  it's not worth it's not worth
[21110.08s -> 21115.39s]  there's no way that I cannot get eat by Gregor's there by the way
[21115.39s -> 21121.92s]  like I don't know if I can flash their either
[21121.92s -> 21131.54s]  maybe we shouldn't be going buddy
[21131.54s -> 21153.31s]  guys just fucking egos in front of me like what
[21153.31s -> 21155.51s]  Okay, I might have missed everything there, but like,
[21157.71s -> 21171.70s]  you know, that's okay.
[21172.10s -> 21173.50s]  It's a little counterproductive.
[21175.60s -> 21178.20s]  When I take a tower shot to land a queue,
[21179.80s -> 21181.10s]  feels a little counterproductive.
[21189.17s -> 21197.96s]  But hey, I'm gonna back here, just in case the enemy
[21197.96s -> 21199.46s]  is in tries to get in command.
[21202.09s -> 21204.29s]  Dude, I'm so sad, I can't get boots.
[21209.67s -> 21210.47s]  I'm gonna wait.
[21210.47s -> 21217.17s]  Yeah, I'm gonna be cringe. I'm gonna wait. I would never wait here normally, but you know what? It's just it's so like it's such a big buy
[21218.87s -> 21224.69s]  I don't want to I'm I'm off now that now that I've waited and beat cringe now. I have to sit here and wait
[21224.69s -> 21229.39s]  Oh, it's so painful. Okay. I'm gonna wait. I'm sorry, I guess
[21247.39s -> 21254.08s]  We're at the wait. No, not at all. I got lucky, but
[21254.92s -> 21269.81s]  You know what's interesting? I never used the stupid dematerializer
[21269.81s -> 21274.53s]  I think I should have like I should use it on every cannon or some shit, but I just don't do it
[21275.17s -> 21278.13s]  Because I know the reason you're supposed to use it is because it helps you push
[21278.81s -> 21281.61s]  Because you can demonetirialize the cannon right and just instant yeah
[21282.45s -> 21285.17s]  So you're supposed to use it because it's like a really fast way to push but it's also
[21286.53s -> 21305.08s]  I should not have w'd fuck I
[21305.08s -> 21310.04s]  Well, not the gruggess anywhere. I fucked up. I shouldn't have w'd the gruggess. I should have put it soar
[21312.73s -> 21314.73s]  This guy is gonna die
[21314.73s -> 21319.73s]  I will make it, oh, he's gonna die, put himself against the wall, Gigi.
[21319.73s -> 21330.96s]  That was my fault though, 100% because if I didn't W in, they can't kill us, right?
[21330.96s -> 21333.96s]  And Greg is probably dies to the auto attack anyway.
[21333.96s -> 21338.96s]  My thought process was Greg is snared, so if I W here, but even after, like, even if I don't get
[21338.96s -> 21341.96s]  Eat, I'm pretty confident I die.
[21341.96s -> 21387.14s]  Am I trying, I was out of everything.
[21387.14s -> 21391.46s]  If I could have played that better, maybe like if I could have weaved an extra auto in or something
[21392.58s -> 21394.58s]  I don't know
[21394.78s -> 21414.00s]  It's hard to know all right. I'm gonna go mid here
[21415.24s -> 21419.12s]  I can't okay
[21419.12s -> 21422.32s]  What could go mid but I think I I think I want to say bought for a bit and get some XP
[21422.88s -> 21431.35s]  I think it's smarter to do that at this point. I think we should push this I
[21448.00s -> 21450.00s]  Don't want to W in because I know Zen Seria
[21451.60s -> 21453.84s]  That's why I didn't want to W because I know Zen Seria
[21453.84s -> 21471.15s]  They were just making it so obvious, right? Like that it was like
[21472.67s -> 21476.91s]  Sometimes when people make shit too good to be true. It is too good to be true
[21478.67s -> 21481.39s]  Like oh shit we're just gonna they're just gonna fight us here cool
[21483.31s -> 21489.82s]  Oh, yeah, I gotta help him push my bed. I'm playing sloppy
[21515.66s -> 21517.66s]  You just wanna see a cool trick watch us
[21517.66s -> 21523.55s]  She could push the wave and then just min max the back
[21525.47s -> 21530.44s]  How cool was that
[21530.44s -> 21534.24s]  She just pushes the wave and I just back next to the bush and she's just like, oh, I guess I'll take the free ride
[21534.24s -> 21548.01s]  I
[21548.01s -> 21550.01s]  Really need level six
[21550.01s -> 21565.84s]  Bad way like bro. I really cannot get level six right now. This is
[21567.28s -> 21573.45s]  painful
[21573.45s -> 21575.85s]  Hey, kill these maybe I'm six off this. Nope. Guess not
[21577.13s -> 21580.25s]  I was gonna stay mid there by the way and help the homie
[21581.61s -> 21612.51s]  I need to go mid
[21612.51s -> 21627.79s]  This is so awkward
[21627.79s -> 21635.96s]  Bro help me
[21635.96s -> 21638.36s]  Bro, like, you gotta walk to me.
[21638.36s -> 21641.88s]  Like, I can't, like, my Eve is like here.
[21641.88s -> 21643.60s]  I'm way over here.
[21644.72s -> 21649.97s]  Right? And my Eve's like, yo, homie.
[21649.97s -> 21651.77s]  Like dude, I'm, like, we're trying to push the way
[21651.77s -> 21653.09s]  even for her.
[21653.09s -> 21659.57s]  And she's just not accepting to wait.
[21659.57s -> 21660.93s]  And I can't w the wall.
[21660.93s -> 21662.93s]  I mean, I guess I could w the wall
[21662.93s -> 21664.33s]  because I was trying to walk around, right?
[21664.33s -> 21666.05s]  I saw her in trouble when I was here.
[21666.05s -> 21667.65s]  So I wanted her to walk towards here,
[21667.65s -> 21669.85s]  so I could e over the wall.
[21669.85s -> 21671.05s]  That was my thought process.
[21671.05s -> 21673.05s]  E over the wall helped the guy.
[21673.05s -> 21674.85s]  But you like didn't understand that
[21674.85s -> 21682.11s]  and I just got shit on it felt really bad.
[21682.11s -> 21686.61s]  Both our souls are getting absolutely shit on.
[21686.61s -> 21687.61s]  This is very bad.
[21688.61s -> 21690.61s]  Because I don't know how to help our team
[21690.61s -> 21695.08s]  at this stage.
[21695.08s -> 21697.08s]  Like I'm just always behind on tempo now
[21697.08s -> 21700.08s]  around the map in the wrong spot at the wrong time.
[21700.08s -> 21725.88s]  This is so awkward.
[21725.88s -> 21727.88s]  I have a whole week of kill this guy.
[21727.88s -> 21733.88s]  I guess not.
[21733.88s -> 21738.42s]  and
[21738.42s -> 21757.81s]  if it may be kills in if I sneak in here
[21757.81s -> 21776.08s]  push the way push the way of hurry
[21776.08s -> 21782.18s]  he's got a crash it
[21782.18s -> 21784.18s]  in this guy's just dead
[21784.18s -> 21794.16s]  my 80 carries going to get fucked for it though so I hope it was worth
[21794.16s -> 21796.16s]  my 80 carries going to get zones
[21796.16s -> 21799.16s]  it's really hard to tell if anything like that's worth sometimes because
[21799.16s -> 21803.16s]  I used my old before a dragon fight we're going to lose bot tower there's so many factors right it's so far
[21803.16s -> 21806.78s]  hard and now I don't have words. Oh, it's so rough.
[21806.78s -> 21832.20s]  I got the ignite off, but dude, I can't put that Gregus lived. No. Oh, I had stop watch!
[21832.20s -> 21838.80s]  I have stop watch. Oh my god, I'm the worst player in existence. I actually have the ability
[21838.80s -> 21850.79s]  to live there. Oh no. I should sell my magis and shame. I actually just want the item
[21850.79s -> 21852.79s]  I'm so
[21852.79s -> 21854.79s]  Dude, I'm so bad
[21855.43s -> 21859.67s]  Dude, Greg is as low-key at good pick versus Recon though. You can stop his engage so easily
[21868.58s -> 21870.58s]  It's actually low-key at good pick
[21896.47s -> 21921.89s]  Bro
[21921.89s -> 21935.59s]  Nice not bad. I kind of want to back off here
[21938.04s -> 21941.72s]  You don't feel it's kind of bad. He has noticed that I just I got my
[21943.40s -> 21945.40s]  I don't think I was noticed this but I got my fucking
[21948.85s -> 21952.05s]  I got like four assists just now, but it was after
[21952.85s -> 21956.85s]  I sold my magis. How fucking bad does that feel?
[21957.97s -> 21966.44s]  Like actually oh by the way, uh, I want to ask you guys
[21968.44s -> 21971.00s]  What 80 carry do you guys think is the most?
[21971.88s -> 21981.49s]  Saw out for people to learn right now like what would you say is like people want to learn this 80 carry over other 80 carries?
[21982.13s -> 21984.13s]  What do you guys think in
[21984.13s -> 22000.16s]  My man says Timo, okay? Make sense. Got it. Depends. Yeah, I'm just trying to wonder like what
[22002.00s -> 22009.74s]  People would want to watch or what people would want to learn specifically. So I know everybody plays different shit, but I know there's also like popular shit, you know
[22015.16s -> 22017.16s]  Okay, I'm just bad
[22017.48s -> 22020.16s]  He's bad too. We listen we're bad
[22023.48s -> 22068.97s]  We're bad guys
[22068.97s -> 22072.35s]  Oh, not bad.
[22072.35s -> 22074.67s]  Genolutions, I have failures.
[22074.67s -> 22076.27s]  Dammit, is it like just that different?
[22076.27s -> 22080.22s]  Like a lot of people like different stuff?
[22080.22s -> 22090.64s]  Cause I've always just thought like, oh, no.
[22090.64s -> 22096.03s]  I guess I've always just thought that people like,
[22096.03s -> 22097.95s]  a lot of people really like meta 80 carriers
[22097.95s -> 22100.23s]  or like really playmaking 80 carriers, right?
[22100.23s -> 22103.07s]  Like, jinx is probably the best 80 carry in the meta,
[22103.07s -> 22104.83s]  but I don't say a lot of people ever ask
[22104.83s -> 22107.63s]  or request to watch jinx.
[22107.63s -> 22108.47s]  You know what I mean?
[22108.47s -> 22110.63s]  Like jinx is not like, she's not like a fun 80 carrier
[22110.63s -> 22112.15s]  that people want to learn how to play.
[22112.15s -> 22114.39s]  Even though she is the best AD,
[22114.39s -> 22116.67s]  there's the people who are like, oh, yeah, no jinx is boring.
[22116.67s -> 22118.27s]  I got wanna play gin and shoot people.
[22118.27s -> 22119.99s]  I wanna play like Lucian and Dashram.
[22119.99s -> 22121.23s]  Like it's like, so that's what I'm wondering
[22121.23s -> 22122.99s]  is like what the number one AD carry is
[22122.99s -> 22140.36s]  for people just like enjoy watching.
[22140.36s -> 22141.76s]  Not bad though.
[22141.76s -> 22143.88s]  Okay, I think we could play an AD carry game.
[22143.88s -> 22147.28s]  Down.
[22147.28s -> 22149.84s]  I owe you guys an AD carry game.
[22149.84s -> 22151.68s]  I owe you that much for watching me play support
[22151.68s -> 22153.04s]  for two hours.
[22153.04s -> 22157.45s]  Actually, I think it was like two and a half hours.
[22157.45s -> 22158.69s]  Yeah, we put four games to support.
[22158.69s -> 22159.77s]  So it's like two hours.
[22161.05s -> 22169.24s]  Yeah, oh, you guys for that.
[22169.24s -> 22170.48s]  Ziya or Vin?
[22170.48s -> 22171.84s]  Ziya is fun to watch.
[22171.84s -> 22173.20s]  I do like Ziya.
[22173.20s -> 22174.08s]  You'll love Jinks and Kate.
[22174.08s -> 22181.89s]  Oh, there you go.
[22181.89s -> 22182.69s]  You're playing supports,
[22182.69s -> 22184.29s]  I hope you like to watch how you carry this plant.
[22184.29s -> 22185.13s]  Ah.
[22186.77s -> 22188.65s]  So that you can like better help the homies.
[22188.65s -> 22202.36s]  Got it, got it.
[22202.36s -> 22203.76s]  We need eight wins, I think.
[22203.76s -> 22205.12s]  From this point, we are right now.
[22205.12s -> 22208.60s]  I think it's eight wins to get to Grandmaster.
[22208.60s -> 22213.68s]  I think, oops.
[22213.68s -> 22219.56s]  because we're what, 370 something, right, like 360?
[22219.56s -> 22222.76s]  No, we just won, we're not 360, we're like 370.
[22224.36s -> 22226.96s]  We're 387, okay, so it's not updated,
[22226.96s -> 22228.60s]  but what is this?
[22228.60s -> 22233.57s]  Stop, so we need what?
[22233.57s -> 22236.89s]  Seven wins, net wins to get to GM.
[22237.85s -> 22241.17s]  I think we can hit GM, I'm a little less confident
[22241.17s -> 22243.73s]  right now about master or about challenger,
[22243.73s -> 22245.45s]  but I think we can definitely hit GM.
[22245.45s -> 22258.14s]  Like I think I'll get stuck in gym for a bit, unless the games get higher quality.
[22258.14s -> 22265.20s]  I'll be stuck in gym for a little bit.
[22265.20s -> 22270.44s]  Because the thing about the games so far is like the higher quality the games get,
[22270.44s -> 22274.88s]  the easier it actually is to carry if like if you're a decent player.
[22274.88s -> 22278.44s]  Because the better your teammates get, which means that like if you're at that, like
[22278.44s -> 22281.84s]  say like a challenger player will have a better time, a challenger, any carrier player,
[22281.84s -> 22286.40s]  carrying in Challenger if they get a lead, then in Diamond if they get a lead.
[22286.40s -> 22292.32s]  If that, like, I know that sounds weird to say, but it's basically just because, like,
[22292.32s -> 22296.72s]  when your teammates are better, they enable you better and 80 carry in all those other roles,
[22296.72s -> 22305.30s]  when they're being enabled, it's a lot easier to play the game.
[22305.30s -> 22310.90s]  Like, if I were to first pick Jinks in Challenger MMR, there's a good chance my teammates would pick
[22310.90s -> 22315.14s]  stuff that, like, let's meet play Jinks, right? Not saying what happened, but there's like a
[22315.14s -> 22319.22s]  chance that my teammates would pick something that like they would pick like tanks or
[22319.22s -> 22323.46s]  front liners or some shit, right? Or like Lulu. Whereas like if you pick and if you're picking
[22323.46s -> 22328.50s]  jinx first pick and like, let's say you guys are gold average, but your support might just literally
[22328.50s -> 22344.87s]  pick like first time Velcons or some shit and you're like, well, this sucks. Dude, I swear every time
[22344.87s -> 22353.11s]  I hear the end of this song. Does anyone know who forest within is? I swear the guy talking at the
[22353.11s -> 22353.95s]  at the end of this song,
[22353.95s -> 22355.85s]  sounds exactly like forced within.
[22357.23s -> 22366.97s]  No joke, listen to this, listen to this.
[22366.97s -> 22369.37s]  That guy who was like saying it was DJ,
[22369.37s -> 22371.01s]  like, like, that guy sounded exactly like,
[22371.01s -> 22372.81s]  I don't know why my brain does that.
[22372.81s -> 22375.09s]  When we sound of exactly like forced within,
[22375.09s -> 22379.09s]  I swear to God, it's actually like perfectly.
[22379.09s -> 22380.25s]  Like if you told me that was him,
[22380.25s -> 22386.81s]  I would immediately believe you.
[22386.81s -> 22390.61s]  This guy wants to join the discord.
[22390.61s -> 22394.49s]  Oh, I'm nervous about this shit.
[22394.49s -> 22396.33s]  It is my support though.
[22396.33s -> 22403.54s]  So like maybe we could join the discord and like work together a bit.
[22410.43s -> 22420.90s]  But I'm also nervous about joining discord calls of people on stream.
[22420.90s -> 22422.86s]  Well, I don't know.
[22422.86s -> 22424.54s]  I don't know if it's worth.
[22424.54s -> 22426.38s]  Where would you put Ezreal on the tier list?
[22426.38s -> 22428.22s]  I think Ezreal's A tier.
[22428.22s -> 22431.58s]  I think he could be S tier for solo queue, but he's hard.
[22431.58s -> 22432.58s]  He's really hard.
[22432.58s -> 22433.98s]  Ezreal's one of the hardest cities.
[22433.98s -> 22437.14s]  So I would say he's like A tier right now.
[22437.14s -> 22442.14s]  If you're really good at this, he is very, very, very strong.
[22442.54s -> 22444.66s]  But he's also incredibly hard to play.
[22446.30s -> 22448.50s]  But he also is not weak in the meta.
[22448.50s -> 22451.14s]  So I give him like strong A,
[22452.94s -> 22455.10s]  like above other A's.
[22456.70s -> 22458.62s]  She focused on major sports, like brand Xerooth
[22458.62s -> 22460.82s]  or engage, like, what's not to us.
[22460.82s -> 22463.94s]  It depends on your eloan of the pens on what you're doing.
[22463.94s -> 22466.14s]  I think engage supports and lower eloan
[22466.14s -> 22474.46s]  are bad, I don't know, somebody dodged.
[22474.46s -> 22478.26s]  I think engage supports in the lower Evo are bad personally
[22478.26s -> 22484.37s]  because I think that you can be a really good engage player
[22484.37s -> 22487.17s]  and it doesn't matter if your team just gets caught
[22487.17s -> 22489.53s]  over and over again or if you like make it engage
[22489.53s -> 22491.29s]  and your team misplay is right.
[22491.29s -> 22495.29s]  So it's like, if you want to play engage supports, do it
[22495.29s -> 22497.17s]  because they are better than other,
[22497.17s -> 22499.65s]  like engage opponents are better than mages,
[22499.65s -> 22502.13s]  but I think in solo queue mages are better
[22502.13s -> 22503.65s]  are so okay.
[22503.65s -> 22504.65s]  So it just depends.
[22504.65s -> 22505.93s]  It depends on your ego, it depends on
[22505.93s -> 22508.01s]  what you're trying to accomplish, right?
[22508.01s -> 22509.81s]  Because a lot of the time is a support player.
[22509.81s -> 22511.85s]  It's why I play Sennon, right?
[22511.85s -> 22515.41s]  I play Sennon because I like being able to carry games
[22515.41s -> 22516.85s]  as support.
[22516.85s -> 22517.89s]  That's why I like Sennon.
[22519.33s -> 22520.69s]  Whereas if you're a,
[22522.41s -> 22524.89s]  like if I can play almost every support,
[22524.89s -> 22527.81s]  I can play not on this, I can play, I can play these supports.
[22527.81s -> 22529.69s]  But the problem is, is like I feel bad
[22529.69s -> 22531.77s]  if I get, like if it feels really shitty
[22531.77s -> 22533.65s]  to get people ahead and then have them completely
[22533.65s -> 22534.97s]  through their reads over and over again
[22534.97s -> 22536.41s]  and then tell them rage and shit.
[22536.41s -> 22538.25s]  So it feels like dog shit.
[22538.25s -> 22539.89s]  So it's nice, sort of just like give myself
[22539.89s -> 22542.77s]  the opportunity to carry it rather than rely
[22542.77s -> 22547.28s]  100% on other people, you know?
[22547.28s -> 22549.48s]  But I would say the number one thing is
[22550.52s -> 22552.52s]  play what you think is fun.
[22552.52s -> 22553.68s]  That's just the number one rule.
[22553.68s -> 22557.08s]  Like playing, if you wanna win, you can play meta,
[22557.08s -> 22559.32s]  but the problem is, is if you're shoving your face
[22559.32s -> 22560.52s]  and I'll try to learn a meta champ
[22560.52s -> 22562.32s]  that you just don't enjoy the place that I love,
[22562.32s -> 22565.08s]  you're never gonna actually be good at the champion
[22565.08s -> 22567.64s]  because you're like, it's like you're working, right?
[22567.64s -> 22569.44s]  But the best way to learn the champions
[22569.44s -> 22571.88s]  and learn how to play the game is to have fun.
[22571.88s -> 22573.84s]  Cause if you're not having fun at some point,
[22573.84s -> 22576.44s]  you're not gonna be able to learn how to play.
[22576.44s -> 22577.92s]  Cause you're not gonna be able to put in the hours
[22577.92s -> 22580.44s]  or put in the games and be focused during the game,
[22580.44s -> 22581.56s]  you're gonna be frustrated.
[22581.56s -> 22583.48s]  And if you're frustrated, you're not gonna be learning.
[22583.48s -> 22588.66s]  So I always say, just play something that's fun.
[22588.66s -> 22596.44s]  The fun aspect is gonna be way more important.
[22596.44s -> 22609.10s]  We're not a musicer, the fuck?
[22609.10s -> 22610.66s]  I'm surprised, can you guys even hear the music
[22610.66s -> 22615.86s]  half the time. I have it on solo that I'm not even sure you guys can hear it. It's just like
[22615.86s -> 22646.90s]  barely background noise. Is this guy holding swap hostage? Join call and I'll swap.
[22653.57s -> 22669.00s]  Dude, he's holding swap hostage. By the way, if you guys do like the stream, don't forget the
[22669.00s -> 22674.92s]  follow. You can scroll down to see all my socials too. Like TikTok, Instagram, all that crap.
[22674.92s -> 22687.46s]  It's all about the stream. There's like links and shit and you know
[22689.10s -> 22705.36s]  A man's got to eat you can just put your prime to if you want you know feel on it. I'm gonna do a kise game
[22705.86s -> 22709.56s]  He went bucks
[22709.80s -> 22712.52s]  But I kind of want to play kise
[22716.05s -> 22718.81s]  What was the voice this is what happens when I get close to the mic?
[22721.97s -> 22727.61s]  I should put the mic in front of my face more the mics like over to the corner so the mic is like really badly
[22727.61s -> 22750.70s]  directions.
[22752.70s -> 22760.01s]  Does that cut down game? There's... Greg is always using AP. He doesn't go tank. He goes
[22760.01s -> 22782.48s]  like AP. I kind of want to go last stands. That's fun. I should have taken Ghost. Ghost
[22782.48s -> 22791.95s]  went so good this game. He tried to get with shield though. It's strong. Yeah, it's fun, huh?
[22793.98s -> 22798.38s]  I want to get with shield both so fun. This sort of is such a good Ghost game.
[22798.38s -> 22817.02s]  I'm frustrated. Oh, I like wasn't paying attention. I always wonder if I should go
[22817.02s -> 22824.92s]  part of me always wants to go like a long sort of three against Thresh and Zaya but with
[22824.92s -> 22831.18s]  Kaisa, I feel like you're on really specific timers with Kaisa, so you have to go like it's
[22831.18s -> 22838.16s]  really important to go Doran so that you can get the Q upgrade timer on the right, you know, like on the right timing
[22838.16s -> 22843.16s]  I've been getting the Q upgrade timers just so big.
[22843.16s -> 22847.16s]  Also this game, I feel like I go work this game.
[22847.16s -> 22848.16s]  Second.
[22848.16s -> 22850.16s]  Borker what's ends.
[22850.16s -> 22854.16s]  If Gregus is not ultra fed, I'll probably go work because I don't want to get
[22854.16s -> 22865.28s]  What's in just for Gregus.
[22865.28s -> 22875.31s]  Okay, you started Q.
[22875.31s -> 22877.31s]  Oh, Diana's starting on Wolves.
[22877.31s -> 22878.31s]  Okay.
[22878.31s -> 22884.76s]  I don't think it's a coffee after this game.
[22884.76s -> 22905.74s]  I'm getting drowsy.
[22905.74s -> 22907.94s]  I should have done the middle minion thing. I'm so bad.
[22909.50s -> 22920.14s]  Like I should have a legitimately just done the thing with the minion. So when you know if the rest starts hook, you can still play up, right?
[22920.14s -> 22940.49s]  I can play up, I can play aggressive, I'm bad.
[22941.85s -> 22943.85s]  I should have just killed the Thresh.
[22945.05s -> 22947.61s]  This is really bad man. We can't help. We can't help.
[22950.12s -> 22953.48s]  Because the way the wave is going, oh, I'm so bad. I fucked up.
[22955.67s -> 22960.23s]  It should be fine, but I still like it where it it foxes over early game
[22960.23s -> 22964.86s]  because they fucked up very badly.
[22965.86s -> 22969.86s]  Like I can't stress enough how badly they just fucked up, but it didn't matter.
[22970.86s -> 22971.86s]  Okay.
[22971.86s -> 22973.86s]  That's happening apparently.
[22974.86s -> 22977.86s]  Don't worry guys, I'm a Vesia player or Kisopire on the server.
[22978.86s -> 22979.86s]  It's me.
[22979.86s -> 22991.22s]  I'm just literally playing like dog shits.
[22991.22s -> 23006.84s]  Why I picked Kisah?
[23006.84s -> 23008.84s]  I just felt like playing her.
[23008.84s -> 23014.61s]  We got a back.
[23014.61s -> 23016.61s]  We have to leave the wave in a bad spot.
[23016.61s -> 23019.61s]  Maybe she can push it, but like we'll conquer it.
[23019.61s -> 23030.28s]  Yeah, we just, okay, we got it nice.
[23030.28s -> 23031.28s]  Not bad.
[23031.28s -> 23035.28s]  So we had to push the wave in there so that the wave will bounce back.
[23035.28s -> 23038.28s]  But we had to do it on a, it was a really bad timer.
[23038.28s -> 23041.28s]  Let me just say I fucked up the entire early game of this game.
[23041.28s -> 23043.28s]  Like this game is I'm so bad.
[23043.28s -> 23046.28s]  Essentially what should have happened was level one would they walked up.
[23046.28s -> 23049.28s]  When Kyson Thresh walked up level one, we should have killed them.
[23049.28s -> 23053.28s]  Like I should have just straight up hit the Thresh with the locks,
[23053.28s -> 23058.24s]  blocks because Thresh walked into our wave because Rukong was level two ganking. She'll just kill them.
[23058.24s -> 23064.00s]  I grieved that and because I went for the Ziya instead I put myself in a spot where I took like 80% of my HP for free
[23064.64s -> 23069.84s]  right which put me behind and now the entire fight was like harder because I was low and then
[23069.84s -> 23078.56s]  we had to wait for the way it was just it was really bad. Really that minion actually just did that.
[23082.45s -> 23086.61s]  I don't think we can kill this guy unless she can max range land a queue or something but yeah
[23086.77s -> 23093.86s]  is there the best they do right now?
[23093.86s -> 23095.86s]  uh, no, I think Jinx is better.
[23095.86s -> 23097.86s]  I think Xery is good.
[23097.86s -> 23101.86s]  Uh, her white game, especially with like paired with the Janger Xery's insane.
[23101.86s -> 23104.86s]  But I think Jinx is better for so much here.
[23106.86s -> 23108.86s]  Uh, I actually have to flash.
[23108.86s -> 23116.24s]  That was a good play hook, but I guess I respect them.
[23116.24s -> 23122.38s]  Hmm, I might have to leave because Wukong can just go here and dive me.
[23122.38s -> 23127.98s]  I actually just have to leave. This feels so bad.
[23127.98s -> 23129.98s]  You see how Wukong just used the plants?
[23129.98s -> 23133.98s]  If I stay, I can just die, right?
[23133.98s -> 23135.98s]  So I'm just misplaying all over the place.
[23135.98s -> 23137.98s]  I'm taking too much damage.
[23137.98s -> 23139.98s]  We're playing weak side right now, right?
[23139.98s -> 23143.98s]  What I mean by that is like, we know our Diana's top, and we know their Wukong's bot.
[23143.98s -> 23147.98s]  So because of that, I need to play a lot less trading.
[23147.98s -> 23149.98s]  Like, I walked up and just let the thrash fly me for free,
[23149.98s -> 23150.98s]  and I missed two waves now.
[23150.98s -> 23153.98s]  I need to not do that because if I don't miss these waves,
[23153.98s -> 23155.98s]  it doesn't matter for weak sighting because I'm not behind.
[23155.98s -> 23157.98s]  So it's, it's just really stupid.
[23157.98s -> 23169.24s]  stupid now what I do want to do is I want to go check and see if the WooCunks like on our camps or something or if he's doing dragon or some shits
[23169.24s -> 23176.98s]  I should not have used the blast cone do I am so bad
[23178.34s -> 23180.34s]  I use the blast cone to just hit it
[23180.74s -> 23184.10s]  It's playing support man. It makes your it makes your brain smaller
[23185.54s -> 23211.80s]  Actually like I swear playing support makes my brain smaller other and dragon
[23211.80s -> 23240.23s]  Desire is trolling. I think pretty sure I just freeze this no with the locks
[23240.87s -> 23251.70s]  Yeah, she's just trolling. I don't know what the fuck that was I took a little bit of damage, but
[23253.22s -> 23275.99s]  She has to over extend now
[23275.99s -> 23277.99s]  Not then okay, so
[23277.99s -> 23283.19s]  Desire wanted to back the reason that I froze that was because I once the back, but she can't back until we push the way of
[23283.99s -> 23289.43s]  Or until they push the way of in right, so it gives me time to kind of catch up on my back timer with Desire
[23289.43s -> 23292.75s]  Yeah, because I'm, you know, a little bit behind in farm.
[23292.75s -> 23303.47s]  Uh, Thresh is definitely gonna go mid here.
[23303.47s -> 23307.27s]  He's either gonna go mid or he's gonna try and hook us from the bush.
[23307.27s -> 23312.27s]  I think I'm gonna shoot my W through all the bushes here, okay?
[23312.27s -> 23314.27s]  Thresh isn't in the bushes.
[23314.27s -> 23317.27s]  He's just me, yeah, we don't know where he is.
[23317.27s -> 23321.65s]  This is awkward, because I can't really walk up.
[23321.65s -> 23324.65s]  I mean, I guess I'm almost sick, so I guess I could walk up.
[23324.65s -> 23332.54s]  Yeah, there he is, okay, we see him.
[23332.54s -> 23336.38s]  He's a little five, so it's, we could probably actually fight,
[23336.38s -> 23345.66s]  like if this guy lands a binding, I might be able to just trade.
[23345.66s -> 23350.67s]  I just, I, I'm dead.
[23350.67s -> 23351.51s]  I suck.
[23351.51s -> 23356.11s]  Honestly, I, I needed to, my bad.
[23356.11s -> 23357.47s]  I'm playing bad.
[23357.47s -> 23358.47s]  That's on me.
[23358.47s -> 23360.99s]  But Lux is playing so good.
[23360.99s -> 23362.83s]  I needed to, uh,
[23362.83s -> 23364.95s]  W, but then back up after the bind.
[23364.95s -> 23367.03s]  I'm just, I'm mechanically,
[23367.03s -> 23373.19s]  shitting on myself right now, like out of my mouth, just shit.
[23373.19s -> 23375.35s]  Because I knew exactly what was gonna happen when I used W
[23375.35s -> 23376.55s]  in front of the fucking thrashes face.
[23376.55s -> 23378.97s]  So it's like, here we go, you know what I mean?
[23379.97s -> 23381.77s]  Technically we're both six and he's five,
[23381.77s -> 23384.47s]  but he doesn't matter because if I get hooked,
[23384.47s -> 23387.81s]  I don't have enough damage, so.
[23387.81s -> 23396.15s]  Now here, I'm gonna walk up and see if I can stop
[23396.15s -> 23397.89s]  the Ziya's back, maybe.
[23397.89s -> 23401.63s]  I mean, if she's backing and a weird spot,
[23401.63s -> 23403.39s]  yeah, we stop there, backs huge.
[23403.39s -> 23404.79s]  Okay, now they're in trouble.
[23406.43s -> 23410.11s]  So they really needed to back on that timer
[23411.07s -> 23415.95s]  Because they just want to fight right and because they just want to fight they want to go back right
[23417.71s -> 23422.56s]  No way
[23422.56s -> 23426.00s]  Dude fuck off. I cannot dodge a hook right now to save my fucking life
[23427.28s -> 23430.40s]  Jesus Christ what is my movement man?
[23433.65s -> 23448.51s]  Like tilting myself right now. I want to stay for this wave, but mid is Mia. Yeah, I can't
[23448.51s -> 23456.67s]  It feels so bad because I needed one more way to get double pickaxe, so I can get my upgrade.
[23457.31s -> 23464.27s]  Because normally you go nune quiver pickaxe pickaxe. If you go nune pick pick, it gives you enough AD to get your Q upgrade, right?
[23464.27s -> 23468.43s]  And that's like the whole point. You don't need crack in, you need your Q upgrade because your Q upgrade is when you start bursting.
[23469.39s -> 23474.19s]  But because I got hooked under the turrets even though we got a kill, I had to back and I couldn't get my timer.
[23477.47s -> 23487.74s]  I'm so trash. I need some coffee. That's sort of those men.
[23487.98s -> 23489.98s]  swear to god
[23489.98s -> 23516.08s]  coffee's my savior, that'll save me.
[23520.74s -> 23522.74s]  That wave actually just did, that's my holy shit.
[23524.74s -> 23526.74s]  We don't actually do anything here, crazy.
[23539.10s -> 23540.10s]  Nice, well played.
[23558.35s -> 23560.35s]  Nice, nice, nice.
[23561.35s -> 23562.35s]  That was good to be, too.
[23562.35s -> 23572.00s]  All right, I got my queue upgrade, now we're chilling.
[23572.00s -> 23574.00s]  Oh, now we're having a chilling.
[23576.00s -> 23577.00s]  Oh, yeah, baby.
[23577.00s -> 23606.13s]  You know what it is, it's like, uh, I'm playing the fight too quick. I just got to slow down and I think I'm like too hyped up.
[23606.13s -> 23616.13s]  I really don't want to miss this wave. There's a person right there. Oh shit, let's go. Okay, he's done. Okay, I'm gonna go farm bot. Well, back I get to that.
[23616.13s -> 23640.62s]  This watch is really good. I kind of want to, oh, I can't get this point, fuck. What? What? That was BS.
[23640.62s -> 23651.24s]  I'll just take my entire HP bar really quick on the turret, it's not a big deal, guys.
[23651.24s -> 23655.24s]  I'm just I'm bad good at the game. I got on me in the brag, but like, you know,
[23655.24s -> 23657.24s]  professional gamer over here, like, you know.
[23657.24s -> 23661.74s]  I'm going to be able to want some blessings I got you.
[23661.74s -> 23673.42s]  Dude, look how big my shield is.
[23673.42s -> 23688.38s]  Wait.
[23688.38s -> 23691.38s]  You son of a bitch.
[23691.38s -> 23709.17s]  I mean, she's dead, but I got an outplay, man.
[23709.17s -> 23714.57s]  I'm not a fucker.
[23714.57s -> 23729.70s]  All right, they're for for them. Nice.
[23729.70s -> 23736.39s]  Well, I need to make some coffee. I'm playing that. Give me a sec.
[23736.39s -> 23755.93s]  We're playing real bad. I need some coffee. Nice though. We hit 400 LP. Let's go.
[23755.93s -> 23759.93s]  So now we just need 150 more. We need 550. I think 550 is GM.
[23759.93s -> 23776.25s]  I didn't do anything that game, by the way. I did nothing.
[23776.25s -> 23779.25s]  I could play another 80 carry. That was fun.
[23779.25s -> 23781.49s]  I'm going to grab some coffee. I'll be right back
[23783.01s -> 23785.81s]  talks amongst yourselves boys. I believe in you
[23787.09s -> 23790.45s]  You can look at my 80 carry tier by stuff that we've been trying to figure out how to do
[23791.33s -> 23794.29s]  enjoy. I'll be away. Grab some coffee. Oh
[23795.73s -> 23902.00s]  Fucking ass. All right. Come back. Let's go.
[23903.84s -> 23911.86s]  Sweet. Sweet back boys. We back.
[23915.49s -> 23925.29s]  Time is it five. Ooh. Hey, bring a plate for like another hour and then I got to get off and make some dinner
[23927.07s -> 23929.79s]  Do some other shit. You know, I'm saying
[23939.58s -> 23943.20s]  Where were we oh yeah, we're making the tierless. Yeah, I think various is really good a
[23944.58s -> 23946.58s]  I think versus good eight here cuz um
[23947.98s -> 23949.18s]  In my opinion
[23949.18s -> 23957.16s]  Various is never really like a bad pick almost like sometimes he's bad, but I think he's just you can play him on hit or you can play him with outie
[23957.46s -> 23962.86s]  Right, so he's got two builds that you can do based on the game and the team gump because Ulti is pretty much always useful
[23963.54s -> 23967.54s]  Like just having a stun like a route on a champion is always gonna be useful
[23967.82s -> 23972.42s]  Then you have he's got very long range like engage you can safely kill people with this
[23972.42s -> 23973.42s]  Hilton is cute
[23973.42s -> 23979.22s]  You can build him poke or like before objectives you can make pixel easily you can poke people out before the objective can blow
[23979.90s -> 23985.86s]  His lane phase is really good if you're if you understand like how to play various lane phases exceptional he also has
[23987.46s -> 23993.62s]  Uh, in the meta currently I feel like he's just like a good pick. I don't think he's as good as Draven and Jinks for SoulCube
[23994.02s -> 23996.02s]  But I do think he's really good
[23996.02s -> 24002.10s]  Um, in general. You can you can climb with him really easily and then I put ash here too
[24002.98s -> 24005.30s]  Maybe ash. I don't know who I'd put in front
[24006.82s -> 24008.18s]  Ash or Varus
[24008.18s -> 24013.38s]  I thought maybe ash or maybe Varus. I think ash is really underrated though. I think ash is super super good right now
[24025.94s -> 24027.94s]  I think ash is super good
[24027.94s -> 24034.58s]  But because, sorry, I'm trying to think, uh, she's basically the same idea as Varus.
[24034.58s -> 24036.26s]  She's a little different, but she's the same idea.
[24036.26s -> 24042.18s]  Um, she controls lane phase pretty well, Bradley her lane isn't too bad.
[24042.18s -> 24047.26s]  She also has, like, her R always useful no matter what.
[24047.26s -> 24051.18s]  So like you always have use with Ash, you always have use with Varus R, like they just
[24051.18s -> 24052.90s]  stuns, snares, etc.
[24052.90s -> 24056.50s]  And so with your, uh, she's also really good at being annoying in team fights, like you can
[24056.50s -> 24060.66s]  take Ghost on Ash and you can just voice and outside the range and if you just
[24060.66s -> 24063.94s]  speak basically solo people and she actually has decent scaling on her
[24063.94s -> 24067.62s]  crit now so you can go a bunch of builds too like I think you can go
[24067.62s -> 24071.26s]  Bork Ash you can go Crack and Slayer Ash into Bork or you could go
[24071.26s -> 24073.34s]  Crack and Slayer into IE or you can go Crack and Slayer into IE or you can go
[24073.34s -> 24075.82s]  Crack and Slayer into IE or you can go Crack and Slayer into IE or you can go
[24075.82s -> 24078.26s]  whatever you can go Shield though Ash if they have tanks you can go Gailforce
[24078.26s -> 24080.90s]  that oh you can just do a lot of different builds on Ash and I think she's
[24080.90s -> 24085.22s]  really versatile you can also just go the Onhead build if you really want I think
[24085.22s -> 24086.84s]  I think the rage-boyd build sucks, personally.
[24086.84s -> 24087.88s]  I think that if I was gonna go on,
[24087.88s -> 24088.94s]  hit, I would just be like,
[24088.94s -> 24091.32s]  shield bow, wits in, until like,
[24091.32s -> 24092.16s]  borch or some shit.
[24092.16s -> 24094.32s]  If I was actually gonna do that or shield bow,
[24094.32s -> 24096.20s]  borch or borch or borchwits or whatever.
[24096.20s -> 24102.29s]  But, yeah, I don't know.
[24102.29s -> 24103.93s]  As well as probably eight here too.
[24105.29s -> 24108.21s]  I said, as well as really gated by like skill.
[24108.21s -> 24110.09s]  So I don't wanna put them in,
[24110.09s -> 24112.09s]  I think if you could play as well perfectly,
[24112.09s -> 24113.09s]  he'd be at the top of us,
[24113.09s -> 24115.57s]  like he would just be above jinx,
[24115.57s -> 24117.37s]  just best shaving in the game
[24117.37s -> 24119.53s]  if you could never miss a skillshot,
[24119.53s -> 24121.17s]  like 100% accuracy play in perfect,
[24121.17s -> 24122.85s]  like the champs and saying, right?
[24122.85s -> 24123.93s]  It's absolutely crazy.
[24123.93s -> 24125.57s]  Oh good, that champ is if you could play in perfect.
[24125.57s -> 24128.41s]  But here, like, people are humans, et cetera.
[24128.41s -> 24130.61s]  So I think he's like an A tier pick and solo queue
[24130.61s -> 24132.89s]  because you can get countered, like, he's not blindable.
[24132.89s -> 24135.41s]  You can get countered pretty easily by good players.
[24135.41s -> 24138.57s]  People play like push comps, people play dive comps,
[24138.57s -> 24140.81s]  like early game, I mean, in lane and shit.
[24140.81s -> 24142.09s]  Like, because Ezra was lane is like,
[24142.09s -> 24144.89s]  it's not bad, but it's very difficult
[24144.89s -> 24146.49s]  to play Ezra well in lane fate.
[24146.49s -> 24148.17s]  you gotta be good mechanically.
[24148.17s -> 24149.89s]  And I don't think, even like,
[24149.89s -> 24151.09s]  I've seen like a challenger player
[24151.09s -> 24151.93s]  so you can't play as a real.
[24151.93s -> 24154.45s]  So, he's not easy.
[24155.89s -> 24169.64s]  You know what I'm saying?
[24169.64s -> 24178.17s]  What's up boys?
[24178.17s -> 24197.56s]  So, I was gonna bang Kendra, but I couldn't find her.
[24199.16s -> 24205.24s]  I hate Kendra.
[24205.24s -> 24206.80s]  Yo, how are we doing tonight?
[24206.80s -> 24226.86s]  How's everybody's day?
[24226.86s -> 24247.42s]  Okay, so this guy is picking Thresh again.
[24247.42s -> 24260.76s]  Thresh is actually pretty good in the Rakan.
[24260.76s -> 24281.32s]  They have Ziya Thresh again.
[24281.32s -> 24289.88s]  by jinx. I like jinx here. Even though it is against the rush, jinx is a little scary,
[24289.88s -> 24301.56s]  right? But I kind of like her in this situation. See what runs. Do I want free boots? No, I
[24301.56s -> 24308.87s]  think I want, uh, I want to be able to get early boots this game, because their team comp is like,
[24310.15s -> 24313.51s]  oh yeah, their team comp is really, really annoying. So I kind of want to get
[24313.51s -> 24316.59s]  It's early boots.
[24317.79s -> 24321.83s]  I'll probably go present some minds.
[24321.83s -> 24327.56s]  Although I think over Hill isn't bad.
[24327.56s -> 24328.64s]  Actually I'll go over Hill.
[24330.04s -> 24332.32s]  So yeah, these are in so good.
[24332.32s -> 24333.88s]  Actually, let's do this.
[24335.56s -> 24337.28s]  What is this?
[24337.28s -> 24343.13s]  This.
[24343.13s -> 24343.97s]  Yeah, this is good.
[24343.97s -> 24344.97s]  Okay.
[24344.97s -> 24345.81s]  I kind of like these.
[24345.81s -> 24346.65s]  This is good.
[24346.65s -> 24347.45s]  I'm gonna use these.
[24347.45s -> 24348.45s]  Okay.
[24348.45s -> 24351.09s]  I'm taking claims this game because they have
[24351.09s -> 24364.59s]  and Pantheon and Thresh, right? So with Leeson or Pantheon and Thresh, the game's gonna be like really fast of like, okay, if they stun me, I'm just gonna get CC change and I'm just gonna die after a bit, right?
[24364.59s -> 24373.20s]  It's gonna be like a stun and they're stun and they're stun and I'm just gonna die, so I'm like, nah, fuck that shit.
[24373.20s -> 24417.85s]  Let's see if we can get this double you boys. Let's see if I can not fuck up the first three levels of the win. Got you, right? Oh yeah.
[24417.85s -> 24419.85s]  It's for a while.
[24419.85s -> 24429.08s]  It's Riot's secret code to make it so I could actually play the game and climb without chatting.
[24429.08s -> 24448.67s]  Okay.
[24448.67s -> 24451.67s]  I should have warded this bush.
[24451.67s -> 24455.67s]  I was drinking my coffee, I didn't think about it.
[24455.67s -> 24459.67s]  But yeah, if you guys are against the hook champ, always ward this bush.
[24459.67s -> 24468.65s]  Right right here, you're going to want to ward here early against the most hook champions.
[24468.65s -> 24478.65s]  because it gives you a very nice, like they can't walk in here in cheesy, they can't walk in here in cheesy, so you just don't get cheesed by anything.
[24478.65s -> 24512.22s]  I mean, that's just, I don't even know what I just saw.
[24512.22s -> 24516.22s]  I'll be real, I don't know what the fuck just happened, but okay.
[24516.22s -> 24519.22s]  Trying to push this way of as fast as I can.
[24519.22s -> 24539.70s]  Not sure I can actually get it pushed fast enough, but we're gonna try. It was close.
[24539.70s -> 24542.90s]  No, I'm gonna let it just, well, it's not a huge deal.
[24544.02s -> 24545.22s]  It was very close though.
[24546.18s -> 24547.46s]  We can just break the freeze, right?
[24547.46s -> 24548.34s]  Like, it's not a huge deal.
[24552.20s -> 24553.40s]  Are they supposed to win the level one?
[24554.28s -> 24557.56s]  It depends. I mean, Ziya's not that good level one.
[24557.56s -> 24561.16s]  Like, she Ziya's good because she has her feathers, right?
[24561.16s -> 24562.84s]  But if you can't stack your feathers of a one,
[24562.84s -> 24564.12s]  Jinx has more damage.
[24564.92s -> 24567.24s]  And they stacked up for my gap or for my rocket.
[24567.24s -> 24569.96s]  So I got like, I've full stacked my lethal tempo,
[24569.96s -> 24577.02s]  And I just double a we rocketed them over and over and over and over again rent and so
[24577.74s -> 24580.70s]  When they finally all went they were just behind an HP
[24581.98s -> 24584.22s]  Also a Thresh missed he only had a fly
[24610.55s -> 24612.87s]  Damn that was so close man
[24613.91s -> 24634.10s]  Like actually if the Ratchet died there we're not Thresh it graves died there we just win the game
[24648.65s -> 24650.97s]  Yeah, this isn't good. Oh, I'm gonna get flight. I'm dead
[24650.97s -> 24655.13s]  maybe maybe I'm not done I have to walk up like this
[24657.13s -> 24660.33s]  it was a really bad fight by the what what am I watching with the fuck
[24662.17s -> 24667.61s]  that was the bad fight because um we knew graves was bought and we knew that
[24667.61s -> 24673.77s]  he was gonna kill in the jungle right so my jungler already got out played by graves once
[24673.77s -> 24678.17s]  tops on you shouldn't ever take another fight like that bot side you should just take the
[24678.17s -> 24681.81s]  the win right like I rotated now granted the
[24681.81s -> 24683.93s]  Recon should have been there to help kill the
[24683.93s -> 24686.89s]  graves like when I rotated Rakan was still
[24686.89s -> 24689.37s]  jacking off in line right like when I was
[24689.37s -> 24691.61s]  here Rakan was like way down here so the
[24691.61s -> 24695.17s]  support should have rotated first right like
[24695.17s -> 24696.69s]  I rotated but the support should have been
[24696.69s -> 24699.29s]  the one rotating but again he's just a lot of
[24699.29s -> 24700.85s]  the time you have support players who don't
[24700.85s -> 24702.37s]  understand timers and I had to help
[24702.37s -> 24704.85s]  jump nobody plays for jungle so four players
[24704.85s -> 24711.81s]  hate playing for jungle in low elo. So it's just not a thing. So I tried to go over and
[24711.81s -> 24719.01s]  help him, but I misplaced my traps a little bit. And then the graves had a flash, but he
[24719.01s -> 24726.25s]  got away. And they tried to go in again when I was too low to actually help. We just got
[24726.25s -> 24734.07s]  lucky we didn't lose the game off that shit. Kind of does suck those. I was really strong
[24734.07s -> 24752.79s]  No, not bad. I should know oh, I should have I could have killed her
[24754.23s -> 24759.34s]  I suppose I could have killed the guy. No joke. I told I could have killed him
[24760.62s -> 24768.42s]  If I had warded the lantern as you tried to take it I would have killed the Ziya because she egoed the lantern there
[24778.30s -> 24782.30s]  She egoed the lantern so hard if I had if I had warded it she dies there
[24783.58s -> 24797.18s]  It's my bed this game's really interesting because
[24797.18s -> 24803.54s]  the enemy ball veins actually misplaying a lot like they're really really really
[24803.54s -> 24811.14s]  misplaying these fights and trades and shit but we can't abuse it because the
[24811.14s -> 24814.54s]  graves have so much control of the game right now that we have to basically
[24814.54s -> 24818.50s]  play safe permanently at the moment and I can't do anything to help my team
[24818.50s -> 24820.50s]  it feels really bad.
[24820.50s -> 24836.70s]  Oh, my cousin, yeah, there we go.
[24836.70s -> 24838.50s]  See, little graves in the bottom again, man.
[24838.50s -> 24848.65s]  This is so rough.
[24848.65s -> 24853.66s]  Graves just min.
[24853.66s -> 24865.58s]  I want to kill this, it's fast as I can.
[24865.58s -> 24871.50s]  We can fight these guys too, too, actually.
[24871.50s -> 24882.08s]  Wait, why didn't you just go in?
[24882.08s -> 24884.72s]  I don't know why he didn't just double you immediately.
[24884.72s -> 24887.72s]  Like, they were convaded, all that tells me.
[24887.72s -> 24889.84s]  Like, when she was against the wall here,
[24889.84s -> 24894.28s]  he should have immediately doubled her.
[24894.28s -> 24897.76s]  Because if he w's from vision there, right?
[24897.76s -> 24903.36s]  and she's against the wall. It helps us so much. Because then I can overlay my flame
[24903.36s -> 24908.64s]  chunks on top of the, uh, I can overlay my flame chunks directly on top of the Zaya,
[24909.44s -> 24914.64s]  right as the fights happening rather than like having to work around the fight because the
[24914.64s -> 24922.54s]  rushes in my face type shit, you know. So we're honestly just losing because we're not pulling
[24922.54s -> 24931.42s]  the trigger fast enough. And we can't play aggressive when we can pull the trigger, right? Like
[24931.42s -> 24935.42s]  We're losing because we can't pull the trigger fast enough, and when we can't pull the trigger, it's the wrong time.
[24938.38s -> 24940.38s]  We do this right now. We get dragon.
[24940.38s -> 24942.38s]  The bot lane back, we get dragon here.
[24948.91s -> 24952.91s]  I want to go, uh, I actually want to go.
[24952.91s -> 24957.44s]  Wait, the enemy bot lane didn't back.
[24958.44s -> 24959.44s]  Okay, they're trolling.
[24959.44s -> 24965.42s]  They lost an objective for free here. This is really good.
[24965.42s -> 24969.42s]  So the enemy bot lane, we fight this by the way. We just, we can just straight up fight.
[24969.42s -> 24982.60s]  That right there is how you land, are you mortal, answered by the way?
[24983.60s -> 24987.16s]  Oh, I did that guy so dirty.
[24987.16s -> 24992.92s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[24992.92s -> 24993.60s]  Bye guys.
[24993.60s -> 25004.53s]  I didn't know Pantheon was me, that was my bad.
[25004.53s -> 25007.17s]  I was like, I was too happy with warning the lantern.
[25007.17s -> 25010.16s]  Bye, man.
[25010.16s -> 25018.56s]  I can't believe the enemy team greeted that hard though for gold.
[25018.56s -> 25024.13s]  Oh, that's actually nuts to me.
[25024.13s -> 25036.54s]  No, yeah, the Ziya's egoing, like, crazy.
[25036.54s -> 25041.54s]  The problem is I can't abuse it constantly because like obviously like I need teammates, right?
[25042.54s -> 25047.54s]  I can kind of abuse it like, uh, but it's much harder by yourself.
[25051.77s -> 25056.77s]  Because as you can see, like I'm not playing poorly, but we're getting like, we're getting shit on.
[25057.77s -> 25077.29s]  Shit on's a bad word. We're getting like, Oh, come on man.
[25078.29s -> 25088.77s]  They misplayed that so badly, but we're con just ate the fucking whatever.
[25088.77s -> 25094.97s]  Whatever, I'm not gonna blame McCon it's fine. I'm so sad about that though. They misplayed that so incredibly badly
[25096.25s -> 25098.25s]  Like so badly
[25098.41s -> 25103.65s]  It was just that like Rekhon all in the thrash with his ultimate, but all he had to do there was
[25104.57s -> 25110.49s]  Use his E to come back to me and then play front to back afterward, but he's the he's that they're autoing the thrash
[25111.45s -> 25115.65s]  But you don't need the auto him you just need to engage and then I can maybe play on after it
[25115.65s -> 25126.58s]  I probably could have double killed them there too. I kind of messed up. My team wants out
[25127.94s -> 25130.74s]  It's not it's it's silly because the game's not even over
[25134.71s -> 25137.35s]  Like we actually can win this game so incredibly easily
[25138.35s -> 25143.15s]  So easily if we just play it correctly because their ball-in is really fucking bad
[25143.15s -> 25147.93s]  I didn't want to be mean, but I'll just be mean their ball-in's really fucking bad
[25155.34s -> 25158.14s]  Well, I'm dead. They're still bad
[25158.14s -> 25166.94s]  I'm just egoing. That was my ego. I still stand by it. I still think they're bad.
[25166.94s -> 25173.10s]  This is point one B3 mid. The threat has not been mid one time. So it must be the top
[25173.10s -> 25187.00s]  winner. I'm so frustrated right now with this game. Because I feel like we should have
[25187.00s -> 25191.80s]  won so many all-ins that we didn't win. Barely like one like barely, right? Like barely
[25191.80s -> 25194.52s]  We didn't win small ends. I thought we should have won all of them
[25196.68s -> 25200.68s]  Like they they didn't land like a good all-in once. Thresh didn't land a single hook once
[25202.28s -> 25207.36s]  And this is my recon like he just tried to he just used his R to try and engage
[25208.08s -> 25214.98s]  I think nocturn is done mentally
[25219.23s -> 25221.23s]  Okay, so in games like this
[25223.13s -> 25249.27s]  Like this threat is so bad. Oh, let's go, baby
[25249.27s -> 25278.56s]  huge. That was so huge. Let's fucking go. Like I, I'm going to hit no at 15 because
[25278.56s -> 25284.56s]  dude, I really don't want to lose to this thrash in the Ziya. Like this thrash is doing the most,
[25284.56s -> 25290.56s]  the most ego shit I've ever seen. And he's just getting away with shit. Like right there,
[25290.56s -> 25297.56s]  thrash walks up with every spell and expects to get away with that shit. No, no, no, we win
[25297.56s -> 25300.80s]  We win these trust. Give me let me cook let me cook. I
[25301.76s -> 25303.48s]  See my team to let me cook a bit, you know
[25304.60s -> 25308.96s]  Like we had a batter again had a point week side. Let me cook. Let me cook
[25310.48s -> 25343.74s]  We are chillin
[25343.74s -> 25375.14s]  If I landed that that would have been sick the rest is top two we can kill this guy
[25375.66s -> 25385.30s]  Come on guys don't forfeit
[25385.30s -> 25387.78s]  Guys the game is winnable. Oh my god
[25388.98s -> 25392.34s]  Dude the game is how is the raccoon gonna forfeit?
[25392.34s -> 25398.34s]  Dude, that game is so winnable and hurts.
[25398.34s -> 25407.46s]  Ah, like dude, really.
[25407.46s -> 25413.40s]  That actually is so infuriating.
[25413.40s -> 25415.72s]  That's so infuriating, man.
[25415.72s -> 25418.44s]  That game was so incredibly winnable.
[25418.44s -> 25421.79s]  Like look at this.
[25421.79s -> 25423.75s]  I did more damage than every single player
[25423.75s -> 25425.63s]  on the enemy team.
[25425.63s -> 25430.31s]  If my team just relaxed, we win the game
[25430.31s -> 25433.27s]  a thousand times over that game.
[25433.27s -> 25434.51s]  Like the game is over.
[25436.07s -> 25438.71s]  We have a racon, a rumble, and a woocon for me
[25438.71s -> 25440.67s]  to sit in, sit behind.
[25440.67s -> 25443.35s]  And we saw how bad their bot lane was, right?
[25443.35s -> 25447.45s]  I have plans for the only way they can kill me.
[25447.45s -> 25450.17s]  I have a man, I wish to God, I'm a reporter, mall.
[25450.17s -> 25453.29s]  Like these fuckers, I guarantee I get a notification.
[25453.29s -> 25457.54s]  There's no way these people are not toxic.
[25457.54s -> 25460.10s]  There's no way you, this, like, you just want out
[25460.10s -> 25463.94s]  of a game after a fucking, your team is just doing well.
[25463.94s -> 25468.94s]  No, man, the score is 10 to 14.
[25468.94s -> 25471.94s]  10 to 14.
[25471.94s -> 25481.14s]  You have a Fed 80 carry.
[25481.14s -> 25482.14s]  Look at this.
[25482.14s -> 25483.14s]  Dude, we forfeited.
[25483.14s -> 25488.22s]  We were down 2.5K.
[25488.22s -> 25491.22s]  We had a better scaling comp than them.
[25491.22s -> 25494.22s]  Like, we outscale them.
[25494.22s -> 25496.22s]  We have two dragons.
[25496.22s -> 25498.22s]  We outscale them.
[25498.22s -> 25510.30s]  and we're down 2.5K and my team rage hits forfeit, oh my god that's so gross that
[25510.30s -> 25529.12s]  is so disgusting, so disgusting. Why am I in a game with this player? I'm
[25529.12s -> 25540.84s]  412 LP Masters. I was in a game just now with a 7 LP Masters jungler and he's not on a
[25540.84s -> 25550.55s]  smurf. This is not a smurf account. Because last season this guy was D4. So he's not on a smurf.
[25551.35s -> 25562.90s]  Why is this player in my game? Why is this player in a 400 LP Master game? Why? Or rather why I'm
[25562.90s -> 25569.77s]  I in a diamond one game.
[25569.77s -> 25571.29s]  You can go to his previous games.
[25571.29s -> 25573.61s]  He doesn't even have good MMR.
[25573.61s -> 25574.57s]  Like if you look at these games,
[25574.57s -> 25578.17s]  they're all like what, 100, 200 LP, right?
[25578.17s -> 25579.57s]  Why am I in this game?
[25579.57s -> 25583.21s]  Why did you put me in a game with this player?
[25583.21s -> 25585.61s]  Like this guy, I don't really care if he sucks.
[25585.61s -> 25588.45s]  I'm more frustrated the fact that these players
[25588.45s -> 25591.25s]  mental boom at the first sign of any negativity.
[25591.25s -> 25591.93s]  Look at this.
[25593.01s -> 25594.01s]  They just give up.
[25594.01s -> 25596.57s]  First sign of anything negative, they go next.
[25596.57s -> 25602.49s]  Like, I actually could have won B9 to this game too, like actually, but I'm not allowed
[25602.49s -> 25607.97s]  to try in one B9 because my team once out of the game had fucking four minutes, or 15 minutes.
[25607.97s -> 25610.73s]  That sucks, man.
[25610.73s -> 25618.57s]  The new system is trash, like I'm sorry, but the four-fifth 15 system is good sometimes.
[25618.57s -> 25622.41s]  They should have a requirement that you have to be losing by X amount of gold for it to
[25622.41s -> 25624.21s]  kick in.
[25624.21s -> 25626.13s]  That should be it.
[25626.13s -> 25627.77s]  They should have a requirement.
[25627.77s -> 25634.42s]  You have to be losing by 5K plus for it to work at 15.
[25634.42s -> 25639.10s]  Like there needs to be something where there's a requirement
[25639.10s -> 25641.86s]  because people are so stupid, right?
[25641.86s -> 25643.94s]  Like that game was 100% ours.
[25643.94s -> 25648.22s]  We had two dragons, we're down 2000 gold at 16 minutes.
[25648.22s -> 25650.54s]  And WooCone's 3 and 1.
[25650.54s -> 25651.82s]  We've done four kills.
[25651.82s -> 25657.06s]  WooCone's 3 and 1.
[25657.06s -> 25660.54s]  I'm literally insanely strong.
[25660.54s -> 25663.54s]  Even though we got weeks ahead, I'm still winning.
[25663.54s -> 25665.54s]  We just two of you two, the bots out of the map, right?
[25665.54s -> 25667.54s]  Wait, we just wanted to be two.
[25667.54s -> 25672.54s]  Rumble's just like, like, ah, sorry, I'm just mad.
[25672.54s -> 25673.54s]  I'm mad.
[25673.54s -> 25676.54s]  But they need to require, they need to require something
[25676.54s -> 25678.54s]  other than four people, like require four people
[25678.54s -> 25681.54s]  and a gold lead or something. Like that's so cancer.
[25681.54s -> 25686.94s]  That's so fucking frustrating, man.
[25686.94s -> 25691.96s]  Like I can't believe how bad people's mental's are.
[25691.96s -> 25697.40s]  Like the, okay, I get it. The, the rumble and the, the rumble and the, the rumble and the
[25697.40s -> 25701.20s]  nocturn, I understand wanting to forfeit, okay. Okay. Okay. They're having a bad game.
[25701.20s -> 25705.64s]  They want out the raging. They need to get their frustration. I get it. But why are we forfeiting
[25705.64s -> 25716.40s]  when Wukong is three and one? I have seven of our KP. I'm the 80 carry. I'm very, I just got my
[25716.40s -> 25722.40s]  mythic, we have two dragons. And we're concentrating to, I don't know, man.
[25724.24s -> 25735.84s]  Ah, that's just frustrating. It's all like I'll be real. I carry this game every day of the week.
[25737.44s -> 25768.39s]  Every day of the week I carry those. So apparently Riot is doing something about smurfing, though,
[25769.35s -> 25775.03s]  and I can't wait until they do. This is actually a really good thing that I wanted to
[25775.03s -> 25776.43s]  that I wanted to talk about earlier in the stream,
[25776.43s -> 25777.71s]  but I forgot.
[25777.71s -> 25779.95s]  Apparently Riot is doing something to make
[25779.95s -> 25780.83s]  smurfing harder,
[25780.83s -> 25783.83s]  because apparently smurfing is outrageous right now.
[25783.83s -> 25788.59s]  And I kind of think that they need to stop this too.
[25788.59s -> 25792.27s]  So there's a thing you can do in solo queue right now,
[25792.27s -> 25796.15s]  where you can make a new account,
[25796.15s -> 25797.87s]  and you can do it with somebody
[25799.11s -> 25802.27s]  on different accounts on a new account,
[25802.27s -> 25809.15s]  And your MMR doesn't actually get, like, lowered.
[25809.15s -> 25812.71s]  So if you win a game, let's say you win a game.
[25816.23s -> 25817.63s]  I think this is just him leveling me account,
[25817.63s -> 25819.63s]  but let's say you win a game.
[25819.63s -> 25824.48s]  And in that game, you do all with somebody
[25824.48s -> 25826.40s]  and a lower MMR, right?
[25826.40s -> 25828.24s]  Now, when you do all in a lower MMR,
[25828.24s -> 25829.56s]  I don't know if this guy did this or not,
[25829.56s -> 25831.76s]  but when you do all somebody in a lower MMR,
[25831.76s -> 25835.04s]  your MMR is based on now the game
[25835.04s -> 25840.00s]  thinks that you're in that MMR and you can do it in placements. So in your very first
[25840.00s -> 25845.36s]  games for some reason, there's no MMR lock on placements. So you can in your placements,
[25846.88s -> 25852.96s]  do all with somebody who's like bronze, right? And you can play with them. And then the game
[25852.96s -> 25858.48s]  thinks you're still winning, so it keeps amplifying your MMR. So when it's I'm describing this
[25858.48s -> 25862.56s]  really poorly, but essentially you can do all in lower e-lose and the game doesn't know your
[25862.56s -> 25867.60s]  your MMR bonds in that yellow, because you're winning in that yellow, the game can't
[25867.60s -> 25873.68s]  figure that out for some reason, the algorithm. So, when they stop dook-ywing, it's still
[25873.68s -> 25878.32s]  inflated them, it's still inflated their MMR to where it would be if they had so low-cute.
[25879.12s -> 25883.92s]  Does that make sense? And what I'm saying? So it basically says that they went like 10 and
[25883.92s -> 25890.16s]  no in their placements, right? So now they're in like a master tier MMR from a brand new account.
[25890.16s -> 25897.16s]  So now those people are in like D1 Masters MMR, but they played they they one in gold.
[25897.16s -> 25909.79s]  I also don't think you smurfing should be so easily accessible.
[25909.79s -> 25913.79s]  Like this guy's not a bad player per se, but I don't think he's a master to a player.
[25913.79s -> 25916.79s]  Right? Like this guy's a rumble player on a new account.
[25916.79s -> 25920.79s]  From that game alone, the fact he gave up tells me he's not a good player.
[25920.79s -> 25943.57s]  Dude, I'm a head the advocate or for like,
[25943.57s -> 25947.57s]  Riot, you have to attach like a verification to your accounts.
[25949.17s -> 25953.33s]  I know Riot would never do that, but I'm like a heavy advocate for like having to attach
[25953.33s -> 25962.92s]  verification to play ranked. I think it'd be great, honestly. I think it would help so much.
[25974.95s -> 25978.87s]  If you're very, very account-vander you're done for it. Yeah, you have to get like a VPN
[25978.87s -> 25984.47s]  to play other than like you would have to. That's my point though. Like, if you get your
[25984.47s -> 26007.40s]  find account bands, right? Like, okay, that counts done. Like I said, I don't think
[26007.40s -> 26012.88s]  Riot would ever do it because it's too extreme and I don't think Riot has the balls
[26012.88s -> 26017.72s]  to ever do that shit. VPM's only $5. Yeah, but dude, are you going to tell me that
[26017.72s -> 26023.60s]  you're going to buy people who get banned on accounts, typically get banned consistently,
[26023.60s -> 26029.24s]  that's why they're making spurs. Right? So you're telling me somebody's going to be willing
[26029.24s -> 26035.02s]  to pay $5 for a new phone number, verification or whatever, every time they have to make
[26035.02s -> 26049.32s]  a new account, they're not, not you me.
[26049.32s -> 26051.72s]  Lulu, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[26051.72s -> 26052.72s]  Don't I have swirfs?
[26052.72s -> 26053.72s]  Yeah, I do.
[26053.72s -> 26060.40s]  And I stand by all my swirfs should be attached to the same like account, like if you make
[26060.40s -> 26064.56s]  a smurf, okay, this is what I think should happen.
[26064.56s -> 26067.52s]  You should be able to put all of your swirfs on one account.
[26067.52s -> 26073.84s]  So you can make Smurfs, and you can add that Smurfs verification to an account.
[26073.84s -> 26075.64s]  But it kind of like battle.net.
[26075.64s -> 26076.64s]  Does that make sense?
[26076.64s -> 26080.48s]  You know, like battle.net has all your accounts in the battle.net thing, but you can sign
[26080.48s -> 26082.16s]  in the battle.net.
[26082.16s -> 26087.52s]  I think that the way to make it viable would be like, you could put all, if you didn't
[26087.52s -> 26091.60s]  have a second phone number, didn't want one, you could put Smurfs up to like a limit.
[26091.60s -> 26095.20s]  So you could have like three Smurfs or like two Smurfs in your main account, right?
[26095.20s -> 26097.38s]  So you could have like three total accounts.
[26097.38s -> 26099.10s]  And you would have to like,
[26099.10s -> 26100.78s]  you could add those to the same like,
[26100.78s -> 26102.88s]  oh, Omega account, right?
[26102.88s -> 26105.42s]  And that Omega account could be your verified account.
[26105.42s -> 26107.50s]  Now, if any of your accounts get punished
[26107.50s -> 26115.28s]  on your Omega account, all of your accounts get punished.
[26115.28s -> 26116.60s]  So if any of your accounts get punished,
[26116.60s -> 26130.02s]  all of them get punished.
[26130.02s -> 26132.26s]  But I feel like that'd be a good play.
[26132.26s -> 26134.26s]  Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like it would work.
[26134.26s -> 26135.50s]  Yo, what's up, Rush?
[26135.50s -> 26140.99s]  I call you Rush, what's up, Rush?
[26140.99s -> 26142.55s]  Oh, what do I wanna play?
[26142.55s -> 26151.40s]  I don't know, I don't know what I want to do here, it's up to the range, okay.
[26151.40s -> 26156.88s]  I wish I didn't have cleanse, cleanse is so worthless this game, like actually.
[26156.88s -> 26159.40s]  Plans does nothing this game at all.
[26159.40s -> 26164.68s]  I just down a sum, like maybe if the brand like tries to flash done me or some shit,
[26164.68s -> 26178.78s]  but I'm just like down a sum, and I'm gonna...
[26178.78s -> 26192.39s]  Alright, boys, we got night blue three on our team, there's a throwback.
[26192.39s -> 26248.89s]  and
[26248.89s -> 26258.30s]  oh, we got him. I'm not gonna lie. I kind of looked like I was scripting
[26260.14s -> 26264.06s]  That that movement like if I was watching the game, I'd be like what the fuck was that?
[26266.06s -> 26268.06s]  Like my movement was real sauce
[26268.70s -> 26273.74s]  Well on that like that all-in right there. That's some that's some sauce movement
[26305.67s -> 26308.63s]  We can gank these guys. They have no oh, there's gonna be a ward in here
[26318.98s -> 26320.98s]  These people have no flashes
[26321.14s -> 26325.14s]  and we bought land has no flash, this should be a free kill honestly
[26326.14s -> 26330.14s]  we just let these guys push in, they can't walk up and we just play for that
[26334.82s -> 26338.82s]  even if they try and 3v3, we should just win the 3v3 because we're stronger
[26338.82s -> 26347.45s]  oh this guy is just dead, yeah, that's...
[26358.14s -> 26360.14s]  I need level 3
[26360.14s -> 26365.54s]  I kind of fucked my entire way of here
[26365.54s -> 26367.54s]  yeah, can we push?
[26367.54s -> 26371.24s]  is there any way we can just push this?
[26371.24s -> 26378.61s]  ooh nice
[26378.61s -> 26391.62s]  Nice, well-played.
[26391.62s -> 26393.62s]  Last job.
[26393.62s -> 26396.62s]  My blue glues, fucking fetish shit.
[26396.62s -> 26406.76s]  Oh, I should have gone free boots this game.
[26406.76s -> 26408.76s]  I didn't even think about it.
[26408.76s -> 26413.76s]  Because I don't need Sork this game.
[26413.76s -> 26415.76s]  You know how the last game I told you I was going boots.
[26415.76s -> 26420.76s]  I went boots for the, you know, the fast boot to rush for Thresh.
[26420.76s -> 26425.62s]  I don't need that this game because we just went through like faster mythic
[26426.12s -> 26432.84s]  So I should have gone three boots for like more efficiency
[26439.96s -> 26443.56s]  Okay, I'm just stand knock just kill a man
[26444.64s -> 26448.60s]  You can't understand now just kill a man
[26449.32s -> 26470.87s]  I want to push this way
[26471.03s -> 26473.03s]  So we don't get like shit on
[26473.35s -> 26502.01s]  I'm just killing man
[26502.65s -> 26504.65s]  You can't understand
[26504.65s -> 26507.25s]  and just kill a man.
[26511.29s -> 26513.53s]  Kill a man, there is something
[26513.53s -> 26515.25s]  on dust stand.
[26516.33s -> 26544.13s]  Kill a man.
[26544.13s -> 26546.29s]  Hmm, I could go back here, but
[26547.29s -> 26548.89s]  I don't see any reason to go back yet.
[26558.82s -> 26559.70s]  I think I'm dead.
[26564.40s -> 26566.72s]  Ooh, I misplied that.
[26566.72s -> 26567.88s]  That was actually really good by the way,
[26567.88s -> 26568.52s]  like cool dance.
[26568.52s -> 26569.84s]  No, you're fine, man.
[26569.84s -> 26571.56s]  I wish I could, I wish I could tell him
[26571.56s -> 26572.76s]  that he played it fine.
[26572.76s -> 26573.96s]  I messed up, not him.
[26573.96s -> 26576.34s]  I messed up.
[26576.34s -> 26584.67s]  I feel bad. I want to like say no you're fine because that was my bad
[26584.67s -> 26589.07s]  I should have okay, so when I flashed and I was running away from the twitch right?
[26589.07s -> 26592.67s]  The second that twitch flashed on me. I should have instantly started autoing him
[26593.39s -> 26598.51s]  Like I and it was one extra auto like one single extra auto and it would have been fine
[26602.02s -> 26607.92s]  Why can't I tell her you know, I just choose not to type anymore
[26608.96s -> 26620.59s]  To my choice, you know, yeah my choice
[26620.59s -> 26641.40s]  I guess actually doing that, huh?
[26641.40s -> 26646.71s]  We went to V2 really fucking hard.
[26646.71s -> 26650.01s]  Especially with Tier 2 boots, but I need to...
[26650.01s -> 26667.06s]  Dude, I'm doing some scripty shit.
[26667.06s -> 26669.06s]  I don't know, you real.
[26669.06s -> 26675.82s]  Dude, Louis, Louis wasn't six.
[26675.82s -> 26677.82s]  I thought she was six.
[26677.82s -> 26678.82s]  I'm so bad.
[26678.82s -> 26683.84s]  I wish I could tell her my bad again.
[26683.84s -> 26685.84s]  I'm actually trolling.
[26685.84s -> 26688.84s]  Like, I ran out of mana because I'm bad.
[26688.84s -> 26690.84s]  And then I
[26693.26s -> 26699.30s]  And then I thought she was six so I walked up to like take tank the turret for a second, right because I was like, oh shit
[26699.30s -> 26704.46s]  Maybe I'll get like we can kill this guy. Maybe Louis has a spell or something. I just oh, I played bad my bad
[26710.56s -> 26711.96s]  W then make sure
[26711.96s -> 26722.83s]  Akra is not there. I feel I actually just feel so bad because the movie was actually playing really it's like the best support of how to all that
[26723.51s -> 26725.31s]  Like this guy's actually impressing me, right?
[26725.91s -> 26727.91s]  Like this guy's playing really well
[26727.91s -> 26767.16s]  And I'm just griefing move gave her life for me move gave her life for me boys
[26767.76s -> 26772.46s]  Can we get a a salute for Lulu and chat boys?
[26773.50s -> 26778.16s]  We get a salute. Can we get some blog per Lulu?
[26780.00s -> 26788.18s]  She gave her life for the homey
[26804.05s -> 26807.05s]  Honestly, that was a really cool to be too, by the way. Oh
[26808.89s -> 26812.61s]  Night was smurfing at what the fuck you killed that bitch, too
[26829.47s -> 26840.21s]  Nice
[26840.21s -> 26842.21s]  No, oh
[26843.17s -> 26846.71s]  But lost that cannon. I would have lost my life in game
[26876.55s -> 26879.15s]  I'm gonna go beaty second item. We have blue blue
[26879.83s -> 26881.83s]  So wait what the fuck is this path thing?
[26883.07s -> 26888.41s]  I click to go bot and it passed me in the weirdest spot ever. We have blue blue so I could actually go i-e second
[26888.41s -> 26891.31s]  But I think if I go bt I'll be actually uncutable
[26892.71s -> 26894.71s]  Like it'll be the greatest thing ever
[26894.71s -> 26956.58s]  I actually still might go IE as I'm thinking about it out loud by saying we have Louis Vu and not be stupid but hey, I guess I still might, you know, I still might go IE but I don't know yet, we'll see, because I took a lacquerity, so it's like, wow, no over to that, I mean I don't know why I flashed away, I'm playing bad, that's my fault.
[26956.58s -> 26961.62s]  I think the game's over so I'm just I'm playing bad. I'm like lemme test thing a little bit too much
[26972.59s -> 26993.44s]  today
[27029.50s -> 27042.35s]  Bammer
[27055.55s -> 27058.19s]  Probably they haven't for but in though with the fuck dude
[27058.83s -> 27062.99s]  How does this game? Oh, I'm even more mad you guys have no idea
[27064.27s -> 27066.27s]  So I
[27066.27s -> 27074.17s]  it's 24 to eight the enemy team doesn't forfeit but my team forfeets when the score is 10 to 14
[27074.17s -> 27099.07s]  and we're only down a thousand golds sorry I was that was my bad I was tilted by
[27099.07s -> 27105.54s]  you know I was thinking about about how they weren't forfeeting and I was getting mad
[27105.54s -> 27111.08s]  it is a little interesting because I said they still can't win so I don't know who the
[27111.08s -> 27114.28s]  box setting no but it's probably echo well no echo is definitely heading
[27114.28s -> 27123.53s]  no but like who else maybe brand maybe ribbon it ribbon's like yeah
[27123.53s -> 27137.40s]  they just get a thousand gold alright I should probably stop throwing I'd feel
[27137.40s -> 27141.00s]  pretty silly if we lost because I'm bad after we like dumbstead of
[27141.00s -> 27143.96s]  laying that hard I feel pretty silly if we lost because I keep getting
[27143.96s -> 27167.00s]  caught alright I should be unkillable now like I'm not even farming I'm I'm
[27167.00s -> 27169.00s]  I'm actually griefing.
[27169.00s -> 27171.00s]  I should probably go make dinner after this game.
[27171.00s -> 27174.00s]  I want to keep playing because I'm playing well today, but I did.
[27174.00s -> 27178.00s]  My brain is starting to go like, I probably need to go make some food.
[27178.00s -> 27181.00s]  I'm getting the full ADHD brain experience going.
[27181.00s -> 27196.13s]  So let's see if I can muster all my focus.
[27196.13s -> 27202.87s]  Let's see if I can muster up all my focus really quick.
[27202.87s -> 27205.87s]  Just for push out and finish this game.
[27205.87s -> 27212.49s]  We'll go terminate our mode for the end of this game right now.
[27212.49s -> 27215.49s]  We'll muster up all of the focus.
[27215.49s -> 27225.71s]  DEM modengaged voice.
[27225.71s -> 27227.71s]  God, that sounded really cringe.
[27227.71s -> 27278.83s]  I'm actually really impressed though.
[27278.83s -> 27280.45s]  I played this game really really well.
[27280.45s -> 27283.76s]  Like, I'll be honest.
[27283.76s -> 27288.96s]  My last thought of Night Blue was him being bad at League.
[27288.96s -> 27294.95s]  He played this game really well.
[27294.95s -> 27296.95s]  My man's gotten so much better.
[27296.95s -> 27304.48s]  Okay, nobody saw that.
[27304.48s -> 27307.98s]  Nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that.
[27307.98s -> 27308.98s]  Nobody saw that.
[27308.98s -> 27310.98s]  Nobody saw that, nobody saw that.
[27310.98s -> 27323.86s]  Not one of you saw me flash after the echo. I didn't want to be wasted flash. No, that was assertive flash.
[27324.86s -> 27326.86s]  An assertive dominant flash.
[27327.86s -> 27329.86s]  Not wasted at all.
[27329.86s -> 27339.26s]  They might actually go for Baron here. We should look for this.
[27340.26s -> 27342.26s]  Oh, they could try. Oh, he's here.
[27349.70s -> 27351.70s]  Pretty sure the ribbon's here too, though.
[27352.70s -> 27355.70s]  Yep. I did not mean to do that.
[27355.70s -> 27361.90s]  I didn't mean to hit the thing. I accidentally hit the blast plants. That was that was an accident.
[27361.90s -> 27370.89s]  It was a literal pure accident. Like I did not mean to hit it. I was like I know
[27370.89s -> 27375.25s]  ribbons here. I'm going to wait for Yasuo before I go over. Or before I do this right and
[27375.25s -> 27380.01s]  I'm going to bat him. And I just completely whiffed every like I'm bad. We'll leave it
[27380.01s -> 27385.21s]  at I'm bad. That's a good way to put I'm bad. I'm hungry. I'm old. I'm bald. I'm bad. Nothing
[27385.21s -> 27407.11s]  else to say. Short, too. Short and mad. Yeah, that was a pedestrian flash. It is
[27407.11s -> 27417.16s]  too as well. Oh yeah, it's a plottera, a plottera of terrible things. I still got to go
[27417.16s -> 27449.77s]  to the gym tonight too. It's bad. Okay. I'm a little nervous about getting flanked, right?
[27449.77s -> 27472.12s]  Their junglers could just like sit in places. Nice. We got top in him. Not bad. Yeah,
[27472.12s -> 27474.12s]  We just try and get mid and hit bear.
[27475.24s -> 27477.24s]  Oh, let's go help our home either. I
[27498.18s -> 27500.60s]  I'm actually so sad. I'm playing so bad
[27501.94s -> 27506.26s]  Like I was playing so good at the start and now I'm playing so bad that actually makes me sad
[27507.26s -> 27530.20s]  I was tanking for that guy. All right, let's just leave
[27530.92s -> 27544.59s]  I don't want to I don't want to throw the game for my teammates because like I'm getting like, you know
[27545.91s -> 27549.43s]  I've already died five times like a dipshit
[27549.55s -> 27582.96s]  Oh, where do you go? We should just push bot on a side.
[27584.68s -> 27663.34s]  We don't even need a dragon. Okay, we should just I'm just gonna push bot. Not bad. Not bad at all. I got to give it to I want to give it to night blue, but I got to give it to the slu-lu-lu
[27664.26s -> 27693.57s]  We would play a dead game so good. I got to give it to Lillie. She played so fucking good like actually. I don't even know if she's still in here
[27693.57s -> 27722.43s]  I'm not a script there.
[27722.43s -> 27733.09s]  She thinks I'm a, no, I'm serious.
[27733.09s -> 27739.62s]  She thinks I'm a script there.
[27739.62s -> 27758.72s]  Bro, I'm streaming.
[27758.72s -> 27763.64s]  I did the homie thought I'm a script there.
[27763.64s -> 27765.56s]  You know, I'll take it.
[27765.56s -> 27776.23s]  My ego feels good.
[27776.23s -> 27777.43s]  Honestly, that feels good.
[27777.43s -> 27778.99s]  That feels good.
[27778.99s -> 27785.12s]  Hi, well, thought I was a script there.
[27785.12s -> 27786.68s]  Dude, I'm not gonna lie though.
[27786.68s -> 27790.32s]  Some of those movements were sus as fuck that I was making.
[27790.32s -> 27794.96s]  I was like, I like turned on the fucking mental scripts for that game.
[27794.96s -> 27799.96s]  Some of those movements early were nuts.
[27799.96s -> 27802.92s]  Like, like, just like this tiny little,
[27802.92s -> 27805.36s]  tiny little movements I was doing early game and lame,
[27805.36s -> 27806.80s]  were crazy.
[27806.80s -> 27808.44s]  Like, look at this, watch this.
[27808.44s -> 27809.64s]  Like, this movement right here, right?
[27809.64s -> 27816.89s]  Like, look, look, I dodged that, right?
[27818.01s -> 27826.74s]  Then I walk up, cleanse the thing, kite down.
[27826.74s -> 27832.56s]  Like that, that movement is gross, man, look.
[27832.56s -> 27834.96s]  That was actually some gross ass movement.
[27834.96s -> 27836.24s]  I'm not gonna lie.
[27836.24s -> 27837.08s]  Look at this.
[27838.20s -> 27840.24s]  In the corner, man.
[27840.24s -> 27841.64s]  In the corner.
[27841.64s -> 27843.60s]  Ha ha ha.
[27843.60s -> 27850.20s]  My brain was like, y'know, and drama that, thank you, man.
[27850.20s -> 27851.88s]  Yo, you played really good.
[27851.88s -> 27853.20s]  Now, I felt bad.
[27853.20s -> 27855.88s]  I felt so bad because I was griefing.
[27855.88s -> 27858.72s]  Like, I was like, at the start of the game,
[27858.72s -> 27862.72s]  we were just snowed, like, I literally fucked up like three times.
[27862.72s -> 27864.64s]  During like the really important fights, and I was like,
[27864.64s -> 27870.44s]  oh no.
[27870.44s -> 27872.04s]  Yeah, they're either the bids.
[27872.04s -> 27873.24s]  Can I play Clista?
[27873.24s -> 27878.29s]  I can.
[27878.29s -> 27881.09s]  I'm trying to figure out if I want to play a Clista game,
[27881.09s -> 27889.13s]  or if I want to go my dinner.
[27889.13s -> 27892.09s]  There was one other movement that I thought was kind of nuts.
[27892.09s -> 27894.33s]  I did a really good movement to somewhere.
[27894.33s -> 27898.54s]  I don't remember what it was.
[27898.54s -> 27900.02s]  Here's where I fucked up.
[27900.02s -> 27902.90s]  So right now, I should have just been,
[27902.90s -> 27904.90s]  for some reason, my brain lagged.
[27904.90s -> 27906.74s]  And I should have just been sitting here.
[27907.94s -> 27911.50s]  I should have just cleansed and then started fighting the twitch.
[27911.50s -> 27914.74s]  For some reason, I didn't cleanse, but this wasn't like your fault at all.
[27914.74s -> 27920.14s]  Like, the second the twitch flashed, I should have insta cleanse the ignite, and I should have just been killing him.
[27920.78s -> 27923.42s]  Like, right now, just like autoing, because I can't get away from him, right?
[27923.42s -> 27926.86s]  But it took me an extra second, see how I started fighting him now.
[27929.93s -> 27931.53s]  Like, I barely died.
[27931.69s -> 27932.81s]  I wouldn't have died.
[27933.01s -> 27936.25s]  Had I cleansed, and had I just turned on initially, it was fine.
[27941.96s -> 27946.28s]  And then, like, here I fucked up too, because I went in and I thought we were six.
[27946.28s -> 27956.08s]  Oh, I could have killed that guy.
[27956.08s -> 27958.68s]  I should have gone forward one more.
[27958.68s -> 27960.68s]  Oh, you know what I should have done there.
[27960.68s -> 27963.68s]  I should have gone forward one more auto, killed this guy.
[27963.68s -> 27965.68s]  Lulu would have gotten six off of the kill.
[27965.68s -> 27967.68s]  I would have used my speed to come back out.
[27967.68s -> 27969.68s]  Then she could have altered me.
[27969.68s -> 27972.68s]  We could have killed the, we could have got the twitch
[27972.68s -> 27974.68s]  and then we could have turned on this echo too.
[27974.68s -> 27984.30s]  Oh, this was a really cool TV2.
[27984.30s -> 27987.30s]  I actually thought this TV2 was really sick.
[27987.30s -> 27999.85s]  Look, move is a real one for this man. Listen, you're a real one for this one. You just took the debt to save me.
[27999.85s -> 28023.05s]  respect. You're a real one for that. That was so good. Jesus was fun. Yeah, Jesus. You were the best support I've had today.
[28023.05s -> 28029.75s]  Like, legitimate. You played better than all the other players in the sea, though. I was really good. I was surprised. I was telling my stream I was like, yeah.
[28029.75s -> 28035.15s]  This she's actually like they I said she's here. I don't know you know, but I was like, yeah
[28035.99s -> 28039.45s]  She's playing super good. It's playing way better than all of my fucking demons
[28044.28s -> 28053.84s]  Yo, what time is it six man? Do I want to I want to keep streaming or do I want to go to or do I want to go get food and go to the gym?
[28053.84s -> 28059.10s]  I can't like 24 hour fitness is not actually 24 anymore
[28059.10s -> 28068.04s]  So I have to go soon if I'm gonna go to the gym. But there's only like six
[28079.15s -> 28082.84s]  But I could just end on
[28084.12s -> 28092.49s]  I could just end on the hitting the like 400 LP mark and just chill for now. Right like we have 400 LP
[28092.49s -> 28094.49s]  We'll probably hit GM tomorrow
[28095.69s -> 28098.45s]  So I could just chill for now and then we could just hit GM tomorrow
[28101.05s -> 28107.65s]  That's probably a better idea because then I won't get mad like say say we get like like say we get another game like this
[28107.69s -> 28113.69s]  right like say say we get another game like this where like we're literally winning the game and my
[28113.69s -> 28117.85s]  teams like no let's forfeit like that's gonna make me mad I was mad this is gonna make me mad right
[28117.85s -> 28123.21s]  like I so I'd rather just like get off on a good note like happy note you know like not be tilted
[28129.76s -> 28135.44s]  GM tomorrow yeah hope so I've been I think I can get challenged or back this year but we got to get to GM first
[28135.44s -> 28139.52s]  I'm telling you, this era is so miserable.
[28139.52s -> 28144.64s]  Like, master's here is the worst era I've ever played in
[28144.64s -> 28149.44s]  in my 12 years of playing this game.
[28149.44s -> 28154.44s]  Whatever NA 300 400 LP masters is is literally disgusting.
[28156.76s -> 28159.64s]  These are not real people.
[28159.64s -> 28163.92s]  Like I feel like half of these games we are playing with NPCs
[28163.92s -> 28168.92s]  who quite literally don't even, like, I don't even know what to say
[28168.92s -> 28172.12s]  of their bots, and they can't be real humans.
[28172.12s -> 28175.52s]  They get mad over nothing, they rage quit over nothing.
[28175.52s -> 28179.32s]  They give up at 15 minutes when we're winning the game.
[28179.32s -> 28182.93s]  These cannot be real people.
[28182.93s -> 28187.43s]  So I swear to God, the game has to get better in GM.
[28187.43s -> 28189.13s]  It has to get better.
[28189.13s -> 28192.23s]  There's no world that it gets worse.
[28192.23s -> 28198.47s]  Like I refuse to believe that because this is this is the worst grind I've ever had
[28198.47s -> 28213.00s]  Is it bad to be a pot? Are you saying I'm boughtest? I really can't tell me because I because I I don't like bots
[28213.00s -> 28216.60s]  I said it. I'm saying it. I don't like fucking bots. Well
[28217.40s -> 28221.80s]  Okay, didn't need to add fuck you know what we're just gonna I'm gonna get off. I'm gonna yeah, that's it for me
[28223.08s -> 28228.68s]  I'm gonna get off was I'm tired. I need to go to the gym before I run out of juice make some dinner
[28228.68s -> 28233.64s]  I will be live tomorrow, same time is today. I've been starting my stream at 10 a.m.
[28233.64s -> 28240.08s]  My time. Maybe I'll do it tomorrow at 9 a.m. I don't know. It's 10 or 9.
[28240.08s -> 28245.84s]  Between there, I always start my stream. And so, and that's my time. So it's like 7.
[28245.84s -> 28253.64s]  8.9 PST. You're good at it. Thanks, man. I think I suck. My goal is hopefully I can get
[28253.64s -> 28259.36s]  challenge your back and then I'm not going to play like I just want to my goal is
[28259.36s -> 28265.08s]  challenger so that I can prove to myself it's a really stupid thing but I want to
[28265.08s -> 28269.28s]  prove to myself that I can still do it at 32 because 10 years ago was the first time
[28269.28s -> 28273.04s]  I started streaming this year, right? I've been streaming for 10 years this year and
[28273.04s -> 28277.20s]  so I want to get challenger because when I first started streaming I was in challenger
[28277.20s -> 28283.04s]  and I want to see if like after 10 years I can still do it and then I'm never going to
[28283.04s -> 28286.76s]  care again. This will be the only time I ever give a shit about getting
[28286.76s -> 28290.48s]  challenging. I just want to get it. See if I care and then play for content.
[28290.48s -> 28295.84s]  You know, but yeah, it's just it's just like, well, come to the league of
[28295.84s -> 28302.16s]  driving. See if the old man who has fucking arthritis and fucking
[28302.16s -> 28305.20s]  carpal tunnel and all that shit, you know what I mean? See if I still do it.
[28307.04s -> 28310.08s]  Yo, thank you for the Twitch Prime man. I appreciate it. Thank you so much.
[28310.08s -> 28312.08s]  I appreciate it a lot, dude.
[28312.08s -> 28313.48s]  All right guys, that's going to be it for me.
[28313.48s -> 28315.60s]  If you like this stream, don't forget to follow all my socials
[28315.60s -> 28318.20s]  and TikTok and Facebook and Instagram and all that shit.
[28318.20s -> 28319.92s]  All the clickable garbage is underneath the stream.
[28319.92s -> 28322.44s]  Don't forget to check it out.
[28322.44s -> 28325.40s]  I'll be back tomorrow, same time in the morning.
[28325.40s -> 28327.84s]  Tomorrow's my last day for the weekend, though.
[28327.84s -> 28329.56s]  I'm not going to stream on Saturday.
[28329.56s -> 28332.36s]  I might do some off stream grinding on Saturday.
[28332.36s -> 28334.80s]  I've been taking, I've been like forcing myself to take a day off
[28334.80s -> 28338.88s]  of streaming every week, just so like I can mentally recharge.
[28338.88s -> 28345.68s]  And I think it's actually been really good for my stream because like I've been in a much better mood while streaming and I've been much less tilted and I've been
[28346.80s -> 28353.16s]  Even if I play League off stream or whatever, it's just like it doesn't feel as forced. So I feel like the break nice. So yeah tomorrow
[28353.16s -> 28357.60s]  No stream on Saturday tomorrow for sure and Sunday I might I might do a short stream
[28358.04s -> 28361.14s]  But yeah, I'll see you guys then. Thanks for watching. I appreciate you guys
[28363.72s -> 28370.70s]  And yeah, that's it. I'm gonna make dinner. Oh, we guys have a good night. Hey wherever the fuck you are
[28370.70s -> 28376.14s]  better dudes, hope you guys have a good one. I was fun playing with it in drama. Go
[28376.14s -> 28381.10s]  out on the games. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Peace.
