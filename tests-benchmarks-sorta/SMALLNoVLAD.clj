[190.19s -> 208.00s]  Yeah, that guy has GP bees
[215.50s -> 216.90s]  Jesus
[216.90s -> 320.74s]  Yo, it was a man. What's up dudes? Yeah, I mean we're hoping
[321.18s -> 327.57s]  We'll see man. We'll see
[330.25s -> 390.99s]  Fingers fucking crossed right? Do I ever actually?
[392.15s -> 408.17s]  I'm wondering if I I'm assuming I'm just playing a math
[462.38s -> 463.70s]  Yay
[463.70s -> 484.16s]  Yeah, this is probably just me doing fucking. I'm probably just doing star guardian
[498.34s -> 502.08s]  Welcome to the room for the 27 months man
[503.48s -> 530.98s]  Appreciate it a lot dude. Thank you, and I could probably still go infinite team, but so I'm holding the solution
[531.72s -> 533.72s]  But I haven't seen any severs or anything
[534.78s -> 619.95s]  So it'd be kind of awkward, you know this guy's definitely gonna beat me that guys I
[621.03s -> 625.19s]  See why he hasn't lost that's he has five infinity team already. Jesus Christ. I
[626.31s -> 628.95s]  Was like man, why is that guy so strong and then I like realized
[629.55s -> 780.80s]  So I go to seven next rounds, and then hopefully we can hit
[782.14s -> 806.32s]  Some shit I kind of like this actually because now we can make I
[807.60s -> 809.28s]  can actually make a
[809.28s -> 811.28s]  Guard breaker and I could also make
[811.76s -> 848.94s]  We go like guard breaker and math. I kind of want to just ionic spark, but I don't know if I should I need
[850.32s -> 852.32s]  an echo a
[852.40s -> 854.40s]  Niko or a round
[854.40s -> 857.40s]  I also could use an Ezreal. I need like a quick draw.
[858.40s -> 876.02s]  I should have kept that Lucian from earlier.
[876.02s -> 880.02s]  He's got a level 3 Blitzcrank and he's just so fucking strong it's stupid.
[880.02s -> 950.92s]  This is really interesting.
[950.92s -> 975.23s]  I guess I could go Spellslinger as well.
[975.23s -> 978.23s]  And we can just give the Shiv to TF.
[978.23s -> 1007.98s]  We can just do this for now too.
[1007.98s -> 1037.21s]  I guess I could use...
[1037.21s -> 1042.18s]  I could do Jeweled Gauntlet.
[1042.18s -> 1044.50s]  I don't know.
[1044.50s -> 1048.51s]  Could Jeweled Gauntlet this shit up?
[1048.51s -> 1104.89s]  See how it goes. I need to like throw an item down
[1105.93s -> 1119.86s]  But I feel like morellos is bad. I guess I could just use hat or like I said before jeweled gauntlet could be good
[1119.86s -> 1148.00s]  I don't know. I could just roll on seven to train three-star stuff
[1148.40s -> 1155.78s]  This guy has three Kaisa's though. This guy has one Kaisa
[1156.30s -> 1161.86s]  Kind of hard to three-star Kaisa. I could three-star Nyla
[1162.62s -> 1193.10s]  They're gonna sell eight with fucking 20 gold
[1193.10s -> 1297.79s]  Here he has MF and dude Blitzcrank is insane.
[1297.79s -> 1357.48s]  Dude that gnar just murked me.
[1357.48s -> 1371.58s]  I did not position for the gnar and I got fucked for it.
[1371.58s -> 1399.18s]  This motherfucker.
[1399.18s -> 1404.18s]  Dude I wish I could get some thick frontline leveled up.
[1404.18s -> 1420.06s]  That'd be cool.
[1420.06s -> 1546.33s]  Oh my god another NAR well rip I was gonna go MF and then I like decided to go Niko
[1546.33s -> 1621.17s]  and then I just fucked it all up oh well oh well time is it 10 what's up boys how's
[1621.17s -> 1645.18s]  everybody doing I'll be right back so I'm still waking up with me give me one
[1645.18s -> 1682.68s]  sec sub sky oh okay oh yeah baby I was gonna play on my main at the start but
[1682.68s -> 1686.04s]  dude I don't know if I can sit through fucking eight minute queue times to get
[1686.04s -> 1689.60s]  people raging at each other all day so we'll we'll do some warm-up on this
[1689.60s -> 1713.82s]  account for a bit what I'm Mars is count like D1 well master like my
[1713.82s -> 1719.10s]  counts like 500 this one's I want to say like I don't know the MMR is really
[1719.10s -> 1724.14s]  awkward when you get like low masters right like the MMR super awkward so I
[1724.14s -> 1727.22s]  don't know what the MMR is but I know it's low masters so like sometimes
[1727.22s -> 1732.22s]  there's diamonds sometimes there's like 100 LP players somewhere between there
[1732.22s -> 1746.28s]  dude I I played some games off stream yesterday I got up to like 400 LP then
[1746.28s -> 1758.70s]  then I lost 3 in a row. That shit was painful. I did int one of tenacity's games though,
[1758.70s -> 1774.10s]  so that was fun. That felt bad. Oh yeah, straight up it felt so bad. He was doing so good too.
[1774.10s -> 1780.73s]  I straight up just had a bad game and I felt like shit. Look at this shit. I just dropped
[1780.73s -> 1787.73s]  like 8 deaths. Look at this shit. He was just straight up smurfing on the enemy top
[1787.73s -> 1793.21s]  later and we all the entire team just like decided to collectively run it down
[1793.73s -> 1805.06s]  Like we all just got shit on this was a really weird game because I feel like
[1808.17s -> 1809.57s]  That game was like the first game
[1809.57s -> 1814.45s]  I felt everybody in the game was like actually high GM challenger, but they weren't right at that
[1814.97s -> 1817.33s]  There's a very weird system going on
[1817.85s -> 1838.97s]  Let's do a Cassiopeia game like I'll show you guys what I mean in a second. I'm assuming I should go this right
[1838.97s -> 1856.98s]  this is probably good or this that's probably good too oh well okay so yeah
[1856.98s -> 1862.36s]  look at this stuff like Neon Tonso is like he's been challenger for a long
[1862.36s -> 1868.54s]  time right I don't even know who the fuck this guy was some random Senna
[1868.54s -> 1874.86s]  player who's like not playing Senna now and then this guy was like trying to
[1874.86s -> 1879.22s]  jungle and just like running it down it was I don't even know it was the
[1879.22s -> 1886.86s]  weirdest game that I've played in a while cuz like my ad carry wasn't bad like
[1886.86s -> 1889.98s]  this guy's clearly like on a smurf but I don't know how good he was cuz he wasn't
[1889.98s -> 1897.90s]  bad at the game the enemy ad carry wasn't bad this guy's also on a smurf it was
[1897.90s -> 1902.34s]  the weirdest lobby it was like a bunch of smurf accounts all playing with
[1902.34s -> 1909.01s]  each other but it was like a non-smurf queue this guy was like the
[1909.01s -> 1926.33s]  only non-smurf it was interesting ooh do I take ghost here or do I just I thought
[1926.33s -> 1930.51s]  ghosts could be really OP versus their team with Cassiopeia but maybe I should
[1930.51s -> 1944.30s]  just take I'm gonna try it oh somebody dodged cuz yeah I don't know I never
[1944.30s -> 1949.22s]  know I never know if I should take ghosts ignite whatever because I feel
[1949.22s -> 1952.34s]  like ghosts with Cassios feels like the same thing's AD carry right same
[1952.34s -> 1965.56s]  idea where it feels really OP dude there's so much drama going on in the
[1965.56s -> 1998.34s]  community yet again by the way it's it's insane yeah I don't know man I I just
[1998.34s -> 2010.90s]  I'm I like I like looking at drama cuz like drama is juicy like I like looking
[2010.90s -> 2034.70s]  at drama but it's also like how are people so stupid yeah I'm getting like
[2034.70s -> 2042.82s]  I don't know man my view on all of this shit is like I I guess I'm just not
[2042.82s -> 2048.26s]  hardwired that way I can't mentally wrap my head around being like excited to
[2048.26s -> 2061.55s]  flirt with underage girls or like when I just I never like had the want like it
[2061.55s -> 2067.71s]  happens so much between like league streamers and non like just it's not
[2067.71s -> 2069.59s]  even a league thing it's just that we're in the league community right so
[2069.59s -> 2076.59s]  you see it more dude like well the drama is like a decent size league
[2076.59s -> 2080.11s]  streamer who was like getting bigger or whatever like the ad carry streamer cookie
[2080.11s -> 2092.28s]  roll or whatever he was like somebody made a 90 page 90 pages of Google Doc to
[2092.28s -> 2096.80s]  basically like expose this guy for like talking a bunch like sexually to
[2096.80s -> 2102.28s]  underage girls not paying his fucking like mods who do work for him and like
[2102.28s -> 2119.48s]  other stuff and I'm like dude yeah how man like just be a normal human it's not
[2119.48s -> 2200.77s]  that bad like I take it for me being a normal dude it's not that bad sorry I
[2200.77s -> 2206.31s]  was distracted no uh yeah I don't know man I swear to God people are just
[2206.31s -> 2211.93s]  stupid as fuck people were idiots there's got to be some psychological
[2211.93s -> 2221.26s]  Underline issue with people's brains not working, but it is what it is. Huh? I've had this market account for a while
[2228.77s -> 2237.54s]  Dude, what is that tarik skin? You see this we just tarik skin many fabulous
[2238.62s -> 2240.62s]  Good day
[2240.62s -> 2242.62s]  My man's just straight up fabulous
[2256.38s -> 2258.38s]  People are desperate. I
[2258.38s -> 2263.94s]  I just can't like I don't think like I've been in the situation where I was like a really really big streamer
[2264.34s -> 2269.68s]  Like much bigger than he is and I got like I this is what I'm saying is like I understand
[2271.74s -> 2276.38s]  Like all of the crap that gets thrown at you like people will literally message you for no reason
[2276.78s -> 2281.50s]  Like you do have like fans that have like when I was at my biggest point
[2281.50s -> 2283.50s]  Like you have fans that are younger
[2283.50s -> 2288.74s]  Girls guy it doesn't matter and like you just got a like I just never in my mind
[2288.74s -> 2292.86s]  I guess thought like oh I'm gonna flirt with these people like it made me like I
[2292.86s -> 2297.72s]  don't even I wouldn't even I literally didn't even see them as like sexual in my
[2297.72s -> 2310.00s]  brain like it blows my mind and then the fact that like if you like if you
[2310.00s -> 2314.48s]  look at the Google Doc or whatever the fact that like taco like I keep a
[2314.48s -> 2317.90s]  taco whatever it was literally talking to him telling him he was doing it
[2317.90s -> 2321.90s]  Like what he was doing was wrong. He was like, yeah, I get it, right? Then he did it again
[2322.70s -> 2336.28s]  Dude the set alting the pussy that that
[2337.40s -> 2340.36s]  I'll be on it. That may be one of the funniest lines I've ever heard
[2355.08s -> 2359.04s]  Like dude, I mean, whatever, you know, I'm not here to kink shame whatever gets people off
[2359.04s -> 2362.44s]  You know, maybe maybe maybe that's a fetish. I don't know
[2393.63s -> 2399.68s]  Blah blah blah safe and sounds either way
[2401.10s -> 2403.10s]  Don't worry. We can not talk about the drama real quick
[2403.82s -> 2405.82s]  we could talk about uh
[2406.86s -> 2427.25s]  How old and washed up wings of death is though I'm kidding
[2432.45s -> 2434.89s]  Yo, did you see on a glider note though? Did you see riot?
[2435.93s -> 2442.41s]  There was like a reddit thread or something where riot was saying that they're like gonna try and do something about smurfing in the next few months
[2442.41s -> 2445.79s]  I don't know what that means
[2445.79s -> 2458.33s]  But, can you tell us something involving wings?
[2458.33s -> 2459.33s]  Just between us.
[2459.33s -> 2460.83s]  Yeah, yeah, just between us and all the homies.
[2460.83s -> 2461.83s]  Yeah, yeah, in chat.
[2461.83s -> 2462.83s]  Yeah, yeah.
[2462.83s -> 2463.83s]  Nobody else say anything.
[2463.83s -> 2467.68s]  It's fine.
[2467.68s -> 2479.08s]  Yeah.
[2479.08s -> 2480.08s]  No.
[2480.08s -> 2499.60s]  What's up?
[2499.60s -> 2500.60s]  My chat ain't snitches.
[2500.60s -> 2503.60s]  When I was a teen, I made a montage of him having breakdowns in my games.
[2503.60s -> 2504.60s]  Oh my God.
[2504.60s -> 2505.60s]  That's amazing.
[2505.60s -> 2515.16s]  Oh my God, that's amazing.
[2515.16s -> 2518.68s]  I feel like I need to pay you to see this montage.
[2518.68s -> 2546.49s]  will give you money I need to see this is important to me oh I have dude you
[2546.49s -> 2551.45s]  should see the I have so many rage compilations about me it's crazy so many
[2551.45s -> 2566.83s]  I had a I had a villain arc for sure I feel you just comes with like being a
[2566.83s -> 2577.24s]  League streamer these players are not all mentally healthy let me let me tell
[2577.24s -> 2593.29s]  you take it from me and okay I'd like to think I'm not a villain anymore fuck
[2593.29s -> 2625.62s]  you. I really want this plate. Nice. Dude, Anivia's roaming. Why is there a Wukong just
[2625.62s -> 2644.42s]  sitting top by the way? That's actually hilarious. You know what's interesting? I feel like Tarik
[2644.42s -> 2649.14s]  actually missed that stun. I was kind of side eyeing that, but I feel like he missed
[2649.14s -> 2674.02s]  that stun somehow. I feel like this is the easiest game I've ever played by the
[2674.02s -> 2676.02s]  I'm on full autopilot
[2676.90s -> 2681.96s]  Rain still waking up, and I feel like they're just walking into me on repeat. I'm just killing them all I
[2682.66s -> 2684.66s]  Don't even know what the fuck's going on
[2685.54s -> 2690.78s]  Like they it feels like the enemy team has not like they didn't they didn't like understand we were playing league
[2691.22s -> 2693.70s]  Right like they queued up, and they were like, oh, yeah, this is league
[2694.94s -> 2696.94s]  That's what this feels like
[2697.62s -> 2701.64s]  This is what I imagine if like Mike Tyson went into a preschool, you know what I mean like this is what this feels like
[2701.64s -> 2737.68s]  must say I probably could have killed those guys but I don't want to the
[2737.68s -> 2762.81s]  chill I'm assuming the wukong is gonna come bot soon there is damn it I
[2762.81s -> 2772.57s]  quins late I actually kill bull that was a late quins by me my bed I don't want
[2772.57s -> 2777.97s]  to take the risk of a backup she stuns me they get one shot me I should
[2777.97s -> 2779.97s]  Killed the fucking guy though
[2780.97s -> 2785.25s]  The wukong I just backed up too far, and then I cleansed the stun for no like really late
[2786.25s -> 2797.00s]  Hi, Jera. It was a man. So boys
[2797.66s -> 2802.08s]  Good evening. Good evening. Good morning. I don't know where the fuck you guys live. So good day
[2815.13s -> 2816.97s]  Fuck am I watching?
[2816.97s -> 2827.77s]  Wait that wukong lived
[2832.82s -> 2837.12s]  Whoa, bro. Oh, I'm dead
[2839.20s -> 2841.20s]  Dude that wall was BS
[2841.20s -> 2847.28s]  There was like a little hole and then I flashed late because I was like, oh, I could walk out the hole
[2847.80s -> 2849.80s]  But I couldn't walk out the tiny little hole
[2851.92s -> 2853.92s]  mother fuckers I
[2854.48s -> 2863.59s]  Shouldn't have even been there, but like I'm stupid. I should just push bot. I was like, dude
[2863.59s -> 2866.47s]  That's such a bad fight, but I walked over to it. I was like, I'm really fed
[2867.59s -> 2870.87s]  Honestly, I probably could have killed him if I didn't say if I like flashed the
[2870.87s -> 2881.26s]  stun. Annie stuns the only like most over like I swear if they reduced Annie
[2881.26s -> 2887.30s]  stun by like 0.5 seconds she would never get played like actually the only
[2887.30s -> 2892.70s]  reason to play Annie is her stun is just so OP because it's like a it's like the
[2892.70s -> 2896.18s]  reason they changed Tarak so long ago where like when you have a point click
[2896.18s -> 2915.28s]  CC. It's typically really broken. Okay, I'm just dead. Does Taric not have ult leveled
[2915.28s -> 2946.75s]  up at 6? He didn't level his ulti. Maybe it's, maybe Taric ult sucks. Maybe it's underpowered.
[2946.75s -> 2961.32s]  You know? No, yeah, he must have misclicked. Honestly, I'm just briefing. I'm like applying
[2961.32s -> 2966.32s]  to aggro for like, like I threw my lead because I was like, oh shit, I'm gonna
[2966.32s -> 2969.68s]  walk over and help the homies you never walk over and help the homies when the
[2969.68s -> 2974.28s]  homies are getting shit on because uh if you have like 900 gold or a thousand
[2974.28s -> 2976.76s]  gold lead like it like I did or whatever you don't want to do that's
[2976.76s -> 2994.60s]  because you'll give MF a ton of kills we're in a good spot now though but I
[2994.60s -> 3001.57s]  am still a little wait Tarek oh we have all this old winners this Tarek does
[3001.57s -> 3006.55s]  not know how to play Tarek by the way he's throwing out his stun so
[3006.55s -> 3018.87s]  awkwardly. That's okay though. I mean, I apparently don't know how to play driving, so can't really
[3018.87s -> 3032.73s]  blame the guy. I mean, you guys are doing dragon with no smite. Well, it seems like doing dragon
[3032.73s -> 3053.16s]  with no smite. I mean, we could fight these fights, but it's like painful. We could easily
[3053.16s -> 3060.47s]  fight these fights. I think a lot of it is just like, Tarik isn't confident enough to walk
[3060.47s -> 3064.23s]  up and stun right like that's that's what I'm seeing the issue is he's doing the
[3064.23s -> 3067.31s]  thing where like he's not he doesn't have the confidence to actually walk up
[3067.31s -> 3075.61s]  since he's a melee champ so he's walking up and like taking half his health and
[3075.61s -> 3081.79s]  it's making him nervous it happens a lot with players who aren't very melee
[3081.79s -> 3086.13s]  champ centric because melee supports are actually pretty risky or they're
[3086.13s -> 3100.98s]  pretty scary rather oh he's totally dead I don't know but yeah melee
[3100.98s -> 3106.50s]  supports are scary to play because you have to know when you can get a kill by
[3106.50s -> 3111.58s]  going in because you're gonna take damage right that's just like the nature
[3111.58s -> 3122.19s]  of melee supports nice we're coming back in a bit not bad we threw a little bit
[3122.19s -> 3127.90s]  early but yeah we're starting to get it back we're chillin Tarik's are never
[3127.90s -> 3132.86s]  good I I'm always confused by Tarik because he feels like such a good
[3132.86s -> 3138.66s]  champion like the champion itself feels broken as shit like whatever I whenever I
[3138.66s -> 3146.82s]  see Terek I think to myself like he's either unkillably like super OP or
[3146.82s -> 3153.26s]  they're like 0 and 10 there's no in between right like they either know how
[3153.26s -> 3170.80s]  to play Terek or they know is what it feels like oh you I mean yeah you are
[3170.80s -> 3177.32s]  wrong taric actually requires mechanics that's actually true where's like most
[3177.32s -> 3180.96s]  supports like not always doesn't have mechanics you know and like what's
[3180.96s -> 3184.12s]  crank doesn't have mechanics they just hit their button and if it if it works
[3184.12s -> 3190.16s]  that they they get a kill where's like taric after you stun there is like
[3190.16s -> 3212.58s]  stuff you have to do that does make sense or block do you think oh I'm gonna
[3212.58s -> 3221.83s]  die oh thank god do you think Terak's one of the harder supports I think he's I
[3221.83s -> 3227.69s]  think he's pretty hard but I don't think he's well I mean he's harder than the
[3227.69s -> 3231.11s]  other supports like I think like I don't think there's a single support
[3231.11s -> 3256.60s]  that's hard I know I'm I'm toxic for that but I stand by it whoa I mean I'm
[3256.60s -> 3260.52s]  just gonna die I'm not gonna try and flash I don't think I should have just
[3260.52s -> 3266.72s]  Flashed over, but I kind of got baited by the Terakult. I wanted to see like if I could fight but there's too much to see
[3267.92s -> 3270.04s]  I was like, oh, he's halting me. Let's go. I
[3271.94s -> 3277.96s]  Can tell this is a really low elo game because there's so much random deaths like I'm falling victim to like
[3277.96s -> 3283.02s]  I'm autopiloting and like I'm not thinking and I'm just talking to you guys and I'm just dying for free
[3283.30s -> 3287.16s]  But it's like there's so many people just dying for free. It's hilarious
[3287.66s -> 3290.66s]  Thresh Thresh isn't actually that far. So
[3291.90s -> 3297.74s]  Like a lot of people think like Thresh mechanically is very difficult because he has harder than the other supports
[3297.86s -> 3304.66s]  But he's not actually that hard. He's like once you learn the Thresh combos. He's pretty much a
[3306.02s -> 3313.53s]  Very upfront champion. Yeah, like
[3317.40s -> 3323.14s]  Like Lantern for example is one of the most broken things to ever be put in league and everybody fucks it up
[3323.80s -> 3328.28s]  Like people will will just mess up Lantern because they'll throw it for souls or they'll mess up
[3328.28s -> 3333.34s]  Like you can literally just hold lantern perma and your ad carry can walk up
[3334.70s -> 3339.12s]  Auto the turret and and and you literally like they literally can't play the game after that
[3345.22s -> 3348.58s]  Like the enemy team. I mean because like there's nothing they can do to stop it
[3349.10s -> 3352.48s]  We can totally fight this by the way
[3353.38s -> 3356.98s]  So like I've done that before we're like my thresh where I know I have a good throw
[3356.98s -> 3358.98s]  Hold on. Let me let me win this team fight really quick
[3360.38s -> 3383.80s]  Give me a sec
[3383.80s -> 3387.60s]  Okay, cool. So I had to I had to win that team power quick. Okay, so as I was saying
[3388.20s -> 3390.20s]  there's a lot more to Thresh than
[3391.28s -> 3393.28s]  People think right
[3393.28s -> 3397.22s]  It's essentially people over complicate like what he needs to do
[3397.48s -> 3400.76s]  So it's like Thresh is a very basic tip like when you see Thresh in pro play
[3400.88s -> 3404.64s]  You you don't ever see like what you do, but it's very rare that you see like the sick
[3405.20s -> 3410.38s]  Permal hooking like oh my god, like it's mainly like they pick him for like Lantern
[3410.38s -> 3415.66s]  it's right out like when they when they pick thresh and high elo he's not picked to be the
[3415.66s -> 3421.36s]  god tier like always landing perma cc hooks like flay god like he's picked to like shut
[3421.36s -> 3431.24s]  down engage and remove kill threat to your carries that's all he's picked for that's
[3431.24s -> 3437.63s]  he's literally just an dw bot armor stacking I mean yeah the armor thing on thresh is
[3437.63s -> 3444.05s]  nice but it's I wouldn't say it's like OP on his kit it just makes him like not die
[3444.05s -> 3446.05s]  To 80 carries in two seconds
[3449.86s -> 3453.38s]  What what has happened?
[3453.38s -> 3457.96s]  But I instantly know I'm playing with a good Thresh player when I can walk up to the turret
[3461.68s -> 3463.68s]  When I can walk up to the turret and the threat
[3475.56s -> 3479.08s]  Sorry, I was trying to think and talk at the same time when I can walk up to the turret
[3479.08s -> 3483.04s]  My Thresh player won't walk up and auto the turret with me. That's like the sign of a good Thresh player
[3483.92s -> 3488.48s]  When we don't know where the enemy is and instead of walking up and trying to hit the turret to like help
[3488.48s -> 3493.68s]  kill the turret they'll stand in the back and literally just sit there and wait and hold lantern until
[3497.04s -> 3501.28s]  they just hold their lantern until like you can until you get ganked essentially.
[3504.67s -> 3508.59s]  And that's why I like I said I just personally don't think Thresh is mechanics as hard as people
[3508.59s -> 3513.47s]  think. I do think he's he's very knowledge based like I think Thresh has high knowledge caps
[3514.19s -> 3520.43s]  where like if you're playing I don't know like Lulu your skill is basically like do I W your
[3520.43s -> 3525.75s]  your decision-making Lulu is literally do I W to speed or do I W to CC right like
[3525.75s -> 3529.75s]  that's your that's your decision-making so it's like obviously much higher than
[3529.75s -> 3539.83s]  that but it's you son of a bitch but it's still not like that bad I think Thresh
[3539.83s -> 3545.63s]  just intimidates people because he can do so much and so I think people just
[3545.63s -> 3548.75s]  get intimidated but because they they think it looks overwhelming to learn
[3548.75s -> 3558.18s]  the champ. I feel like that actually intimidates a lot of people in terms of like people not wanting to
[3559.06s -> 3567.54s]  learn new champions and shits. I feel like a lot of it is just um people are nervous about learning
[3567.54s -> 3574.54s]  champions that look overwhelming right. Like Aphelios for example I was talking about this
[3574.54s -> 3580.54s]  yesterday. Aphelios is not a hard mechanical champion like he's difficult in terms of
[3580.54s -> 3582.94s]  of the knowledge required.
[3582.94s -> 3586.30s]  Like he's knowledge gated very hard, right?
[3586.30s -> 3588.82s]  So you have to play him a decent amount
[3588.82s -> 3592.26s]  or like research him to understand what guns do what,
[3592.26s -> 3594.74s]  how to interact with the guns, stuff like that, right?
[3594.74s -> 3597.78s]  But the actual mechanics of using the guns,
[3597.78s -> 3599.26s]  it's actually not hard.
[3600.62s -> 3614.11s]  Guys, what are we doing?
[3614.11s -> 3618.95s]  I guess we're just winning the fight.
[3618.95s -> 3621.75s]  Pike?
[3621.75s -> 3626.60s]  Like I think Pike's harder than Thresh.
[3626.60s -> 3627.60s]  Maybe that's a hot take,
[3627.60s -> 3631.86s]  but I think Pyke is harder than Thresh.
[3631.86s -> 3634.50s]  Because Pyke requires like really specific.
[3637.16s -> 3640.76s]  Pyke is a lot harder to play than he looks
[3641.84s -> 3643.34s]  when you see people play him.
[3644.90s -> 3647.68s]  Because there's like timers of when you can go in
[3647.68s -> 3649.28s]  off of certain things.
[3649.28s -> 3651.24s]  Like hitting his ulti consistently in teamfights
[3651.24s -> 3653.52s]  is a little harder than people think.
[3653.52s -> 3656.52s]  And knowing how to position in the lane,
[3656.52s -> 3659.62s]  like Pyke is capable of a lot more than people think.
[3659.62s -> 3661.82s]  So I think Pikes, I think the reason,
[3661.82s -> 3663.26s]  the main reason I think Pikes a little harder
[3663.26s -> 3669.01s]  is because he's melee.
[3669.01s -> 3671.21s]  Like melee champions are always going to be like
[3671.21s -> 3673.97s]  mechanically more difficult than ranged.
[3673.97s -> 3678.28s]  If the melee champion is like,
[3678.28s -> 3680.68s]  you have to engage to go in and do stuff
[3681.64s -> 3690.08s]  because there's always the counter play factor,
[3690.08s -> 3690.92s]  support role.
[3690.92s -> 3691.76s]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[3691.76s -> 3693.20s]  It's like, I'm not saying overall,
[3693.20s -> 3695.28s]  like overall ranged champions require a lot more
[3695.28s -> 3697.00s]  mechanics than melee.
[3697.00s -> 3699.20s]  Just because you're ranged, you can die in a global
[3699.20s -> 3700.80s]  and you have to space and stuff.
[3700.80s -> 3704.84s]  but I think that in just the support specific,
[3704.84s -> 3706.92s]  I think melee is a lot harder to play.
[3706.92s -> 3709.56s]  That's why you see a lot of support players.
[3710.44s -> 3712.24s]  We give the best support players in the world
[3712.24s -> 3714.76s]  are really good at the engage melee supports,
[3714.76s -> 3715.92s]  not the enchanters.
[3715.92s -> 3718.44s]  And that's why you see why we praise
[3718.44s -> 3721.72s]  the best support players.
[3721.72s -> 3725.66s]  Because when you see somebody go in perfectly on Recon
[3725.66s -> 3728.18s]  or go in, find a way in without getting knocked up
[3728.18s -> 3736.48s]  I'm like, I don't know something like when they find the angle on thrash and shit. It's really nice
[3747.62s -> 3752.04s]  Well, I think rel sucks. I think that champ is so bad
[3753.22s -> 3755.02s]  because she just like
[3755.02s -> 3760.76s]  She doesn't do anything
[3761.36s -> 3765.00s]  Like rel's rel's initial thing was like she was supposed to go in
[3765.88s -> 3770.56s]  Be really tanky and then be like a stun bot for like team fights. She was a team fight monster
[3770.80s -> 3772.80s]  but the problem with rel is like
[3773.76s -> 3776.26s]  She has one chance essentially in lane phase.
[3776.26s -> 3779.96s]  Like if anybody has fingers on their hands and they can move left and right,
[3780.46s -> 3782.86s]  rel's really easy to dodge.
[3782.86s -> 3786.36s]  Like it's actually like it's incredibly easy to beat a rel in lane to not die to her.
[3787.20s -> 3789.36s]  Like you just have to move left and right, right?
[3789.36s -> 3790.86s]  It's very simple.
[3790.86s -> 3797.78s]  So it's like it's much more difficult to dodge like other engaged champs,
[3797.78s -> 3798.38s]  if that makes sense.
[3798.38s -> 3800.18s]  Like not unless you can still move left and right,
[3800.18s -> 3802.18s]  but it's like he can walk at you while it's happening.
[3802.18s -> 3806.74s]  where it's like if Raoul walks at you I'm still like just waiting for the
[3806.74s -> 3812.80s]  animation and then I can simply move to the left because like her animation is
[3812.80s -> 3817.68s]  so slow on using her ability that I can like dash I can flash I can there's so
[3817.68s -> 3821.64s]  much counter play and it's like unless she flashes on you but it's even then
[3821.64s -> 3826.00s]  you can tell she's gonna flash on you so it's like I also feel like mid game
[3826.00s -> 3835.02s]  Rel has this issue where she has her one-trick ulti engage fight in teamfights, but after she does that she does literally nothing
[3836.97s -> 3843.72s]  Right. She's like a one-and-done. That's why like she feels like she doesn't have other expression
[3844.08s -> 3852.76s]  She's countered so hard by the meta to
[3853.68s -> 3855.60s]  Milio counters rel engage
[3856.64s -> 3858.64s]  Thresh counters rel engage
[3859.04s -> 3863.58s]  Right like either either of those champions shits on rel engage and you can't do anything
[3863.58s -> 3879.44s]  like I don't know if you've ever tried to play rel gone in and been like
[3879.44s -> 3888.78s]  threshold but it's the worst feeling it's a bad feeling it's like when people
[3888.78s -> 3893.52s]  play Leona it's the same reason Leona is shit right now like they both have the
[3893.52s -> 3898.32s]  same idea of why they're bad right they like have they're both good at doing
[3898.32s -> 3901.56s]  what they're supposed to do like you know stun and create pressure and
[3901.56s -> 3907.08s]  point click and shit but the problem is it's like you can easily counter pick
[3907.08s -> 3915.09s]  them so incredibly hard that they just become worthless the whole game we've
[3915.09s -> 3919.13s]  gotten sent a secondary mission oh all the time with Senna being like with
[3919.13s -> 3922.53s]  Thresh being meta and Senna being like a champion I'm playing a lot I get that
[3922.53s -> 3929.57s]  all the time you don't even notice it though I'm gonna be real when you kill
[3929.57s -> 3932.09s]  the Thresh or whatever and you get these souls you don't even fucking notice
[3932.09s -> 3940.33s]  it cuz like it's like 40 armor and it's like your level 17 or some shit
[3940.33s -> 3945.23s]  at that point like at the point you're getting it you're such a high level that
[3945.23s -> 3956.50s]  like the 40 random armor like it's nice but I never really notice it trying to
[3956.50s -> 3960.42s]  get your teammates ahead isn't that good you don't have actually been doing as
[3960.42s -> 3967.46s]  support on my main account I've actually been roaming non-stop and it's
[3967.46s -> 3980.17s]  super OP because the key to roaming is all you have to do to roam well is
[3980.17s -> 3985.13s]  is literally be there one or two times in the first five minutes of the game
[3985.13s -> 3990.33s]  to completely fuck over the enemy one time on an engage or something
[3990.33s -> 3998.36s]  and they get so far behind from it that you can literally just walk back bot
[3998.36s -> 4002.12s]  like i do on senna like i'll push bot lane this this is my strategy in senna
[4002.12s -> 4005.96s]  i'm gonna give it to you guys okay so i don't i don't know if this works in
[4005.96s -> 4010.76s]  low elo but in like masters like high masters this works at least
[4010.76s -> 4015.64s]  This is all I do on Senna. Every single player I play against on Senna, every single one except
[4015.64s -> 4020.60s]  for like pike players, even Nautilus Blitz, they all concede lane level one. Every single one of
[4020.60s -> 4026.76s]  them, right? They just let me push level one. And so I'll push the waves in level one and I'll
[4026.76s -> 4032.36s]  either crash wave two or wave three depending on how far they're giving me like push power,
[4032.36s -> 4039.56s]  right? So I will always crash wave two or wave three bot and I will immediately roam mid.
[4040.76s -> 4042.76s]  every time and
[4044.52s -> 4046.52s]  Even if I don't get a kill
[4047.08s -> 4052.00s]  Usually it fucks over the enemy mid laner so badly because on that exact timer
[4052.80s -> 4056.66s]  There's usually a gank happening on men
[4057.08s -> 4067.86s]  So a lot of the time people think that you're roaming to get a kill for the laner. You're not you're roaming to counter
[4067.86s -> 4074.79s]  pressure from the other players in the game. How many times have you guys been
[4074.79s -> 4078.75s]  like oh we can win this 2v2 you see the enemy jungler your jungler comes you're
[4078.75s -> 4081.75s]  like oh we're gonna bait this and then all of a sudden the support shows up and
[4081.75s -> 4085.99s]  you're like god damn it and then you die and you're like what the fuck that
[4085.99s -> 4090.07s]  right there is how easy it is to play support because all you have to do is
[4090.07s -> 4096.51s]  show up once twice and now that entire lane is fucked for the enemy team
[4102.02s -> 4103.58s]  Roaming is so easy
[4103.58s -> 4110.44s]  The only thing what people fuck up roaming really bad when they roam on timers where their adc can't safely farm
[4110.94s -> 4115.26s]  So what ends up happening is on that timer right where like I told you wave 2 3, right?
[4116.00s -> 4122.38s]  What happens is you push that wave in you roam mid. Let's say nothing happens. Okay, I can just walk back bot
[4122.90s -> 4127.74s]  It's you lose nothing and if usually at that point you're not you have like three inner gold
[4127.74s -> 4132.22s]  So there's no point in backing right now. Let's say like I noticed that my jungler is like
[4133.06s -> 4136.02s]  Invading topside. I just walk over to top and help him
[4137.22s -> 4139.22s]  Because you have like three to four
[4139.94s -> 4146.30s]  You have like three to four waves before the enemy bot lane the enemy bot lane has to play it almost perfectly
[4150.38s -> 4153.94s]  To be able to abuse your room on certain timers
[4155.50s -> 4157.86s]  They essentially have to play it perfect to abuse the room
[4158.42s -> 4160.10s]  what I mean by that is like
[4160.10s -> 4167.62s]  The way the best way to abuse support roaming is you either a if you have the ability to dive you can pretty much a
[4169.98s -> 4174.74s]  Immediately dive like push the next wave and then immediately dive if you like have that ability say playing
[4174.74s -> 4175.94s]  We own a draven or something
[4175.94s -> 4181.74s]  But even then it's a little risky because then the ad carry can just walk back and they only lose one wave and you gave
[4181.74s -> 4185.30s]  Up, you know a stack chance. So it's not that bad to
[4185.30s -> 4190.82s]  you can stack the wave. Now stacking the wave is the best way to counter it
[4190.82s -> 4195.14s]  because let's say I'm roaming for an extended period you stack like a three
[4195.14s -> 4198.30s]  wave and then all of a sudden you're crashing it and my and then you want to
[4198.30s -> 4201.14s]  like you're up a level because you've been gaining XP and the AD carry has to
[4201.14s -> 4206.02s]  back off but the way to counter that is you simply just walk back on the
[4206.02s -> 4210.10s]  timer of the stacked wave crashing as an AD carry or as a support. It's so
[4210.10s -> 4217.78s]  incredibly easy to do. It's actually brainlessly easy to do. Like, it's literally, you can roam
[4217.78s -> 4223.54s]  all you want bot lane as long as you are in bot lane for the stacked wave crashes or you are in
[4223.54s -> 4235.11s]  bot lane when your jungler is bot side of the map. It's easy as fuck. But support players
[4235.11s -> 4242.47s]  drool on themselves. So they like to essentially, support players like to like AFK in the lane
[4242.47s -> 4248.51s]  phase they like to literally sit there and just do nothing that's like the
[4248.51s -> 4255.58s]  average support I see is they will stand and do nothing and and I've said this
[4255.58s -> 4258.38s]  before but I'll say it again being a good support is not being a better
[4258.38s -> 4261.90s]  player in the enemy team being a good support is queuing up to play League of
[4261.90s -> 4266.82s]  Legends that's that's all it takes all it takes to be a good support is
[4266.82s -> 4271.42s]  queuing up with the intent to push buttons in the game and not just AFK
[4271.42s -> 4505.70s]  Alright, I'm back. What's up? I don't remember what we were talking about. Oh supports, yeah
[4505.70s -> 4515.25s]  they're all stupid. Don't AFK on support, you'll gain LP. It's actually that easy.
[4515.25s -> 4532.73s]  Honestly, I don't think supports are stupid. I think it's more of a, how do I phrase this?
[4532.73s -> 4546.61s]  In my opinion it's more of like, they don't have to learn. Support players don't have to
[4546.61s -> 4552.05s]  learn uh important things because they can get away with not doing it so they get they develop
[4552.05s -> 4570.46s]  bad habits that's all it is. Do you have a Spotify playlist? Yeah. Best role to climb?
[4571.82s -> 4576.46s]  I think every role is good to climb. As long as you're good. Classic Jarrah. Oh I don't see
[4577.50s -> 4580.54s]  whatever you linked. Like I don't know about links in the chat because I had to turn them off
[4580.54s -> 4592.96s]  a long time ago. So I can't see it. I would say though climbing is just about like whatever
[4592.96s -> 4597.68s]  because every role you can climb on right like every single role so climbing a lot of the time
[4597.68s -> 4609.86s]  is just about what you think is most fun for you and you can get the best that I would say objectively
[4611.06s -> 4617.94s]  the best roles to climb on are jungle and support for just like higher elo well jungle
[4617.94s -> 4623.22s]  and lower elo support and higher elo I wouldn't climb on support in like gold
[4623.22s -> 4627.92s]  Because you're not gonna have a good time trying to like help bad players play the game
[4629.40s -> 4631.40s]  Bad it's mean
[4631.40s -> 4636.06s]  People who don't like you can get it like a gold Ezreal 30 kills by being the better support
[4636.26s -> 4637.94s]  But you won't always win
[4637.94s -> 4644.10s]  Whereas like if you really want to control solo queue and your teammates aren't like good enough to carry at that level
[4644.26s -> 4650.88s]  By themselves right like you get frustrated just pick something that has more agency in the game
[4650.88s -> 4665.56s]  You lost 18 of 24 as jungle. You want to turn any role? I mean you can play it. It's if you think it's any carries
[4666.60s -> 4668.60s]  Interesting, I wouldn't say it's like fun
[4669.88s -> 4671.88s]  But it's not it's not bad
[4678.48s -> 4681.12s]  You're in gold. I mean you could try it
[4681.80s -> 4684.56s]  My view on it is that people were wondering if they want to play a role or not
[4684.96s -> 4688.16s]  My view is just try it see if you like it because if you don't like the role
[4688.16s -> 4691.12s]  You're not gonna be able to put in enough games to get good at the role, right? So like
[4691.12s -> 4697.08s]  Just give it a try see if you enjoy it or not and if like it's not fun then if it's not your playstyle
[4697.08s -> 4700.76s]  It's not fun because 80s of our unique playstyle from all the other roles
[4702.28s -> 4704.28s]  Like there the reason
[4704.68s -> 4712.60s]  People don't like playing 80 carry and like like watching 80 carry streamers and shit is because it any carry is like
[4712.88s -> 4716.90s]  It's boring any carries like
[4718.91s -> 4723.11s]  Zero like like if there was a graph of shit going on when you're playing 80 carry in the game
[4723.11s -> 4727.47s]  It's like this there's like spikes to a hundred and then it's back to like this, right?
[4728.23s -> 4731.72s]  it's like
[4731.72s -> 4735.12s]  Any carry is a lot of every game is different
[4735.96s -> 4738.12s]  right every game when you play 80s different
[4739.80s -> 4741.68s]  Because
[4741.68s -> 4748.50s]  You're always with a different player like a different support unless you do okay, so every AD carry games difference coupled with
[4750.04s -> 4754.04s]  You spend a lot of the game just farming, but you don't get to interact with the enemy a lot
[4754.04s -> 4760.58s]  so you just kind of farm a lot of the game and even then you also like you
[4760.58s -> 4763.34s]  basically are farming for like little dopamine hits of like team fights and
[4763.34s -> 4769.56s]  stuff that you get around the game so that's kind of fun but it's like I said
[4769.56s -> 4773.68s]  it's all you you can climb on any role I think 80 carry requires the most
[4773.68s -> 4778.96s]  mechanical skill to climb because the difference between the climbing is like
[4778.96s -> 4781.56s]  a jungler is about being in the right spot at the right time right like you
[4781.56s -> 4785.24s]  need to path this way get objectives etc climbing is an 80 carry is more
[4785.24s -> 4789.40s]  about like this person fucked up their positioning, I'm gonna kill them.
[4789.40s -> 4812.58s]  Type shit.
[4812.58s -> 4818.72s]  We're gonna start a queue.
[4818.72s -> 4827.04s]  Also I want to say something, if you are playing, make sure, and this is just a really good
[4827.04s -> 4831.84s]  standardized bit of advice, make sure you're always tracking what the enemy cooldowns are,
[4831.84s -> 4837.64s]  what their spells are, stuff like that, okay?
[4837.64s -> 4841.30s]  Cause playing the game is not just about like farming and you know like your team
[4841.30s -> 4842.52s]  goes in and you auto and shits.
[4842.52s -> 4846.28s]  Like right now mid's Mia, right? I can see that Varus is Mia, but it is a Varus
[4846.28s -> 4849.36s]  So like I'm not too worried about being like level 2'd by a Varus
[4850.08s -> 4853.84s]  Not that much right so I can kind of play backward because I know that
[4854.92s -> 4859.10s]  It's a high chance. He's not gonna run bottom level 2 as a Varus. Now if that was like a fizz or some shit
[4859.10s -> 4860.56s]  I immediately back up
[4860.56s -> 4864.56s]  So we noticed that it's pretty obvious Rakan probably got W level 2
[4864.56s -> 4868.64s]  We don't know what it is, but he has Q so he doesn't have shield, which means
[4871.99s -> 4876.13s]  Because he doesn't have shield
[4876.13s -> 4879.53s]  It's hard for the Recon to get back out if he fucks up and engage
[4880.41s -> 4885.69s]  So you need to think about these type of things right now. This is wave 4. I believe and because it's wave 4
[4886.19s -> 4891.33s]  We're gonna get level 3 on wave 4. You always get level 3 on wave 4 if you have full XP
[4891.77s -> 4895.85s]  you get level 2 on wave 2 and
[4896.89s -> 4898.89s]  you get level 3 on wave 4 and
[4899.41s -> 4901.65s]  These timers for when you get
[4902.73s -> 4908.98s]  Certain level ups bottling are very important now. I'm gonna hover over here
[4909.78s -> 4915.22s]  uh you see how fiddle is right here i'm actually gonna just walk in here and see
[4915.22s -> 4921.62s]  if i can like yeah we see him nice see this is exactly what i was talking about
[4921.62s -> 4930.26s]  before do you see what my support is doing i i left the lane guys i walked to
[4930.26s -> 4935.70s]  to like stand next to my jungler after we pushed the wave in my lulu is
[4935.70s -> 4959.51s]  Hanging out by herself bot lane, but she's just chilling you don't want to do that
[4960.43s -> 4965.47s]  You don't ever want to be the guy who's like by yourself bot lane as a support
[4966.71s -> 4967.95s]  because
[4967.95s -> 4971.17s]  You don't know like supports don't need gold right not really and
[4971.87s -> 4973.83s]  You don't need farm. You don't need all that shit
[4973.83s -> 4977.71s]  So if you're adc rooms and unless the wave is fucked and they're just being stupid
[4977.71s -> 4980.71s]  You have to fix the wave or something you don't want to be by yourself in the lane
[4980.71s -> 4988.15s]  It just doesn't do anything how about an auto tower? Oh, uh, I used
[4989.19s -> 4994.71s]  Tilda so there's a way there's actually a setting you can have in the game where when you hit a button
[4995.31s -> 5000.51s]  It makes it so that I can't physically hit anything but a champion. It's target
[5000.59s -> 5005.27s]  It's called target champions only and it's basically like here. I'll do it for you right now watch
[5005.27s -> 5007.95s]  You see how like I can hit the tower. You see how it's the red
[5008.79s -> 5009.91s]  sword
[5009.91s -> 5011.19s]  but
[5011.19s -> 5014.79s]  So when I hit this button, I can no longer hit the tower or the minions
[5015.93s -> 5017.93s]  But I can still hit the champions
[5019.65s -> 5025.49s]  So essentially when you're fighting in a big minion wave or you're fighting under turret, you don't want to miss click
[5026.89s -> 5029.25s]  You just hit target champions only button and
[5030.09s -> 5033.81s]  It makes it a thousand times easier because you can literally only hit the champion
[5034.21s -> 5037.72s]  It's really nice
[5037.72s -> 5051.29s]  And you can make the button anything you want obviously I just I use tilde. It's the default
[5051.29s -> 5061.50s]  I actually want to kill these guys, but I need to wait for the wave to push out just the hair
[5062.60s -> 5066.68s]  The jungler could be bought, but it is a fiddlestick. So it's like I don't really care about a fiddlesticks being bought
[5067.02s -> 5082.97s]  We can straight up just kill them. Okay. Well apparently we can't kill them
[5086.90s -> 5089.94s]  Because apparently my Lulu didn't want to walk up
[5090.90s -> 5099.66s]  That's so frustrating man. I did fuck up my my auto there, but I am a little I am kind of curious what happens
[5099.66s -> 5104.94s]  I'd have to go watch the VOD. I fucked up my kill in the Zaya. I think I walked left instead or down.
[5105.10s -> 5110.88s]  My movement was bad. Like essentially when they fought, right? I walked like this. I should have walked like this
[5111.78s -> 5117.86s]  Because you want to cut off the Zaya from the gank. Now, I do think when Lulu just blindly ran away
[5117.86s -> 5123.06s]  I think she kind of grieved. You don't need to insta run from ganks, especially when like you could see what I have, right?
[5123.06s -> 5125.06s]  I have Dirk and Sheen.
[5125.06s -> 5131.18s]  Something that a lot of people do as well is they will see that like the numbers are uneven and they'll instantly run away
[5131.18s -> 5135.02s]  They don't think about like how to win the fight or like what the the win con is of the fight
[5135.30s -> 5141.02s]  Because that's what I was saying before we got ganked right I was like fiddle can't gank us and he can't pre-6 fiddle does nothing in the gank
[5141.02s -> 5143.02s]  I had cleanse
[5143.02s -> 5145.02s]  They don't actually beat us in 3v2
[5145.46s -> 5151.18s]  So the problem was is we weren't focusing the same target. I went for the Zyra and she backed really far up
[5151.18s -> 5156.16s]  Now if we had played forward a bit like say she played a little more forward with
[5156.16s -> 5158.80s]  me that would have gone a lot better or if I had played a little more back with
[5158.80s -> 5165.42s]  her it was basically like we don't have comms so the you know it got rough now
[5165.42s -> 5171.18s]  fiddle is six now so it's a little scary I don't like playing versus fiddle sticks
[5171.18s -> 5176.10s]  for like the reason of like 90% of the time players don't know how to ward
[5176.10s -> 5181.41s]  around fiddle people put wards in weird spots we should have won that
[5181.41s -> 5194.64s]  fight though. I'm a little salty. Mainly myself. So this too, Lulu keeps speeding me up.
[5197.60s -> 5204.69s]  I want to be honest with you, I don't like when Lulu's do that. It's like a pet peeve thing
[5204.69s -> 5209.97s]  of mine when Lulu's use their speed. I'm okay with it if I need to dodge something or I need to
[5209.97s -> 5214.53s]  chase somebody, but I think it's just so much less value than using it to CC early game.
[5214.53s -> 5220.83s]  early game the CC of Lulu like using W is so broken to me because they just
[5220.83s -> 5225.63s]  physically can't move their character for like 1.5 seconds which is crazy I
[5225.63s -> 5239.98s]  think fiddles bot you can kind of tell you see how they're playing really
[5239.98s -> 5245.46s]  aggressive they don't beat us 2v2 so I'm thinking and they just cleared this
[5245.46s -> 5250.70s]  ward out I'm thinking fiddles is either on dragon or he's bush ganking bot
[5250.70s -> 5259.30s]  somewhere so I don't really want to walk up you see how this guy is confidently
[5259.30s -> 5265.72s]  hitting the turret this is making me think fiddles trying to lane gank because
[5265.72s -> 5274.22s]  they cannot beat us 2v2 like I think fiddles in here so I'm actually just
[5274.22s -> 5280.30s]  gonna play safe until we see him on the map I don't know I'm not gonna take
[5280.30s -> 5294.03s]  the chance because you got to think about like what you see and what you
[5294.03s -> 5297.55s]  don't see on the map like we can't physically see fiddle right but think
[5297.55s -> 5301.23s]  about this we don't see him top that's something you have to think about we we
[5301.23s -> 5308.15s]  had a ward on rift just now for 15 15 seconds right we didn't see him top so
[5308.15s -> 5316.20s]  like if he's not top where is he now I think he finally left this looks like he
[5316.20s -> 5333.62s]  went to dragon yeah what are we doing by the way I mean I guess I'm just gonna
[5333.62s -> 5340.32s]  die now would be the time to speed me I mean I don't even know what to say
[5340.32s -> 5352.20s]  about that. Malzahar just didn't walk. Gragas didn't flash his E. Malzahar didn't walk.
[5352.20s -> 5356.74s]  You always walk there by the way. I want to make this clear. If you're a mid laner and
[5356.74s -> 5362.10s]  you're playing a late game scaling mid, you always walk to the fight no matter what though.
[5362.10s -> 5370.40s]  If it's at, if it's going, if it's doing that. Okay guys, we need to walk to fights
[5370.40s -> 5375.24s]  Lulu you need to follow up when I go in don't run
[5375.68s -> 5380.16s]  I'm just gonna type it because I'm actually fucking annoyed
[5382.11s -> 5386.91s]  My little frustrated. I still think the game is 100% winnable, but I'm playing Draven
[5386.91s -> 5389.77s]  We're playing like I'm playing fucking Ezreal or some shit
[5390.51s -> 5395.47s]  And I can't walk up because essentially it we know fiddle was bought for the last two three minutes, right?
[5395.47s -> 5407.45s]  He just sat down there. What is my Lulu doing bro? What are you doing?
[5410.64s -> 5412.64s]  No, we fight this go
[5413.30s -> 5422.15s]  Yeah, this guy doesn't get to do this for free now. They have a gale force, so I need to be a little care
[5423.15s -> 5425.15s]  This guy has no ulti though
[5427.74s -> 5430.98s]  Like this is what I'm losing my mind man. I
[5431.82s -> 5433.58s]  dude just
[5433.58s -> 5438.60s]  follow
[5438.60s -> 5442.28s]  No, what she was doing what she was trying to protect her ward
[5444.00s -> 5448.64s]  She saw the recon hitting the ward but the Ziya walked up to get a freed to just die
[5448.64s -> 5458.70s]  The problem is my Lulu was like, oh, I don't want to give up my ward and she wasn't thinking please
[5459.86s -> 5461.86s]  Just sit with me. Okay
[5462.94s -> 5464.94s]  Yep, sorry. I
[5465.10s -> 5467.10s]  Need you to follow me
[5467.54s -> 5469.54s]  always
[5469.66s -> 5471.66s]  Even if it looks scary
[5472.26s -> 5484.37s]  You gotta follow. Okay. Also, uh
[5484.95s -> 5489.13s]  One thing is there's actually not a lot of fighting that happens in lower elo
[5489.13s -> 5505.13s]  So, a lot of these players don't know how to fight early because one thing that I think has gotten really bad about League lately, just in the past few years, is people don't ever, limit test and League ever anymore, they always just play like pussies.
[5505.13s -> 5518.76s]  Every single player in League plays like a fucking pussy nowadays, and it's literally just like, sad to see.
[5518.76s -> 5521.76s]  Like, right there. Why aren't we W-ing?
[5521.76s -> 5523.76s]  Use W.
[5523.76s -> 5525.76s]  On the Ziya.
[5525.76s -> 5527.76s]  Not too speed.
[5527.76s -> 5532.03s]  Like...
[5532.03s -> 5533.03s]  I'm losing my mind.
[5533.03s -> 5535.03s]  Because all you have to do there is W the Ziya.
[5535.03s -> 5538.03s]  She gets CC'd, we kill her in the W.
[5538.03s -> 5541.03s]  I'm telling you, Lulu players are like hardwired
[5541.03s -> 5544.03s]  for some reason
[5544.03s -> 5562.12s]  to not play correctly.
[5562.12s -> 5563.12s]  I'm never gonna catch this guy.
[5563.12s -> 5565.12s]  He's got Galeforce and Tier 2 boots.
[5565.12s -> 5574.27s]  Yeah, I mean I I have to go for it though because if I don't go for kills now the game's over
[5574.55s -> 5578.63s]  So it's either we go for it or we lose so I'm willing to like look stupid
[5581.94s -> 5585.82s]  Honestly, this game was my fault for the one 2v3 that happened early
[5585.82s -> 5589.28s]  I misplayed it and if I didn't misplay that we would have won the game off it
[5590.18s -> 5592.18s]  Now the game's pretty much over
[5592.94s -> 5600.08s]  Like it's all acute so we can always come back, but the problem is I don't think we have good enough players to come back
[5600.22s -> 5602.22s]  Like look at what Lulu's doing Lulu
[5603.06s -> 5609.61s]  Why are you bought solo at the moment? Think like what?
[5612.09s -> 5614.09s]  What are we doing?
[5614.37s -> 5624.76s]  This is exactly what I was telling you guys. It doesn't make sense
[5625.32s -> 5632.64s]  Remember when I told you supports easy all you have to do is be a human remember when I said that 40 sec or four minutes ago
[5632.64s -> 5633.92s]  Before the game started
[5633.92s -> 5639.94s]  All you have to do to play support is think push buttons and be active in the game
[5639.94s -> 5642.66s]  And if you can do those things you'll get challenger on support
[5642.66s -> 5671.67s]  like it blows my mind like what look what you did what are you doing this is
[5671.67s -> 5691.64s]  a forfeit though I'm gonna lose my minds auto-filled AD I'm gonna lose it my
[5691.64s -> 5704.94s]  bad guess I'm an auto-filled AD I'm just bad it's on me I apologize oh man
[5704.94s -> 5711.53s]  these players are crazy I'm actually really surprised we're just not
[5711.53s -> 5718.30s]  forfeiting now the best way to play the game is something that like I fall
[5718.30s -> 5722.02s]  victim tutu where I fuck this up sometimes right but the best way to play the game a
[5722.02s -> 5729.42s]  lot of the time is you essentially don't play to take risks I know it sounds silly
[5729.42s -> 5738.80s]  because you got to find essentially you have to find the my mouths are hard just
[5738.80s -> 5745.84s]  let um let this guy this 1000 gold walk away hey mouse if you moved by the way
[5745.84s -> 5765.68s]  you get 1k gold. Mid isn't hard roll. I can mid in my sleep. It's not.
[5765.68s -> 5789.54s]  AD is easiest roll. I'm AD carry streamer. I play AD, but Lulu is small brain. That
[5789.54s -> 5793.58s]  was mean. Lulu took some some crossfire there that she didn't need to take. That
[5793.58s -> 5817.88s]  was my bad. That was toxic. I'll be real. I think today is gonna be a mute
[5817.88s -> 5823.88s]  all kind of day listening to low elo players talk about the game and then they think that they're right
[5823.88s -> 5828.76s]  about the game and like how it works and all this shits it actually like hurts me like it shouldn't
[5828.76s -> 5833.08s]  I should just laugh it off but sometimes when I see a low elo player talk about how they think
[5833.08s -> 5837.88s]  the game should be played and I just know that they're wrong it actually like physically hurts
[5837.88s -> 5857.00s]  me it does it physically hurts but I should follow my own rule where if you're playing
[5857.00s -> 5862.20s]  with people that aren't as good like they don't see what you see right there's like something where
[5862.84s -> 5868.20s]  it's better to play safe and scale even on draven it's better to play safe and scale than to go
[5868.20s -> 5880.20s]  for plays in lane uh mainly because if you go for plays in lane and let's say your support is not
[5880.20s -> 5885.16s]  as good as you or your support's not confident in their ability to 2v2 right then you're just
[5885.16s -> 5891.48s]  gonna lose so you're like forcing that person to be in an uncomfortable situation so like it's
[5891.48s -> 5897.08s]  hard for me as a player to just play safe when I see the enemy making mistake after mistake
[5897.08s -> 5901.88s]  it's like something that I have trouble like personally working on right just like a personal
[5901.88s -> 5906.84s]  issue where like I'll see an enemy make a mistake positional wise so I'm like oh shit let's abuse
[5906.84s -> 5912.04s]  this but a lot of the time the problem that happens is you have somebody who doesn't know
[5912.04s -> 5915.80s]  that that person made a mistake or doesn't see the same mistake as me and because there's no
[5915.80s -> 5920.28s]  comms I can't relate to them that we should fight right so if I go in and they don't know that we
[5920.28s -> 5928.36s]  should be fighting there I end up dying and it looks it feels really bad which is I mean
[5929.72s -> 5933.96s]  my fault it's like a personal thing because you can't control your supports you can only control
[5933.96s -> 5942.93s]  yourself it's just something that like I suck at doing sometimes right so that's just on man
[5942.93s -> 5968.20s]  We could actually kill the Zyra now by the way. She's like 60% HP
[5968.96s -> 5995.79s]  Like we could kill her. What is my Gragas doing?
[5997.43s -> 6006.82s]  Oh, he got her though. Nice. Bro use W
[6008.38s -> 6010.38s]  2CC people
[6011.06s -> 6029.28s]  Not to speed people. That was a good example too. Oh well. I just got to get better at doing that where I play safe though
[6029.28s -> 6032.40s]  That's on me. That's just a personal thing. I got to get better at. Oh
[6032.40s -> 6063.40s]  Oh, man, I think we're warmed up though. What ad carry do you guys want to see next game?
[6064.60s -> 6066.60s]  That was that was a brutal ass game
[6067.44s -> 6069.68s]  I'm gonna be real. That was a brutal ass game
[6071.08s -> 6074.44s]  What ad carry streamer do you guys want to see or ad carry stream what ad carry?
[6076.60s -> 6078.32s]  Champion do you guys want to see this game?
[6078.32s -> 6087.14s]  I just goofed up and tried to play too aggressive with a player that wasn't willing to play aggressive. That was on me
[6087.14s -> 6120.62s]  That's my bad. I'll play better. This guy, this guy goes Psyon. Oh, never change. Twitch
[6120.62s -> 6143.89s]  chat never change. Well, the thing is, is you have to change my mindset. So like the
[6143.89s -> 6148.09s]  thing, okay, let me explain something just like a personal thing with me. I'm very,
[6148.09s -> 6151.45s]  very, very good mechanically at this game, right? Like it's my best trade is like
[6151.45s -> 6153.13s]  I have very good mechanics
[6153.13s -> 6155.93s]  So and I also have like an autistic weird brain
[6156.77s -> 6161.71s]  Where I can see I have really good pattern recognition
[6161.93s -> 6168.53s]  So when I see that the enemy is fucking up, I know that I'm pretty much always gonna be better at the 2v2
[6169.33s -> 6171.33s]  okay, so
[6172.21s -> 6175.31s]  Because I know that I'm always gonna be better at the 2v2 I
[6176.97s -> 6178.97s]  Always want to take the fight
[6179.57s -> 6184.37s]  When I see that they make a mistake like they miss a skill shot or they walk up too far
[6184.61s -> 6185.87s]  Stuff like that, right?
[6185.87s -> 6189.61s]  but the problem is when you're ball in you have to work with a teammate and
[6190.17s -> 6195.73s]  That's part of just playing ad carry right and if you're in solo queue. You can't always do it. So you have to I
[6196.29s -> 6198.29s]  Have to like train myself
[6198.89s -> 6203.97s]  To just be okay with them making mistakes and us not abusing those mistakes
[6203.97s -> 6208.65s]  it's very frustrating for me personally because I'm a perfectionist so it's
[6208.65s -> 6211.17s]  very frustrating for me to like see this happening and I'm like oh I want to
[6211.17s -> 6215.53s]  abuse this because I know we can but we have to like I have to like tell myself
[6215.53s -> 6219.29s]  not to and just like not fuck up the wave state not take bad trades and shit
[6219.29s -> 6223.21s]  because every time there's there's more to it too so if like I walk up and I
[6223.21s -> 6226.25s]  take a fight right let's say like when Rakan w'd in when the fiddle ganked
[6226.25s -> 6232.17s]  for example right if I take that fight I'm now banking that fight on
[6232.17s -> 6237.61s]  Lulu also playing correctly right like they they missed all their abilities and they fucked up but
[6238.25s -> 6240.25s]  I also messed like
[6241.69s -> 6246.97s]  You nobody can play perfectly every game like I can't teammates can't nobody can it's league and we're all humans right
[6247.21s -> 6252.81s]  So you have to bank when you're doing that on like your teammate being able to know what you want to accomplish in that moment
[6253.45s -> 6258.97s]  In solo queue with no comms and it's really hard like it's it's a really bad mindset that I have sometimes
[6258.97s -> 6265.83s]  but it's hard to get over because like I like the landing phase for me is the
[6265.83s -> 6271.85s]  most fun part of the game. I love landing phase because in my opinion landing
[6271.85s -> 6276.01s]  phase is like a little mini chess game between the enemy ball and right it's
[6276.01s -> 6280.89s]  like a it's like a chess game with like mechanics where it's like how how well
[6280.89s -> 6285.53s]  can like I auto space them right can I can I space them well can I space them
[6285.53s -> 6289.37s]  like can I by spacing I mean can I walk into them trade and not take
[6289.37s -> 6293.17s]  damage back right and I'm always thinking to myself like okay can I do that I can
[6293.17s -> 6296.61s]  and then I'm like I want to do this right and then I'll like get somebody to half
[6296.61s -> 6300.85s]  and then they'll panic and they'll engage on me and the problem is though is
[6300.85s -> 6305.49s]  like I said without comms or without like people who are recognizing what
[6305.49s -> 6310.65s]  you're trying to accomplish sometimes supports and junglers people get
[6310.65s -> 6314.73s]  flustered and it will go badly and it's my fault at the end of the day
[6314.73s -> 6319.13s]  because I'm choosing to that play style of relying on my teammates instead
[6319.13s -> 6323.17s]  of like knowing that I can probably outscale and play better late game and just like keep
[6323.17s -> 6328.17s]  good CS and not die and shit, which is what you guys should all do.
[6328.17s -> 6330.97s]  And that's what I tell people to do when they ask me how to play AD.
[6330.97s -> 6334.57s]  I tell you like, don't die, scale up, get items.
[6334.57s -> 6338.01s]  But like, because I've played the game for so long and my favorite part of the game
[6338.01s -> 6344.09s]  is lane phase and like winning lane and playing that little chess game, I fuck myself
[6344.09s -> 6349.29s]  over in a lot of games because I'll like you know force fights that like my
[6349.29s -> 6353.73s]  teammate would have to play well in as well to win and I'll make a mistake or
[6353.73s -> 6356.93s]  they'll make a mistake and we'll just lose the game off it and it's not a good
[6356.93s -> 6363.21s]  playstyle right it's not a good playstyle that's just like something
[6363.21s -> 6368.13s]  that like I know other people probably also have and I'm telling you that like
[6368.13s -> 6370.97s]  if you want to climb you got to get out of that mindset and get into the
[6370.97s -> 6379.39s]  mindset of like consistency because you can see last game for example I just
[6379.39s -> 6385.83s]  straight up like lost the game off of me trying to fight when my support didn't
[6385.83s -> 6392.45s]  know how to fight or want to fight and we lost the game off it like I was too
[6392.45s -> 6396.97s]  aggro and even though if they did play correctly we win they didn't so we lost
[6396.97s -> 6403.37s]  so it's basically like it's just not like a good it's not a good what's
[6403.37s -> 6416.62s]  That's the word I'm looking for strategy because last game was my fault because I'm good enough
[6416.62s -> 6420.98s]  at the game that I know that I can't play like that if I want to be consistent and I
[6420.98s -> 6421.98s]  still point like it.
[6421.98s -> 6427.42s]  So it's my bad.
[6427.42s -> 6428.42s]  All right.
[6428.42s -> 6429.42s]  What are we playing this game boys?
[6429.42s -> 6432.38s]  We got Rengar Karma Jin.
[6432.38s -> 6433.38s]  What do people want to see?
[6433.38s -> 6437.38s]  Let me see if any of the 80 carries people want to see if I could play these.
[6437.38s -> 6439.26s]  I can't play Vayne into this.
[6439.26s -> 6440.78s]  Vayne would be way too hard in the Karma Jin.
[6440.78s -> 6451.08s]  I would just get zoned off the wave.
[6451.08s -> 6453.56s]  I could play Aphelios.
[6453.56s -> 6459.72s]  This is actually a good Aphelios game.
[6459.72s -> 6461.16s]  You know what kind of sucks?
[6461.16s -> 6466.52s]  I feel kind of bad playing Aphelios when I'm on my teaching accounts.
[6466.52s -> 6468.44s]  Like this account I teach you guys.
[6468.44s -> 6474.88s]  I feel bad playing Aphelios sometimes because I know a lot of people don't want to learn
[6474.88s -> 6480.84s]  Aphelios or play Aphelios because he is like really...
[6480.84s -> 6483.00s]  He's very unique.
[6483.00s -> 6488.20s]  Like he's he's hard to learn for a lot of people so I feel I always feel kind of bad doing it
[6489.36s -> 6491.04s]  Right
[6491.04s -> 6495.84s]  But I'll be real. I don't know in this specific situation outside of like Jinx. I
[6497.16s -> 6499.16s]  Didn't really know what else to pick
[6499.96s -> 6504.44s]  Like Jinx is good Kaisa's probably okay, but you still get zoned off the wave on Kaisa
[6504.88s -> 6513.82s]  Cuz like if we if we look at this right
[6513.82s -> 6522.97s]  I still would have been I guess okay, but when you're picking a champion for bot lane right
[6523.97s -> 6525.97s]  When you're picking a champion for bot lane
[6526.07s -> 6530.89s]  One thing that you guys should think about when picking like what you you know what champion you want to play unless you're a one-trick
[6530.89s -> 6536.71s]  And then play whatever you want, but if you're like somebody who wants to actually like play the meta and learn why champions are meta
[6536.71s -> 6542.74s]  And when to pick what they picked gin karma now
[6542.74s -> 6545.30s]  Now, we have a Lulu.
[6545.30s -> 6550.78s]  If we had something with a hook, like a Nautilus, a Blitz, a Thresh, a Pike, like if we had
[6550.78s -> 6553.98s]  something like that, I could pick a low-range fighter, right?
[6553.98s -> 6558.34s]  Like, I could pick a low-range fighter if we had a hook champ.
[6558.34s -> 6562.62s]  But because we don't have a hook champ and we have an enchanter, I have to pick something
[6562.62s -> 6567.90s]  that can safely, consistently farm and not get zoned off by their bot lane.
[6567.90s -> 6570.78s]  So there's not a lot of options that can do that.
[6570.78s -> 6574.70s]  like I didn't want to pick you could pick Ezreal here it's not the worst but we
[6574.70s -> 6578.22s]  had a Lulu so I didn't want to pick Ezreal because Lulu goes to waste so
[6578.22s -> 6580.62s]  it's like you could pick Jinx but I kind of didn't want to pick Jinx this
[6580.62s -> 6585.62s]  game because Jinx bores the shit out of me right now so this would be a good
[6585.62s -> 6588.14s]  Jinx game though if you guys are curious like this would be a completely
[6588.14s -> 6594.94s]  fine Jinx game your E stops Rengar jump you can follow up really easily
[6594.94s -> 6601.26s]  with Lulu like this would be a good Jinx game but a Felios it's a good
[6601.26s -> 6602.26s]  It's both.
[6602.26s -> 6605.34s]  It's got a Felios game, good Jynx game.
[6605.34s -> 6607.54s]  It could be a good Xerri game.
[6607.54s -> 6611.50s]  Xerri wouldn't be that bad here with Lulu and against their comp.
[6611.50s -> 6613.02s]  They're already squishy.
[6613.02s -> 6616.78s]  She's really mobile, can get away from Rengar ganks pretty easily.
[6616.78s -> 6623.62s]  Tristana, okay so Trist is unique because you only pick Tristana if you plan on winning
[6623.62s -> 6624.62s]  lane.
[6624.62s -> 6625.62s]  Okay.
[6625.62s -> 6632.58s]  Tristana doesn't actually scale better than Jinx in any way, like she does not
[6632.58s -> 6637.66s]  have a better scaling than Jinx. Trist, Trist versus Jinx three items, Jinx wins
[6637.66s -> 6642.62s]  every time in teamfights no matter what. Like you, she just does what Trist does
[6642.62s -> 6647.78s]  better. Now the reason you pick Trist is because you do want to win lane, you
[6647.78s -> 6650.46s]  want to like jump in, you want to kill them, you want to be aggressive, right?
[6650.46s -> 6654.26s]  So that's what you're picking Trist for is to get kills in lane. The
[6654.26s -> 6658.24s]  The problem is, again, what we were just talking about, let's say I picked Trist to get kills
[6658.24s -> 6659.24s]  in lane.
[6659.24s -> 6664.60s]  Now, let's say my support doesn't want to be aggressive, and let's say the Jhin and the
[6664.60s -> 6667.88s]  Karma have a really good push.
[6667.88s -> 6671.64s]  Something that Trist is really weak at is being pushed in.
[6671.64s -> 6675.32s]  That's one of her weakest things, because she struggles, especially early game.
[6675.32s -> 6678.32s]  She struggles quite a bit on farming under turret.
[6678.32s -> 6682.80s]  So let's say it's just like a coin-flippy pick.
[6682.80s -> 6688.48s]  You could pick Trist if you had like a support duo, for sure, into Gen.
[6688.48s -> 6689.92s]  Trist is amazing into Gen.
[6689.92s -> 6692.24s]  It's one of Gen's hardest actual counters.
[6692.24s -> 6695.64s]  But again, it's not about countering the champion, it's about countering the lane,
[6695.64s -> 6699.84s]  and what the lane is going to do to you, and being able to play around that.
[6699.84s -> 6701.80s]  And this lane is a shove lane.
[6701.80s -> 6703.16s]  Gen Karma doesn't fight you.
[6703.16s -> 6705.12s]  They poke you and shove waves in.
[6705.12s -> 6706.12s]  That's what they do.
[6706.12s -> 6707.12s]  They're a prior win.
[6707.12s -> 6709.28s]  So they're just going to shove and shove and shove, right?
[6709.28s -> 6711.84s]  So because they're just going to shove and shove and shove, I need to play
[6711.84s -> 6714.88s]  something that isn't gonna have issues playing under turret or something that
[6714.88s -> 6719.68s]  could shove back if I need to, right, which is why Jinx and Phallios are both
[6719.68s -> 6727.06s]  good. Ezreal again would just get shoved in, stuff like that, right. These are
[6727.06s -> 6729.78s]  things you actually have to think about when you're playing the game for
[6729.78s -> 6736.06s]  certain champions and certain matchups because a lot of the time people will
[6736.06s -> 6739.34s]  pick a champion that's meta and they won't understand why they're still
[6739.34s -> 6742.58s]  losing the matchup even though they're good at that champion and it's
[6742.58s -> 6746.44s]  It's just that you're not bad at the champ, the matchup is just unplayable.
[6746.44s -> 6752.06s]  You could put Faker, Doublelift, fucking Gumiase in certain matchups and they will just
[6752.06s -> 6753.06s]  lose.
[6753.06s -> 6754.06s]  They will lose the matchups.
[6754.06s -> 6758.18s]  And it's because, no matter how good your mechanics are, if the matchup is played correctly,
[6758.18s -> 6761.48s]  it doesn't- it's not winnable.
[6761.48s -> 6763.84s]  And that's why you see in pro play, drafting is so important.
[6763.84s -> 6767.04s]  It's a perfect example of why in pro play, drafting is 10 times more important than
[6767.04s -> 6768.04s]  solo queue.
[6768.04s -> 6773.17s]  And it's because when everybody plays the matchups correctly and shit, right?
[6773.17s -> 6778.57s]  When everybody's playing the matchups correctly in shits, the matchup skill becomes a thousand
[6778.57s -> 6780.89s]  times more important.
[6780.89s -> 6785.57s]  Or how the matchup's being played, like the champions become way more important.
[6785.57s -> 6788.37s]  Whoa, what the fuck?
[6788.37s -> 6795.09s]  I'm on it there, just fuck that, what the hell is going on?
[6795.09s -> 6798.61s]  Another little tip for you guys, ooh I fucked that, but another little tip for you guys
[6798.61s -> 6814.95s]  is melee champions, or melee minions take one turret shot, two autos, or sorry two
[6814.95s -> 6819.87s]  Two turretshots, one auto, and casters take one auto, one turret shot.
[6819.87s -> 6820.87s]  When you're under turrets.
[6820.87s -> 6821.87s]  Like luck.
[6821.87s -> 6826.07s]  Okay, so learning, this will be a pretty good game to explain to you how to farm under
[6826.07s -> 6827.75s]  the turret actually.
[6827.75s -> 6830.19s]  I was thinking about what I could teach you guys because we're just getting shoved in
[6830.19s -> 6831.19s]  a lot this game.
[6831.19s -> 6843.42s]  It's actually not that bad though, so right now we could actually space forward here.
[6843.42s -> 6856.43s]  Okay, that did not hit me, that was BS, but sure.
[6856.43s -> 6857.99s]  I did the same thing.
[6857.99s -> 6866.71s]  did last game man. I did the same thing. You see I walked up it wasn't it was a good fight but again
[6867.67s -> 6871.91s]  I keep doing that where like I see the fight and I'll take the fight because I know it's a good
[6871.91s -> 6882.17s]  fight but Lulu was too far back so I ended up just inting. It's really stupid. Like it was such
[6882.17s -> 6902.22s]  a dumb play by me because I had to blow both my sums right there because uh the Jin or I mean
[6902.22s -> 6905.82s]  the gin was in a really bad spot and the karma was in a really bad spot because I was level 3 and
[6905.82s -> 6912.06s]  they were level 2 and they were walking up to contest waves but my Lulu was behind me and when
[6912.06s -> 6918.22s]  you're playing you know solo queue you have to play as a team with your teammate okay so this
[6918.22s -> 6934.82s]  gin is kind of griefing right now he's griefing by like walking up when i'm blue gunning him i
[6934.82s -> 6938.26s]  don't know what Lulu's doing oh she's killing that guy nice yeah they're they're griefing
[6938.26s -> 6942.38s]  really hard so the blue guns OP for what you just saw all you have to do with the
[6942.38s -> 6947.50s]  blue gun if you really want to just like have a funny ass overpowered fucking when
[6947.50s -> 6958.43s]  they're farming under the turret like that just hit the minions okay we're
[6958.43s -> 6969.62s]  getting ganked back up so I kind of did a cardinal sin there I would say like a
[6969.62s -> 6979.22s]  sin of like I overstayed a bit I think oh okay well fuck off dude that was
[6979.22s -> 6982.34s]  I should have backed out the turret but I didn't think Karma was actually gonna do that
[6982.34s -> 6987.94s]  But I did overstay because you can see like this is the perfect example of why I overstayed so they stopped my back, right I?
[6988.94s -> 6991.48s]  Can give you guys a really good example of what just happens I
[6992.62s -> 6993.98s]  overstayed and
[6993.98s -> 6999.62s]  When I overstayed I didn't actually get anything out of it like I got what you saw I just have extra gold for nothing
[6999.74s -> 7005.66s]  So now I just have extra gold right and because I have extra gold the gin actually gets in that positive because they stopped
[7005.66s -> 7009.70s]  my back so he gets a free plate here I miss a cannon and even though I'm still
[7009.70s -> 7015.90s]  up 10 CS it's like I could have been up 10 CS not given a plate and not missed a
[7015.90s -> 7023.82s]  cannon so it's it's basically like it's interesting should you get prior for your
[7023.82s -> 7031.36s]  jungler every game no no that's not important some games prior was important
[7031.36s -> 7035.48s]  it's very important some games but you don't need to always be thinking
[7035.48s -> 7038.96s]  about getting prior for jungler that's not something you should be like
[7038.96s -> 7041.76s]  thinking about like always right like you think about it in terms of like
[7041.76s -> 7046.52s]  timers that's important but prior for jungler always is not like something you
[7046.52s -> 7056.46s]  should be worrying about because if you're perma shoving and you're like oh
[7056.46s -> 7060.66s]  I have prior for my jungler but then your jungler doesn't do anything like having
[7060.66s -> 7065.79s]  that prior would if you don't have pride it doesn't do anything like I'd
[7065.79s -> 7102.14s]  rather hold the wave in like a certain spot oh my god I suck I mean it
[7102.14s -> 7109.58s]  worked out I think if I was six I triple kill them there but I think we
[7109.58s -> 7113.78s]  actually almost I think we actually triple kill them too if Lulu helps me but
[7113.78s -> 7160.68s]  again you guys know what I'm gonna say I go back to the thing I don't know if
[7160.68s -> 7183.53s]  Rengar has ulti or not I want to shove this because chill I want to shove it in
[7183.53s -> 7186.69s]  for a second and I really don't have anything to do so I'll just stand here
[7186.69s -> 7188.93s]  You want to also be back backed
[7189.75s -> 7193.97s]  What's the tip for when they buy boots? I bought boots a fellow as you can buy boots really early
[7193.97s -> 7200.03s]  He's like he's a champion where the more attacks you do is actually very valuable and positioning on a fellow
[7200.03s -> 7202.03s]  This is very important. It's kind of like
[7202.81s -> 7207.43s]  Some AD carries like you don't need boots really early like like with like Jinx for example
[7207.43s -> 7213.95s]  I usually go free boots, right or I go boots like after my Kraken, but with a fellow us I
[7213.95s -> 7217.85s]  I really like the early mobility the early trading
[7218.45s -> 7224.47s]  Stuff like that's
[7224.47s -> 7227.97s]  Okay, so always be watching the map to we see the Rengar's top, right?
[7228.47s -> 7231.01s]  We can actually just straight fight these guys to be to right now
[7232.99s -> 7245.77s]  What wait what what's my Lulu doing homie what what are we he's alting us
[7256.75s -> 7258.75s]  So you're saying
[7258.75s -> 7261.75s]  Helping the AD carry is bad. Got it.
[7261.75s -> 7271.94s]  I can't believe my Lulu just walked away from me
[7271.94s -> 7276.44s]  and just like watched, like, you work as a team.
[7276.44s -> 7279.94s]  This is something that I cannot stress enough.
[7279.94s -> 7286.95s]  Play as a team when you play League of Legends.
[7286.95s -> 7290.95s]  This tilts me more than anything because this happens even in Grandmaster.
[7290.95s -> 7294.95s]  I see teammates who will be selfish and not help each other.
[7294.95s -> 7304.79s]  just help each other help each other please man we are a team don't just run
[7304.79s -> 7312.05s]  and leave your ADC like I'm not even flaming you but like dude you can't do
[7312.05s -> 7318.49s]  that you can't be upset that like I can't dodge every spell right welcome to
[7318.49s -> 7321.93s]  the league I feel like something that I noticed that happens a lot in the league
[7321.93s -> 7327.65s]  that is players will have this weirdly high expectation for everyone to play
[7327.65s -> 7334.09s]  absolutely perfect at all times and and they want me to like be gumi assi and I'm
[7334.09s -> 7340.55s]  like dude I dodged two of the gin bullets I dodged a karma queue like you
[7340.55s -> 7343.61s]  literally like I can't dodge literally everything will slow right like that's
[7343.61s -> 7387.15s]  not how it works like dude I'm gonna lose my mind with this guy my Lulu is
[7387.15s -> 7403.04s]  blaming me. It's okay. It's okay. I don't need to be upset. It's fine. The Lulu player
[7403.04s -> 7415.74s]  is totally okay. You know, sometimes people think they're right. It's just what happens
[7415.74s -> 7443.30s]  in the worlds. Right? It's just, it is what it is. No big deal. Sorry, I'm trying really
[7443.30s -> 7448.98s]  hard to not be an asshole right now. This Lulu player is making me like, making me one
[7448.98s -> 7453.98s]  of like fun Thanos. You know what I mean? Like this guy is like making me, like this
[7453.98s -> 7460.48s]  guy, like we talk about, like in League, we talk about like the players, like we talk
[7460.48s -> 7467.68s]  about AD carry players having ego. I genuinely think support players have five times the
[7467.68s -> 7476.10s]  ego AD carry players have, but with like a third of the skill. I think AD carry
[7476.10s -> 7483.78s]  players do have massive egos but again I don't think that like I think support
[7483.78s -> 7488.46s]  players are genuinely the dumbest motherfucking humans on the planet and they
[7488.46s -> 7492.18s]  think that they're the best players to ever touch the game and it hurts my
[7492.18s -> 7524.02s]  fucking balls hey Lulu would you be willing to have a VOD review with me
[7524.02s -> 7528.90s]  in discord after the game let's just see I want to see if like this person
[7528.90s -> 7558.93s]  is willing to listen to reason let's see I'm trying to not tilt but it's really
[7558.93s -> 7565.97s]  frustrating because this player is playing specifically for KDA and they're
[7565.97s -> 7570.13s]  playing like they don't understand how like I can already tell you if I go look
[7570.13s -> 7574.61s]  at this person's OP.GG they only play for KDA I can tell you right now right
[7574.61s -> 7580.57s]  here this person plays only for KDA never takes any risks doesn't ever
[7580.57s -> 7586.27s]  Help their ad carry ever when they get behind doesn't ever to walk up to like try and fight doesn't do any of that
[7586.27s -> 7591.83s]  I can tell you right now without even looking at their OP IG from how this person plays that they have high KDAs
[7592.21s -> 7600.70s]  But really low win rate, but I don't want my entire stream to be be bitching about this Lulu
[7600.70s -> 7602.70s]  So we'll try and focus on how to win from this position
[7603.34s -> 7607.86s]  So I'm sure you guys get shitty supports too. So we'll try and focus on how to win from the current position we're in
[7619.89s -> 7625.13s]  Yeah, it doesn't get better. I mean, I'll be honest with you my Grandmaster supports on my main suck
[7625.13s -> 7629.89s]  Like it doesn't get better. They get better like mechanically at the game, right?
[7630.07s -> 7636.35s]  Like the higher elo supports get better mechanically, but they get work. They don't get better when like
[7637.19s -> 7641.69s]  It doesn't get better. It's always like you'll either have a really good support or you have somebody who sniffs glue
[7642.07s -> 7650.71s]  I'm just dead
[7650.71s -> 7673.58s]  Or I'm not dead
[7676.84s -> 7680.92s]  Honestly our biggest issue here is I need to get bloodthirster ASAP
[7681.46s -> 7683.46s]  Once I get BT the game gets a lot easier
[7683.46s -> 7696.44s]  We could kill this guy right now if the Lulu helps me we can actually the
[7696.44s -> 7700.52s]  straight kill these guys because I can ulti to heal myself right we have
[7700.52s -> 7706.12s]  Lulu ult I have ult to heal myself and I'm strong she has ignite I have ult I
[7706.12s -> 7713.96s]  have everything we could easily kill that that Taliyah right there I mean
[7713.96s -> 7723.76s]  yeah whatever man this is what I'm talking about again are you willing
[7723.76s -> 7738.68s]  to get into discord and vod review yes or no I mean I have to be honest with you
[7738.68s -> 7745.44s]  the reason this is frustrating is because as an adc player you want to be able to
[7745.44s -> 7750.52s]  rely on your support right you want to be able to make plays go in fight and
[7750.52s -> 7754.40s]  rely on your teammates because as an adc player you support an ad or like a duo
[7754.40s -> 7760.72s]  right like you want to play together no no man I'm not attacking you I'm
[7760.72s -> 7764.64s]  I'm saying let's discord after.
[7764.64s -> 7776.02s]  You can explain your POV and I'll explain mine.
[7776.02s -> 7778.86s]  Maybe we can like improve this player.
[7778.86s -> 7782.46s]  Like get them to be a better player and not ruin every game they play in.
[7782.46s -> 7791.20s]  Like that would be, that would be the goat.
[7791.20s -> 7810.12s]  Like that did not hit me by the way, that hitbox was BS, but I don't even understand.
[7810.12s -> 7817.12s]  Oh man.
[7817.12s -> 7825.43s]  This is the person's, by the way, this is the person's OPI.GG.
[7825.43s -> 7832.23s]  Average win rate, 50% win rate, like I said, has really good KDAs on all his champs, but
[7832.23s -> 7834.67s]  he doesn't win.
[7834.67s -> 7840.55s]  I'm telling you right now, the biggest thing in League, the fAKEST thing in League of
[7840.55s -> 7846.55s]  Legends is believing that you are a good player based on KDA.
[7846.55s -> 7854.67s]  If I go look at any challenger level support player right now, their KDAs will be like 4.
[7854.67s -> 7859.93s]  They'll still have good KDA, but it'll be like 4 and 3, and it'll be on, that's your
[7859.93s -> 7860.93s]  mutual.
[7860.93s -> 7864.23s]  I'm gonna be real with you right now, T.
[7864.23s -> 7870.39s]  This Lulu player, like, you could tell me that this person sniffed glue as a kid and
[7870.39s -> 7874.11s]  their parents never told them to stop, and I would believe you.
[7874.11s -> 7875.11s]  I'm not even meaning.
[7875.11s -> 7879.99s]  say that makes sense I mean like I said I don't even care I don't care if it's a
[7879.99s -> 7883.67s]  girl a guy the e-girl thing is like that doesn't bother me right like it could be
[7883.67s -> 7888.87s]  a girl a guy a pigeon they could they could fucking they could relate as a
[7888.87s -> 7896.49s]  fucking peanut in a in a fucking plane I don't care about that at all you
[7896.49s -> 7900.45s]  don't mean like say that shit doesn't bother me at all like them be like I
[7900.45s -> 7903.73s]  actually think it's stupid when people are like oh it's an e-girl ego like
[7903.73s -> 7907.69s]  I think that's dumb as shit because that argument's so crap
[7908.19s -> 7911.75s]  Cuz like I don't give a shit if it's a guy or girl because like you know what I mean
[7911.75s -> 7915.05s]  I'm more upset at the fact that this person is delusional than anything
[7915.85s -> 7928.32s]  That's like what's tilting me
[7928.32s -> 7930.32s]  Here I'm just gonna mute
[7930.58s -> 7935.46s]  We'll do one more game on this account after this game and I'm gonna mute from the start of the game for you guys
[7935.46s -> 7942.32s]  Okay
[7942.32s -> 7945.26s]  Dude if he didn't actually get me into the wall there
[7945.26s -> 7949.52s]  I tried to walk forward so that I wouldn't get condemned in the wall if he didn't stun me I kill him
[7949.98s -> 7953.10s]  Ah, that's annoying.
[7953.10s -> 7955.86s]  That was actually such a good hitbox for him.
[7955.86s -> 7970.59s]  My bad.
[7970.59s -> 7971.59s]  Nice.
[7971.59s -> 7972.59s]  Huge shutdown.
[7972.59s -> 7973.59s]  Nice job.
[7973.59s -> 7976.27s]  If you're wondering why I'm even here, by the way, I'm actually, I'm not trolling.
[7976.27s -> 7979.51s]  I'm trying to get this turret because this gives me a lot of gold.
[7979.51s -> 7982.23s]  At the moment, I'm not actually worth that much gold.
[7982.23s -> 7983.31s]  There's nothing going on on the map.
[7983.31s -> 7985.31s]  There's no objective or anything like that, right?
[7985.31s -> 7990.39s]  So I'm trying to push in top waves right now so that I can get gold to try and
[7990.39s -> 7993.27s]  hyper inflate my two item before this next dragon.
[7993.27s -> 7995.39s]  Because this next dragon's gonna be incredibly important
[7995.39s -> 7997.51s]  if we want any chance to win.
[7998.43s -> 8000.55s]  We have to win this next dragon.
[8000.55s -> 8002.03s]  And the only way for me to do that
[8002.03s -> 8003.95s]  is to either get really lucky
[8005.15s -> 8006.99s]  or go get some gold and a side win.
[8007.99s -> 8009.83s]  It's just support difference every game.
[8009.83s -> 8011.11s]  It is!
[8011.11s -> 8012.59s]  I wanna point this out.
[8012.59s -> 8015.95s]  This person is playing this victim complex bullshit.
[8015.95s -> 8016.79s]  Like, you know what I mean?
[8016.79s -> 8055.39s]  But it is, it is actually support death.
[8055.39s -> 8057.39s]  Sorry, I'm tilted. I'm playing bad this game.
[8058.89s -> 8061.89s]  I need to mute these players because these players are actually tilting me.
[8063.39s -> 8066.89s]  Like, I was fine with it before, but I'm actually getting a little irritated that's making me play bad.
[8067.89s -> 8069.89s]  So, I need to mute them so that I don't keep inting.
[8072.27s -> 8075.27s]  Like, it's affecting my gameplay and it's pissing me off.
[8077.21s -> 8078.21s]  That's just my bad.
[8085.97s -> 8087.47s]  T-Split, are you here? T?
[8088.97s -> 8090.97s]  Yo, T, message this Lulu.
[8091.47s -> 8094.47s]  I mean this in the nicest way. I don't even want to be toxic.
[8095.47s -> 8101.41s]  I genuinely want to use this for content.
[8101.41s -> 8103.69s]  This guy's been flaming me the whole game.
[8103.69s -> 8108.57s]  I want to use this for content to show you guys that it is so easy to tell people how
[8108.57s -> 8110.41s]  the game should be played.
[8110.41s -> 8117.23s]  So easy if you can communicate by talking.
[8117.23s -> 8119.95s]  Because this guy's been doing nothing but flaming me the entire game.
[8119.95s -> 8121.03s]  This Lulu, right?
[8121.03s -> 8123.19s]  But he's an absolute...
[8123.19s -> 8125.43s]  He played the lane completely bad.
[8125.43s -> 8128.79s]  Then he stopped trying to win.
[8128.79s -> 8129.79s]  Stop shielding me.
[8129.79s -> 8135.13s]  anything right after he played the lane bat then he started playing the victim
[8135.13s -> 8138.09s]  thing when I asked him to be a human and like come over and like help me and play
[8138.09s -> 8141.73s]  teamwork you gotta remember I didn't blame him a single time right like I
[8141.73s -> 8144.45s]  didn't say a single negative thing to this guy in game I said let's work as a
[8144.45s -> 8152.99s]  team he got upset like I genuinely think it'd be great content if I could
[8152.99s -> 8174.74s]  talk to this guy in discord and just like oh I'd be so good right dude I'm
[8174.74s -> 8181.00s]  I'm trying to kill these people guys that wasn't bad though we got 800
[8181.00s -> 8185.84s]  golden not the worst but I don't know if my team can stall this maybe if they
[8185.84s -> 8194.30s]  can like kill this they can stall it but now they're yeah that's that's gg that
[8194.30s -> 8236.82s]  was a disgusting tolly at w I'm gonna add him and he'll probably not add me
[8236.82s -> 8242.37s]  but I'm I might as well try this would be such a good learning
[8242.37s -> 8255.65s]  experience oh excuse me dude I've had like bad heartburn today I need to
[8255.65s -> 8265.39s]  take one of those heartburn pills what Lulu what man just say I just let it
[8265.39s -> 8271.51s]  Let it out, let it out, let it out, baby.
[8271.51s -> 8280.03s]  Yo, Lulu, let's just have a talk.
[8280.27s -> 8282.35s]  Yo, let's discord.
[8283.75s -> 8291.01s]  We can bottom of you since I'm so bad.
[8291.01s -> 8302.77s]  Yo, trust.
[8302.77s -> 8307.77s]  You just blamed everyone but yourself,
[8309.01s -> 8315.18s]  but you didn't play correctly at all.
[8315.18s -> 8318.14s]  You played lane completely wrong.
[8319.82s -> 8323.04s]  Didn't help each other.
[8323.04s -> 8325.74s]  Left people to die on repeats.
[8327.24s -> 8339.19s]  Then played victim.
[8339.19s -> 8366.24s]  I genuinely want to help you.
[8366.24s -> 8370.62s]  This guy screenshoted what I just said
[8370.62s -> 8382.60s]  and put it in the end game chat.
[8382.60s -> 8385.12s]  What is happening right now?
[8385.12s -> 8387.00s]  What is going on?
[8387.98s -> 8392.46s]  There is no way that this is not an NPC
[8399.66s -> 8405.48s]  There is no way this is not an NPC there's no way
[8407.30s -> 8418.54s]  There's no way it's Geronimo the mouth it is me. Yes
[8420.04s -> 8423.66s]  Bro, just come talk in discord. I'm not even gonna flame you
[8423.66s -> 8438.45s]  what does this even mean bro I don't think I've seen anybody more insecure in
[8438.45s -> 8453.17s]  my life bro you are so insecure it's cringe how insecure you are like oof
[8453.17s -> 8469.30s]  good luck man on the climb to masters but Jesus Christ that's sad oh god I
[8469.30s -> 8475.06s]  Dude, I don't even know what to say like I'm gonna be real. I was like, I'm not even gonna flame the guy, right?
[8475.06s -> 8479.02s]  I just genuinely want to like improve the community
[8480.82s -> 8485.10s]  Because that was three straight supports in a row. They didn't know how to play Lulu and
[8485.74s -> 8490.58s]  I'm not even gonna flame the guy's skill. He's not a Lulu player, right? He doesn't play Lulu. That's fine
[8490.86s -> 8498.46s]  But the issue was that I had with that guy specifically was that it's okay to be bad at the game, right?
[8499.30s -> 8503.36s]  There's nothing wrong with being bad at League, everybody has bad games, but when we're playing
[8503.36s -> 8507.48s]  a game together and you're saying it's winnable and you want to win the game, you can't pick
[8507.48s -> 8512.16s]  and choose who to like help win the game.
[8512.16s -> 8516.96s]  Like if I'm sitting there bot lane, we're both being dove by Jin and you're intentionally
[8516.96s -> 8523.04s]  trying not to take damage and not die because you want to value your KDA over everything
[8523.04s -> 8528.60s]  else so that I, you know what, hold on, let me think about this.
[8528.60s -> 8531.96s]  I think I figured this person out.
[8531.96s -> 8533.72s]  This person lives in delusion.
[8533.72s -> 8534.72s]  And I think I figured this out.
[8534.72s -> 8535.72s]  Let me explain this.
[8535.72s -> 8540.36s]  A lot of players do this, but I think I'm figuring this out as I'm thinking about this.
[8540.36s -> 8544.96s]  So this person has really good KDAs on their profile, right?
[8544.96s -> 8546.64s]  This eye-catching person.
[8546.64s -> 8549.64s]  They have really, really good KDAs on their profile, right?
[8549.64s -> 8555.44s]  This person doesn't ever take risks, doesn't ever do anything to try and win the game
[8555.44s -> 8562.24s]  outside of like just like existing and hitting buttons and what they do is they
[8562.24s -> 8566.96s]  will always have good KDAs and they will they will sit here and never like I
[8566.96s -> 8570.16s]  know why they're losing they will sit here and they will do this shit where
[8570.16s -> 8574.52s]  they have good KDAs they they don't ever die that much blah blah blah but what
[8574.52s -> 8579.72s]  they do is they lie to themselves and they say look how good my KDAs are if I
[8579.72s -> 8589.12s]  had better teammates I'd always win like I cracked the code actually that's
[8589.12s -> 8596.72s]  totally what it is. The players actually like play so safe and they play to like for statistics right?
[8596.72s -> 8602.56s]  They play like purely for the stats and then they can say that it was their team's fault that they
[8602.56s -> 8614.14s]  didn't win because they played really bad but they didn't die because I mean in theory I could
[8614.14s -> 8620.54s]  have a perfect KDA on every AD carry I play right all I'd have to do is literally walk walk up get
[8620.54s -> 8626.66s]  one kill and then afk and stand in the base the rest of the game and I could be like yo why is my
[8626.66s -> 8634.85s]  team not able to carry what's happening right like you could literally do that no I seriously think
[8634.85s -> 8640.77s]  the person's self gaslighting himself like I'm serious I think this person's like self gaslighting
[8640.77s -> 8644.69s]  where they they're like oh it's my team's fault every game right like they're always blaming
[8644.69s -> 8649.33s]  their team for their their their loses and their mistakes and shits and it's sad because like
[8650.13s -> 8653.89s]  there's a reason you're d2 and I'm not saying that to be toxic I'm saying that like you
[8653.89s -> 8655.95s]  you haven't improved in four years.
[8655.95s -> 8657.49s]  And you haven't improved because all you're doing
[8657.49s -> 8659.79s]  is playing to blame your team every single game
[8659.79s -> 8662.51s]  when I just saw like 500 mistakes that you made
[8662.51s -> 8671.68s]  that we could've won the game off of early game.
[8671.68s -> 8672.96s]  Here, I remember somebody wanted me
[8672.96s -> 8675.00s]  to play a Caitlyn game last game.
[8675.00s -> 8676.62s]  So we're gonna play Cait.
[8677.84s -> 8679.68s]  I don't remember who it was in the chat.
[8679.68s -> 8681.74s]  Somebody like two people said Cait,
[8681.74s -> 8684.24s]  but we'll do a Cait game for you guys.
[8684.24s -> 8703.33s]  I got you boys, don't worry.
[8703.33s -> 8706.17s]  All right, I'm gonna take Ghost Flash
[8706.17s -> 8707.49s]  because they have three melee champs,
[8707.49s -> 8713.51s]  4 melee champs, they have Recon Zed, Kled, Gragas, so I'm going to take Ghost Flash.
[8713.51s -> 8716.51s]  These are going to be my runes this game, I'm going to take a little more MR because
[8716.51s -> 8719.55s]  I don't think we're going to be fighting too much in lane, we're pretty much just going
[8719.55s -> 8723.83s]  to be poking them with Karma Kate, so I'm going to take a little bit of extra MR because
[8723.83s -> 8728.03s]  I'm going to be playing for mid-delay game, I'm just scaling.
[8728.03s -> 8738.53s]  And these are going to be the runes that I take, even classed on AD carry
[8738.53s -> 8740.71s]  or the easier to play ones.
[8740.71s -> 8744.19s]  In AD carry, I usually do, like when I'm playing on this account right now,
[8744.19s -> 8749.95s]  like my teaching accounts. It's a little lower MMR right? It's like D1 Low Masters. I usually
[8750.91s -> 8755.71s]  play AD carries that like the chat wants to see me play so that you guys can learn like good and
[8755.71s -> 8762.43s]  bad matchups and things like that. The last two games I got way too tilted by shitty support
[8762.43s -> 8766.51s]  players like egos and all that shit. I got way too frustrated and I played bad the last
[8766.51s -> 8770.67s]  two games. So we're gonna honestly I'm just gonna I think I'm just gonna mute these
[8770.67s -> 8775.23s]  people at the very start of the game normally i wouldn't suggest you meet people because like
[8775.87s -> 8780.11s]  playing as a team is really important uh because like you know you need to communicate and all
[8780.11s -> 8787.31s]  that shit but i am just like i'm gonna mute them because i i dude my mental is taking a
[8787.31s -> 8794.93s]  fucking hit right now so we're gonna just chill and play i i just don't know how to play nila
[8795.73s -> 8798.29s]  i think that was really good i just don't i don't know how to play her
[8798.29s -> 8808.24s]  I think she's a great champ, like I've been getting shit on by Nyla on my main account.
[8808.24s -> 8820.18s]  Like a lot of Grandmaster Nyla's have been dumpstering me.
[8820.18s -> 8824.02s]  I think she's just really good at abusing solo queue.
[8824.02s -> 8829.74s]  Like the issue with Nyla is from what I've seen all the losses I've had with Nyla, people
[8829.74s -> 8835.42s]  don't, it's like the thing I was telling you about before, people don't play aggressively
[8835.42s -> 8839.60s]  in the lower elos, like even in Grandmaster, people don't play like aggressively enough.
[8839.60s -> 8841.88s]  It sounds crazy to say that, but it's true.
[8841.88s -> 8845.32s]  They don't play aggressively enough in lane, so you can get away with just picking Nyla
[8845.32s -> 8846.80s]  and scaling.
[8846.80s -> 8849.88s]  And Nyla at like one item, you'll always be up in levels, right?
[8849.88s -> 8852.56s]  Because that's how the champion works.
[8852.56s -> 8858.28s]  The champion works, and like you'll always be up in levels because of her passive, so
[8858.28s -> 8861.92s]  you basically just like scale through existing.
[8861.92s -> 8862.92s]  It's pretty interesting.
[8862.92s -> 8870.73s]  Alright, so we're playing Kate Karma, oh I missed a minion because I suck.
[8871.45s -> 8873.45s]  I'm gonna ward this bush
[8874.57s -> 8876.57s]  Just because I don't want the Rakan in the bush
[8877.09s -> 8885.72s]  So now that the bush isn't warded anymore
[8886.34s -> 8890.22s]  Okay, what are the nice I was gonna say what I want to do is I actually want to play I
[8892.32s -> 8895.68s]  Suck I actually wanted to play. Oh, man. I'm so bad at Kate
[8895.68s -> 8900.46s]  I wanted to play on the top side of the wave so that I'm not standing near the bushes, right?
[8900.96s -> 8902.96s]  Because if you stand near the bushes
[8903.76s -> 8908.24s]  The Rakan can obviously like W me and I just get fucked so I'd rather play in a safer spot
[8909.48s -> 8911.48s]  Can't believe I missed 2 CS. I'm so fucking bad
[8912.36s -> 8916.64s]  Now I want to push in wave 3 and I want to go buy a call so I'm gonna ping to push
[8925.40s -> 8927.00s]  okay
[8927.00s -> 8929.62s]  So I actually want to back here, and I'm gonna go buy a call
[8930.12s -> 8932.12s]  So this is called a cheater recall
[8933.28s -> 8937.08s]  You usually have perfect CS to back on this timer
[8937.84s -> 8939.84s]  Go and you can go buy a call. Okay
[8940.32s -> 8944.32s]  This is like something that you can do if you're in a lane that's gonna be perma shoving
[8944.32s -> 8951.30s]  So what happens is the reason it's called the cheetah recall is because we push the wave in they had to stay and farm the wave
[8951.60s -> 8953.60s]  Right now watch
[8953.64s -> 8961.37s]  They have to push this wave in right now if karma was here instead of roaming this room is fine by the way
[8961.37s -> 8964.05s]  But if she was here instead of roaming she could actually hold the wave
[8965.17s -> 8970.41s]  And if you notice here, I don't actually miss that many minions right we're chilling now
[8974.89s -> 8978.93s]  We can slow push this we're safe. I should actually fast push this
[8978.93s -> 8985.07s]  because I wanted to bounce I don't want to so push this but I can't I can't fast
[8985.07s -> 8994.19s]  push this at level 3 by myself so we're just gonna chill
[8994.19s -> 8999.83s]  Kaelin's really good at abusing like early lane phase bullying just based on
[8999.83s -> 9004.99s]  like what our kit does we see Recon on the map top side you get you see that so
[9004.99s -> 9011.17s]  because we see Recon I can walk up a bit and we can play a little aggro here
[9011.17s -> 9022.48s]  You can kind of see like I don't have to play behind the minion wave. You see what I'm doing to this guy, right? I
[9023.48s -> 9034.09s]  Hate this game. We can quit we can we can forfeit. It's fun. I hate this game. I really hate this game
[9034.77s -> 9042.48s]  Dude, what is wrong with me right now? It's like my brain doesn't work. It's the 280 K nerf telling you
[9042.90s -> 9049.34s]  So we're cons gonna be bought right now. I
[9050.78s -> 9052.46s]  Know he's gonna be bought
[9052.46s -> 9054.46s]  So I need to be a little care
[9054.74s -> 9056.74s]  Now my karma is here
[9058.99s -> 9062.37s]  There we go. So you notice I didn't use any spells. I'm not I'm just chilling
[9065.54s -> 9066.86s]  dude
[9066.86s -> 9068.86s]  Are you kidding me, man?
[9068.94s -> 9074.26s]  I'm gonna be honest. I'm getting really tilted by these players now
[9074.76s -> 9076.76s]  Like the Recon W's in
[9077.08s -> 9080.00s]  They just stand there and watch me die
[9081.44s -> 9085.56s]  Okay, it's fine. Listen, I'm not gonna get too mad about it. It's fine. I should have flashed the knockup
[9085.56s -> 9089.16s]  I guess even though in reality I should never have to flash the knockup
[9089.16s -> 9092.20s]  But I should have flashed it because I can't trust the teammates
[9092.46s -> 9096.66s]  So what I'm saying is right there karma and fiddle were both right here. I was being chased down
[9096.90s -> 9101.50s]  They they stood here. They didn't they didn't walk up to do anything. They just stood and waited
[9102.58s -> 9105.26s]  That pisses me off because I hate when players
[9106.38s -> 9108.38s]  play
[9108.38s -> 9115.39s]  Selfish and scared. It's my biggest pet peeve. It drives me fucking crazy man
[9116.63s -> 9118.63s]  Sorry, I'm getting I'm losing my mind
[9119.31s -> 9126.36s]  Like it's so easy
[9126.42s -> 9129.70s]  It's fine though. I shouldn't have walked up and ego'd it. It's on me.
[9141.26s -> 9148.79s]  I want to slow-push this wave.
[9148.79s -> 9154.55s]  Yeah, I'm losing it.
[9154.55s -> 9157.99s]  This, by the way, would be an example of a bad time for Karma to roam. She needs to come back bot.
[9162.10s -> 9164.26s]  There's absolutely no reason for her to roam on that timer.
[9165.22s -> 9167.22s]  There's also no reason for her to be in that bush over there.
[9167.22s -> 9169.78s]  We should be playing up to try- We're playing Kate Karma, right?
[9170.42s -> 9172.66s]  We should be playing forward so that we can actually be aggressive.
[9173.86s -> 9177.30s]  Kate Karma's a lane bully lane. We don't want to sit here and just do nothing.
[9177.30s -> 9179.94s]  If you pick Karma, you want to be aggressive. You want to be playing up.
[9179.94s -> 9187.13s]  You want to be stunning you want to be doing like aggressive things playing the game we're level six
[9187.13s -> 9189.13s]  I'd really like to like go in yeah like
[9196.73s -> 9202.09s]  That was actually not bad by the karma. She w'd the Zaya and then I got to trap off of it. So that wasn't too bad
[9203.33s -> 9224.26s]  Not the worst not not bad. That was good. That was good
[9225.46s -> 9228.98s]  Really nice really nice. Okay, so I'm gonna back here because I don't want to overstay for the wave
[9229.38s -> 9244.79s]  I'm gonna grab boots
[9245.87s -> 9249.70s]  You don't I think a lot of it is too I
[9249.70s -> 9254.78s]  I think a lot of it is people get really scared when they like Rickon is really strong in this meta, right?
[9254.78s -> 9258.46s]  Like he's very very powerful. He's he's like numbers are a little too high right now
[9258.46s -> 9260.38s]  So like everything he does is just a little too good
[9260.70s -> 9265.78s]  So I think people get nervous around Rickon especially with Zaya because it's like when people would get nervous around non
[9265.78s -> 9269.22s]  Illusion the lane like plays itself. It's very strong. It's very hard to beat
[9269.58s -> 9272.26s]  But you can still see people making mistakes when they play the lane
[9272.26s -> 9283.73s]  So you got to watch for that type of stuff now a good way to play against a Zaya once you hit six is
[9283.73s -> 9294.41s]  is you don't want to... you don't want to ever walk melee range of her or give her
[9294.41s -> 9298.01s]  the ability to just kill you with the feathers. Your main goal here is gonna
[9298.01s -> 9303.09s]  be try and stay in a good spot when it comes to feathers. Like I want to be
[9303.09s -> 9306.93s]  to the side of her. The side of her is the best option like where she can't
[9306.93s -> 9310.05s]  pull in like I'll get hit by maybe a few but she can't pull in all of
[9310.05s -> 9316.97s]  them. That's a really key thing when playing versus her because I remember
[9316.97s -> 9320.31s]  Back of the day, I didn't know how to play Versaia, and I would always get fucking frustrated as shit
[9320.99s -> 9323.93s]  So Rakan's 5. I want to hit tab, see Rakan's 5
[9325.01s -> 9333.97s]  We shouldn't be able to die here. I want to push this wave in, but I also need to stay away from where the Rakan could be
[9334.47s -> 9338.22s]  So if you want to push waves in and reset the wave
[9340.00s -> 9343.96s]  Make sure that you're standing as far away as you can from where they can engage on you
[9344.34s -> 9353.69s]  Now they're about to be 6. Rakan is. So they have a really strong level 6. She has pickaxe and noon quiver
[9353.69s -> 9356.77s]  We do want to be a little hesitant here. We don't want to fight
[9358.21s -> 9360.67s]  Now I'm gonna kind of push this in a bit
[9361.49s -> 9367.01s]  We should have been spam pushing the whole wave because that's okay karma plays. We just push push push push
[9367.85s -> 9371.35s]  But we played that that early roam by karma
[9372.57s -> 9374.57s]  Kind of put us behind on that
[9375.17s -> 9377.17s]  It's not a big deal. It's just something that
[9377.69s -> 9379.69s]  We have to adjust
[9382.96s -> 9385.64s]  Why does this say 88 and this say 90?
[9385.64s -> 9410.95s]  Which one is it? Is it 88 or 90? I mean that guy is dead. I don't know what that
[9410.95s -> 9420.96s]  Karma's thinking but we probably have to give this Drake. I mean maybe we could
[9420.96s -> 9431.34s]  fight it if Fiddle had ulti but him not having ult, yeah there's no way. The
[9431.34s -> 9438.38s]  higher one counts ward kills. Why? I think that's so stupid. So they might
[9438.38s -> 9444.38s]  try and engage here unless they somehow know Fiddle's in the bush. Which
[9444.38s -> 9448.61s]  This would be impressive because we know it's not warded.
[9448.61s -> 9464.39s]  So that'd be pretty impressive if they knew that.
[9464.39s -> 9465.79s]  We could actually rift.
[9465.79s -> 9477.40s]  I'm just gonna ghost.
[9477.40s -> 9478.68s]  This is crazy.
[9478.68s -> 9479.68s]  What the fuck?
[9479.68s -> 9486.34s]  Oh, this is interesting.
[9486.34s -> 9487.34s]  They saw fed 100%.
[9487.34s -> 9488.58s]  Yeah, I don't know where though.
[9488.58s -> 9490.86s]  It must have- because he used this thing.
[9490.86s -> 9496.08s]  But he'll use his, uh, whatever it's called.
[9496.08s -> 9497.08s]  His effigy.
[9497.08s -> 9498.68s]  I'd have to go look.
[9498.68s -> 9503.16s]  One million.
[9503.16s -> 9506.30s]  Oh, I guess I didn't see it.
[9506.30s -> 9507.54s]  Uh, I should back.
[9507.54s -> 9509.10s]  I can get dove here.
[9509.10s -> 9514.42s]  Don't know where Gragas is like if Gragas happens to be like he ease over this wall or something. I think it don't really easy
[9514.42s -> 9516.42s]  I'm greeting really hard
[9517.12s -> 9519.12s]  Greeting usually gets you killed
[9519.14s -> 9520.74s]  typically I
[9520.74s -> 9524.02s]  Shouldn't be doing this
[9524.02s -> 9527.54s]  They're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right?
[9528.18s -> 9529.78s]  it's like
[9529.78s -> 9536.14s]  If you know something it's gonna be a bad habit you should not do it just cue the bush
[9537.90s -> 9540.18s]  Okay, that was I meant use like an actual cue
[9540.18s -> 9546.20s]  They could also be in the alcove so I'm a little hesitant, but it's fine
[9552.02s -> 9556.24s]  Okay, so the reason I stayed was because now I have my I have my mythic right
[9556.94s -> 9561.08s]  Because we we finished the coal and we finished the mythic at the same time or finished the wave so
[9562.76s -> 9570.38s]  Now I have two options I go gale force here to dodge a lot of their shits or I can do what sounds like a fun option
[9571.76s -> 9573.76s]  We're gonna do shield bow
[9574.18s -> 9577.04s]  I'm gonna show you guys why I like shield bow on Caitlyn
[9577.86s -> 9582.30s]  It's not the best mythic, but it's good into certain comps
[9583.46s -> 9585.46s]  If you don't want to get
[9587.46s -> 9589.46s]  Yeah
[9589.58s -> 9591.86s]  Because I have a lack ready this game. I don't have bloodline right
[9592.50s -> 9601.73s]  So I kind of want to go shield bow, and then I'm gonna end up going
[9602.49s -> 9604.49s]  Either IE or I'm gonna end up going
[9605.09s -> 9609.81s]  like bloodthirster seconds
[9609.93s -> 9611.93s]  I your BT
[9612.17s -> 9614.17s]  probably IE just because I
[9614.17s -> 9617.67s]  I think I think it's actually easier to go IE this game
[9618.17s -> 9628.40s]  But yeah, this is a kind of boring game. Our team's doing really well though. So we just chill
[9628.78s -> 9638.58s]  We got to be a little care
[9638.58s -> 9659.64s]  Okay, it was kind of hard to do anything there even though I got like a few autos on the Gragas
[9659.72s -> 9669.54s]  It's a little difficult to actually play the game there because if I walk up too far like see we're conser
[9669.54s -> 9677.03s]  If I walk up too far, I just get killed by Rakan. All right. I'm just gonna reset and go get boots
[9677.03s -> 9687.64s]  typically any carry is really fucking boring in games like this where you
[9687.64s -> 9697.09s]  can't really blow the game open oh I'm dead maybe wait Karma shield me I'm not
[9697.09s -> 9727.58s]  dead nice motherfucker Kobe'd me man here's it's like Kobe we can fight this
[9727.58s -> 9736.35s]  though they have no ults like this is actually fightable they have no Zyar
[9736.35s -> 9746.07s]  And no, uh, dragon star and this is also why it's really important that you relate to your team the cooldowns of your team
[9746.99s -> 9752.67s]  Remember that don't forget that if somebody uses a big cooldown tell your team because that was an illegal dragon
[9752.67s -> 9756.57s]  I'm right like they just that was one of the most illegal things. I've seen in a while
[9757.51s -> 9781.88s]  Homie completely griefed that that's another very very very important thing that you need to take away from playing
[9782.18s -> 9784.94s]  League and being like this is what I was saying about the teamwork and shit earlier
[9784.94s -> 9791.38s]  being good at the game is a lot of spreading knowledge as well right like
[9791.38s -> 9795.02s]  if you were if your team doesn't know if a flash is up or down you have to play
[9795.02s -> 9797.98s]  completely differently right like you got to think about the game in that in
[9797.98s -> 9801.26s]  terms of that as well like how many times have you seen like you know you're
[9801.26s -> 9804.14s]  like oh I can walk up here if this guy can't flash ult me or something right
[9804.14s -> 9814.86s]  it happens all the time I wonder if I can kill a duskblade Zed I don't know
[9814.86s -> 9838.23s]  I probably could. I should go mad. What do you think about Teemo and other top lane as AD carry?
[9838.23s -> 9855.07s]  I play Teemo AD carry when I'm playing for fun sometimes. It's okay. Yo go look on your game man.
[9855.07s -> 9860.99s]  So during the mid game as Caitlyn a few things that I can kind of teach you. This was kind of a
[9860.99s -> 9865.27s]  boring lane phase right like we didn't really do that much. The lane phase was essentially just
[9865.27s -> 9870.51s]  like we died once and then you know everything all hell broke was when you're
[9870.51s -> 9874.43s]  walk up the fights like this make sure that you're putting traps down in
[9874.43s -> 9887.66s]  places where the enemy has to walk just like that playing 80 playing Caitlyn is
[9887.66s -> 9891.02s]  not always about just like auto-ing and getting cues and shits if you noticed
[9891.02s -> 9895.38s]  during that fight I put two traps here two traps here I forced the enemy
[9895.38s -> 9902.21s]  team into like a location where they had to eat traps or they they can't
[9902.21s -> 9908.92s]  fight us right and even if like they avoid the traps they're still having to
[9908.92s -> 9913.56s]  like move their character in a very unique specific way that they probably
[9913.56s -> 9920.31s]  don't want to do so you should always be thinking where should I put these traps
[9920.31s -> 9923.55s]  down at the start of the fight not like how do I get autos off think about
[9923.55s -> 9926.83s]  using your traps to zone and to like control the team fight before the
[9926.83s -> 9932.27s]  fight starts rather than using it to do damage because they'll step in the
[9932.27s -> 9937.27s]  traps themselves people will just people are stupid they're bad people
[9937.27s -> 9942.23s]  aren't paying attention. Everything. I'm bad. You know what I mean? People can't pay
[9942.23s -> 9946.19s]  attention to every bush that you're putting traps in during a big fight. It's too much
[9946.19s -> 9968.61s]  attention span. Nobody has it. Nice. I'm gonna go grab this red. Oh, big tip for all
[9968.61s -> 9973.61s]  the AD carries in chat. Guys, I'm gonna tell you right now, once the 20 minute mark
[9973.61s -> 9979.69s]  happens in League, your jungler's camps are no longer his. I know. I know. Junglers
[9979.69s -> 9982.29s]  are gonna hate me for this, okay? Listen, if you're a jungle player and you're
[9982.29s -> 9986.81s]  like fuck this guy now I hate him listen you know it's true you know at 20
[9986.81s -> 9991.85s]  minutes your camps no longer like they're not yours anymore man okay like you
[9991.85s -> 9996.25s]  you you are full items at this point okay like I want to be honest you would
[9996.25s -> 10002.58s]  I'm taking your camps I'm trying to get my third item as fast as humanly
[10002.58s -> 10021.67s]  possible because 80 carries spike on three items extremely hard and I want
[10021.67s -> 10029.04s]  to walk top but we have no vision of this area so it's a little scary like
[10029.04s -> 10034.80s]  Like I said, I typically don't like to take jungles camps early game, ever, because like
[10034.80s -> 10039.60s]  that's why I say like at 20 minutes, usually you have two items at this point.
[10039.60s -> 10042.68s]  If you're like farming decent and you know, etc.
[10042.68s -> 10045.24s]  Sometimes it'll be faster, but usually it's around average of like you'll have your
[10045.24s -> 10049.11s]  items at this point.
[10049.11s -> 10073.74s]  Always be tabbing to the teamfights, even if you're farming as well.
[10073.74s -> 10074.74s]  Zed is in this bush.
[10074.74s -> 10079.74s]  Wait, where is he?
[10079.74s -> 10080.74s]  Wait, I'm stupid.
[10080.74s -> 10081.74s]  Where'd he go?
[10081.74s -> 10082.74s]  Oh, he died.
[10082.74s -> 10083.74s]  I killed him.
[10083.74s -> 10084.74s]  Wow.
[10085.42s -> 10087.42s]  Wow, I'm really smart. I
[10093.11s -> 10095.11s]  Like didn't notice that I killed that guy
[10095.91s -> 10097.59s]  I'm so dumb
[10097.59s -> 10111.22s]  80 carry brain right boys. I was like playing that so scared too because I was like I was like is he there
[10121.02s -> 10123.02s]  Pull the dragon out
[10123.86s -> 10129.18s]  Why ask this yesterday, but what do you guys think the coolest looking dragon is I swear it's the I
[10130.18s -> 10132.18s]  Think mountain Drake looks fucking sick
[10168.82s -> 10169.86s]  Welcome to the
[10169.86s -> 10171.86s]  Here you shall have the time to push mid, right?
[10173.70s -> 10176.50s]  That's mainly because we our karma just got picked off
[10178.78s -> 10183.66s]  And I don't want to give them the option of pushing the wave. So by pushing the lane
[10203.36s -> 10207.52s]  Nice by pushing the the lane in it takes away an option for the enemy
[10208.40s -> 10210.64s]  That's something that a lot of people think like oh, I just want farm
[10210.64s -> 10215.04s]  I don't care about the farm right like when I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game
[10215.04s -> 10220.80s]  And I'm pushing like a mid wave in before a fight if we're just sieging around the Baron
[10222.12s -> 10226.60s]  Having that wave pushed in gives them gives us another option. I'm like what we can do in the game
[10227.28s -> 10229.64s]  And it takes you three seconds to push it in so
[10230.48s -> 10232.48s]  if the fight's already over and
[10233.36s -> 10237.04s]  You have time always be paying attention to like trying to push in waves
[10237.48s -> 10242.76s]  So that you can create a little bit of that pressure. Yo, hail. Thanks so much for the 14 man. Welcome back
[10242.76s -> 10252.25s]  What do I get next? I kind of want to get BT. I'm gonna get BT. I could get Dom's
[10252.25s -> 10256.99s]  but I think BT's better because the I already have Overheal right so the shield
[10256.99s -> 10261.43s]  from BT plus shield bow plus IE I don't think I'll be able to die okay I
[10261.43s -> 10266.83s]  think I'm unkillable actually actually unkillable so here I'm gonna
[10266.83s -> 10269.47s]  actually give these camps to Fiddle cuz he's literally pathing to them I
[10269.47s -> 10291.62s]  don't want to be an asshole but wow what just happened I'm bad I feel like I got
[10291.62s -> 10299.38s]  hooked by Kled oh he flashed okay I was like I feel like what just happened
[10299.38s -> 10302.78s]  was like I mispositioned cuz like I went up here right like I ghosted one up
[10302.78s -> 10306.26s]  here cuz there was two people here two people here I put traps down these
[10306.26s -> 10309.70s]  kind of sloppy traps and then I positioned here and then Kled flashed
[10309.70s -> 10311.70s]  Cued me under the yeah, okay, that makes sense
[10312.46s -> 10315.92s]  I'm just bad
[10315.92s -> 10322.33s]  It was okay though cuz if the entire enemy team has to literally
[10325.19s -> 10330.37s]  Like double flash on you to kill you under the turret and then your team follows up. It's not that big of a deal
[10331.03s -> 10333.03s]  Gale force would have saved me there though. Actually
[10334.51s -> 10340.48s]  Loki gale force totally gonna save me
[10341.40s -> 10343.40s]  Because he has serpents
[10345.71s -> 10350.17s]  Serpents definitely shits on Chobo. I'm kind of stupid for going show by this game
[10350.87s -> 10352.87s]  I
[10353.07s -> 10357.71s]  Wanted to try it out because I when I before when I was playing Caitlyn like before the IE rework and everything
[10358.15s -> 10359.75s]  everybody would go
[10359.75s -> 10363.59s]  Or there was like one guy in Challenger would go shield bow into shit every game
[10363.59s -> 10368.71s]  And I wanted to see if like it was still viable, but there might just be better options now like always scale force a
[10369.71s -> 10376.16s]  BT or something. Oh my god. I flashed late. I'm dead
[10379.03s -> 10382.55s]  Dude, I flashed late for some reason. I'm so dumb
[10383.27s -> 10385.27s]  my bad
[10385.27s -> 10387.27s]  I was giving him an Mb.
[10387.27s -> 10390.27s]  Like, my brain is moving slowly.
[10390.27s -> 10392.27s]  Like, I can feel it turning.
[10392.27s -> 10394.27s]  I'm just playing bad.
[10394.27s -> 10398.27s]  Like, I was baiting the Kled to go in on me because Karma was there.
[10398.27s -> 10401.27s]  But what I need to do is I need to trap on top myself when he goes in.
[10401.27s -> 10405.27s]  Then I need to flash knit, and the Kled just dies.
[10405.27s -> 10408.84s]  You can also just kill him.
[10409.84s -> 10412.84s]  I was gonna say, they have nothing.
[10412.84s -> 10417.04s]  We just play for dragon here.
[10417.04s -> 10425.54s]  I don't know why I'm playing so bad today. I played bad yesterday too. I don't know what's going on
[10426.06s -> 10444.67s]  My like brain is broken
[10444.99s -> 10446.99s]  Dude, they're recon was trying so hard
[10460.23s -> 10490.37s]  Oh, I've made so many mistakes this game. I fucked up positioning mechanic farm
[10491.25s -> 10509.79s]  All kinds of shit. Uh, I still don't want Lord Dom's actually. I don't think Lord Dom's is good this game
[10510.63s -> 10515.15s]  Like they have no armor like quite as murk treads
[10515.15s -> 10532.60s]  which I feel like really bad indoor team but oh a little tip that you guys can
[10532.60s -> 10539.36s]  have for Caitlyn too when you are like Baron's up in 50 seconds right so a
[10539.36s -> 10542.36s]  little thing you can do that's actually kind of fun is you want to be at the
[10542.36s -> 10545.68s]  objective before the like rule with them one of the objectives coming up you
[10545.68s -> 10548.00s]  always want to be on that side of the map before the before the objective
[10548.00s -> 10557.48s]  comes up but you can put down traps in the bushes around the objectives and people
[10557.48s -> 10562.12s]  will face check them and you can just one tap them away game it's actually
[10562.12s -> 10569.22s]  incredibly fun but you just put them in the corners of the bushes where people
[10569.22s -> 10590.30s]  have to walk like right here I can put it right between the turret I don't know
[10590.30s -> 10597.49s]  why I didn't ghost I'll be honest I have no idea why didn't ghost I was
[10597.49s -> 10604.53s]  like saving it for something I'm not sure what next year a birthday present who
[10604.53s -> 10613.76s]  the fuck knows oh I could have one shot that guy if I was better at Kate I did a
[10613.76s -> 10619.10s]  really classic combo right there I just didn't queue cuz I'm bad I should have
[10619.10s -> 10622.06s]  when he hit the trap your two headshots sit on him for a few seconds so what I
[10622.06s -> 10624.70s]  should have done is I should have instantly queued on top of the trap then
[10624.70s -> 10627.94s]  auto-autoed and he would have died cuz your queue does the max damage when
[10627.94s -> 10632.26s]  they're trapped too so it would have been like just a perfect three shot but
[10632.26s -> 10636.34s]  I said I don't play Kate enough and my muscle memories kind of trash sometimes so
[10637.66s -> 10653.50s]  That was my bed. Oh, we're getting cluttered. I don't know where he is, but I
[10671.12s -> 10672.62s]  Shouldn't have done that
[10672.62s -> 10678.85s]  I'm limit testing really hard right now. I suggest you guys don't limit test
[10678.85s -> 10680.33s]  Well, actually I do think you should limit test
[10680.33s -> 10682.89s]  But not if you want to win like play safer like right there
[10682.89s -> 10687.61s]  The play wasn't to go back in the play was the like back off, but I wanted to see if I could like I
[10690.28s -> 10692.28s]  Wanted to see if I was terrible or not
[10693.68s -> 10700.08s]  you know I was but yeah I mean the combo with Kate is like if they're trapped
[10700.64s -> 10706.64s]  you want to queue while they're in the trap essentially because your auto will always give
[10706.64s -> 10713.52s]  you the range so if you auto and then queue um when when they're trapped they get uh not
[10713.52s -> 10718.72s]  a lot of people know this because I just found this out like a few years or like after I should
[10718.72s -> 10726.00s]  of uh when you queue on top of a k-trap the way k8s queue works is when you queue the initial
[10726.00s -> 10730.80s]  like it hits initially and then it does less damage to the targets behind it right it's very
[10730.80s -> 10736.64s]  narrow and then it likes it like gets bigger so when they're trapped though it does the maximum
[10736.64s -> 10741.28s]  queue damage that it can do in like the isolation of the queue so that's why when people are
[10741.28s -> 10748.07s]  trapped you want to open up with your queue you either want to net into the queue and then
[10748.07s -> 10754.95s]  double auto or you want to net or you want to like you want to queue then trap net at the same time
[10754.95s -> 10760.31s]  then double auto you basically it's a very interesting way to play you always want to try and overlay a
[10760.31s -> 10766.71s]  trap on your trap so when they get trapped you can overlay a second trap to either in front of them
[10766.71s -> 10770.95s]  or behind them and what will happen is there's actually like a little mini like I want to say
[10770.95s -> 10776.07s]  one second uh cooldown of being able to be trapped right like a little 1.52 second cooldown
[10776.07s -> 10779.75s]  But what can happen is they sit in the trap then what you can do is your net can slow them
[10780.15s -> 10786.31s]  So you can you can actually cue in the first trap then you can drop a second trap net slow them into the second
[10786.31s -> 10790.15s]  Trap and then triple auto headshot them from all three of the net the two traps
[10790.87s -> 10792.87s]  It's really complicated sounding
[10796.88s -> 10802.87s]  but
[10802.87s -> 10806.31s]  This man does redeemed end my stream whenever you want
[10813.46s -> 10817.11s]  What?
[10817.11s -> 10821.97s]  Why?
[10821.97s -> 10823.97s]  Why would you want to end my stream right now?
[10829.49s -> 10837.99s]  Why would you want to be that guy?
[10838.23s -> 10839.43s]  Wow. Okay.
[10850.24s -> 10853.04s]  Don't change- Don't end, just change the camera position.
[10854.54s -> 10857.14s]  Did you just spend one million points
[10859.59s -> 10863.59s]  to tell me to put the camera back on the right side of my fucking-
[10869.14s -> 10870.44s]  No way.
[10872.04s -> 10873.94s]  No way you just did that.
[10878.10s -> 10880.60s]  I was like, this man is just flexing.
[10881.20s -> 10883.50s]  He's just like, yeah, I got some points to spare.
[10883.80s -> 10886.00s]  I guess I could like throw him, you know, eh.
[10889.61s -> 10890.21s]  All right, fine.
[10901.63s -> 10913.22s]  There's that better is that better drink water. Actually, that's a good one. I'll be our beer. I'm gonna get some water
[10915.95s -> 10919.13s]  Should we plan our main? I kind of want to try and hit GM
[10919.95s -> 10923.43s]  Yeah, let's get on our main account. It's like 1 p.m. So it's like 3 p.m. Eastern. I
[10924.27s -> 10925.63s]  think I
[10925.63s -> 10927.71s]  Can get cues at the moments
[10928.15s -> 10934.39s]  Let me get some water and then we'll queue up or we'll queue up then get some water real quick
[10934.69s -> 10946.50s]  Because I think I think it's late enough than day I can get cues now without waiting 40 minutes
[10946.50s -> 10956.90s]  by the way it is it is a teaching stream when I'm doing that like 80 carry
[10956.90s -> 10959.78s]  academy thing so if you guys have any questions you want to ask or like you
[10959.78s -> 10962.54s]  guys can ignore that if you guys have any questions you want to ask or anything
[10962.54s -> 10966.46s]  like that you know if we're just chilling between games just ask whatever you want
[10966.46s -> 10971.82s]  I'll I can answer a lot easier between games that I can't in-game you know
[10971.82s -> 10974.42s]  it's a lot easier for me to see that shit I try and answer in-game but
[10974.42s -> 10985.29s]  like sometimes I'm like focusing and shit so it's a little harder I am
[10985.29s -> 10991.01s]  gonna get some water though so I'll be right back okay talk amongst yourselves
[10991.01s -> 10997.13s]  is Kraken troll on Kate no Kraken's good on Kate you can go Kraken into
[10997.13s -> 11001.33s]  bloodthirster or Kraken in the IE if you really need it if if they have like
[11001.33s -> 11006.13s]  tanks so they have like Scion, Sejuani, stuff like that you have to like you're
[11006.13s -> 11009.17s]  the only damage let's say you're like the only tank killer on the team you're
[11009.17s -> 11011.87s]  The only 80 damage you have to go cracking sometimes
[12198.66s -> 12201.66s]  I just want to say that the
[12201.66s -> 12202.66s]  the
[12202.66s -> 12204.66s]  the
[12204.66s -> 12206.66s]  the
[12206.66s -> 12208.66s]  the
[12208.66s -> 12210.66s]  the
[12210.66s -> 12212.66s]  the
[12212.66s -> 12214.66s]  the
[12214.66s -> 12216.66s]  the
[12216.66s -> 12218.66s]  the
[12218.66s -> 12223.31s]  the
[12223.31s -> 12225.31s]  the
[12225.31s -> 12227.31s]  the
[12227.31s -> 12229.31s]  the
[12229.31s -> 12232.41s]  and I'm playing into like, I don't know.
[12232.41s -> 12234.99s]  Let's say I'm playing into like Kaisalulu, okay?
[12234.99s -> 12236.27s]  You can take free boots.
[12236.27s -> 12238.23s]  You don't need early boots in that matchup
[12238.23s -> 12240.47s]  because it's an enchanter farm AD carry
[12240.47s -> 12242.95s]  versus an enchanter farm AD carry, okay?
[12242.95s -> 12245.49s]  Now, if I'm versus, let's say I'm versus like a Blitzcrank.
[12245.49s -> 12247.99s]  Let's say I'm playing Jynx and I'm versus Blitz.
[12247.99s -> 12249.67s]  Like I typically don't want to have to wait
[12249.67s -> 12250.83s]  till nine minutes to get boots
[12250.83s -> 12253.03s]  because Blitzcrank's gonna shit on me.
[12253.03s -> 12256.75s]  So I will take different runes versus that Blitzcrank
[12256.75s -> 12261.87s]  allow myself the option of like let's say I have 1100 gold and I back I can get
[12261.87s -> 12271.59s]  early boots and now the Blitzcrank has a much harder time. Dude I almost want to
[12271.59s -> 12275.95s]  ban Zed because I don't want to get shit on by stylish but I think it's cringe. I
[12275.95s -> 12296.40s]  don't want to like ban stylish outs. How often does AD carry bot do you play
[12296.40s -> 12302.91s]  parallel to your support? You try to always. Essentially the perfect way to
[12302.91s -> 12307.39s]  play bot lane is you're both hitting one target at the same time trading on
[12307.39s -> 12310.69s]  one target at the same time you're making like a little triangle and you're
[12310.69s -> 12312.91s]  both just like standing next to each other and you're both hitting that one
[12312.91s -> 12318.19s]  target right that's the best way to play bot lane but it's very hard in solo queue
[12318.19s -> 12325.02s]  obviously to do that but if you have like a duo you can practice it sorry it went
[12325.02s -> 12330.66s]  down the wrong pipe 80 carry tier of us I should make one I have this thing where
[12330.66s -> 12338.00s]  even though I'm like grandmaster level I still think I suck I have this like
[12338.00s -> 12340.94s]  running lack of confidence because I used to be challenger and now I'm like
[12340.94s -> 12346.18s]  hard-stuck GM so like I have this lack of confidence in what I'm talking about so
[12346.18s -> 12349.42s]  like I feel like if I were to make a tier list it would be based on like a GM
[12349.42s -> 12354.70s]  players skill and I don't know if like I don't want to get ripped apart by people
[12354.70s -> 12376.68s]  but I guess I could make a tier list from my own opinion like let me see
[12376.68s -> 12412.86s]  tier list maker I'm sure there's a tier list maker with champions right yeah
[12412.86s -> 12423.45s]  there it is wait this is terrible what is what are these pictures I'm just
[12423.45s -> 12425.45s]  What what is this? What is this?
[12426.89s -> 12441.86s]  Why is Niko on here? I want to use this one, but this one doesn't have Zary
[12441.86s -> 12450.10s]  I'm trying to find one with Zary on it that doesn't look like shit. It says this one has Zary
[12450.84s -> 12467.62s]  But it looks like it looks shitty. I don't I don't enjoy that hold on. We're gonna play ash this game because they picked Zareth
[12468.38s -> 12471.58s]  Like I just saw him first pick Zareth, so I want something that can engage on the Zareth
[12473.26s -> 12474.86s]  So we're gonna go ash
[12474.86s -> 12492.01s]  These gonna be my ashrines this game boys. Um, so I'm gonna go presence of mind. I don't know I kind of do but I kind of don't I
[12492.73s -> 12502.09s]  Think presence of mind kind of sucks. It feels kind of shitty. Hmm. We can just do overkill
[12503.17s -> 12507.06s]  We can go Lackardy. I
[12507.32s -> 12510.22s]  Probably won't go crack inside of this game. So we could probably just go Lackardy
[12511.92s -> 12522.82s]  Even though crack inside is not battle Nash, I kind of want to go board crush, but I could go
[12522.82s -> 12531.34s]  I actually don't know what I want to take if I want to take borderline or a Lackardy. I'm gonna take a Lackardy
[12531.34s -> 12533.02s]  We'll try it out
[12533.02s -> 12535.02s]  And then we'll do ghost. Okay. Um
[12535.94s -> 12537.94s]  Was I gonna say? Oh
[12538.66s -> 12547.35s]  Yeah, yeah, I need to find the right tier list. I mean I could just use this right I
[12548.67s -> 12559.31s]  Can't where's Zerry? Oh? Oh, there we go
[12560.67s -> 12564.79s]  Yeah, this is good. Okay. I was like I was trying to figure it out. I was like what the fuck I
[12564.79s -> 12570.30s]  I think just straight out of the gate. I was putting Jinx in S tier. I
[12571.40s -> 12574.72s]  Think Jinx is just an S tier champion. She's crazy OP
[12576.48s -> 12584.06s]  Like Jinx just does whatever champion wants to do but like better than them she's blind pickable her two item three items bike is crazy
[12585.02s -> 12589.22s]  She's doesn't have a lot of like really bad matchups and lane phase anymore
[12589.78s -> 12592.98s]  They gave her scaling like crazy high like she's just good
[12592.98s -> 12597.08s]  Good build paths, etc. I guess she's just a good champion
[12597.08s -> 12605.53s]  I would say it's also hard to do tier list because you have to do tier list for like low elo and high elo, right?
[12605.81s -> 12608.11s]  Because if I'm doing like a low elo tier list
[12608.77s -> 12610.77s]  You're putting a math like here
[12611.61s -> 12615.65s]  Right like MF super good, but if you're doing a high elo tier list MF's like here
[12617.13s -> 12623.97s]  It's it's hard to explain and like in low elo I'm putting Kalista here, but in high elo I'm putting her here
[12624.93s -> 12633.01s]  So it's it's really interesting right because it's all based on like people's
[12633.01s -> 12639.25s]  mechanical skill too but yeah we do the tier list between games I guess so far I
[12639.25s -> 12645.94s]  think Jinx is definitely S tier I wish there was like an S plus tier but Jinx
[12645.94s -> 12650.58s]  is definitely S tier. Draven's hard to choose for me like I want to put him in
[12650.58s -> 12654.90s]  A tier because he has a lot of counter matchups but in solo queue Draven
[12654.90s -> 12663.82s]  feels insane so it's hard because I don't think Draven's overrated personally because
[12663.82s -> 12670.48s]  I know how to beat Draven players but I also think in high elo when people also know how
[12670.48s -> 12680.45s]  to deal with Draven players the game, I also do feel like good Draven players and good people
[12680.45s -> 12684.57s]  who know how to play around Draven players make Draven OP but it's also the opposite
[12684.57s -> 12687.87s]  where good players who know how to play around Draven can counter pick Draven and
[12687.87s -> 12707.47s]  make him worthless so it's it's really it's really hard all right let me say
[12707.47s -> 12720.80s]  morgana versus a moo moo e moo moo gin players gin players are psychopaths man
[12720.80s -> 12725.66s]  like I I don't think Jin's very good right now I think he could be good if
[12725.66s -> 12728.72s]  they gave him like a quality life change isn't he getting buff next patch I
[12728.72s -> 12737.69s]  think he's getting buffed I think he should do like Jin's such a fun
[12737.69s -> 12752.38s]  He's just like a little shitty. We can actually just straight fight them right now if I'm a mood just cues
[12755.75s -> 12766.19s]  Because Morgana's worthless level one the guy actually just straight up want to fight these guys right now
[12768.24s -> 12782.07s]  Go go go. Oh, he missed both his cues
[12783.07s -> 12789.33s]  Dude this guy. This is a Moomoo's killing me man. Oh my god. I
[12791.09s -> 12796.94s]  Bro, what am I watching? What are these cures brother?
[12805.81s -> 12807.81s]  All right, I should have taken longsword
[12809.57s -> 12835.01s]  The moon who is not feeling himself today. Let me tell you what he is not feeling himself chase
[12835.83s -> 12837.83s]  Even if as comes chase
[12838.15s -> 12847.85s]  Okay, we run. I don't know if we can fight this we can try
[12849.31s -> 12863.99s]  I'll folly
[12863.99s -> 12865.99s]  Well, I mean that guy should die
[12872.10s -> 12874.66s]  Dude, what I don't even know what's happening right now. This is
[12875.30s -> 12876.90s]  This is crazy
[12876.90s -> 12884.45s]  This is this is ridiculous both mid laners just got like three kills out of nowhere
[12884.97s -> 12899.04s]  We went from like a ridiculously we went from like a grandmaster game to like a diamond game
[12899.74s -> 12901.38s]  like somehow
[12901.38s -> 12906.77s]  Like the emu moves like it kind of whiffing some shit. I
[12907.93s -> 12912.47s]  Took a bad trade early then fucking this shit is funny as fuck
[12913.01s -> 12918.01s]  So I'm gonna I'm gonna actually rush tier two boots this game
[12919.29s -> 12921.29s]  Because I actually really
[12921.57s -> 12923.57s]  really really
[12923.73s -> 12925.73s]  Want to be mobile against their team?
[12925.97s -> 12931.47s]  Like I'm just gonna straight up leave go buy t2 boots and that's gonna be my my power spike for ash right now
[12931.87s -> 12937.29s]  They have so many things that I can dodge on their team like look at the shit right like
[12937.77s -> 12942.27s]  Morgue binding t2 boots super easy to dodge if she can't flash on me, right?
[12942.27s -> 12947.05s]  Or if she can't flash melee range that Morgue bind. It's I should never get hit by it unless I have no fingers
[12947.69s -> 12949.69s]  Ezreal Q easy to dodge
[12949.69s -> 12953.69s]  Zerath, easy to dodge, this guy, whatever the fuck,
[12953.69s -> 12958.19s]  Kha'Zix, Bugman, he's a melee champ, so boots have value, etc.
[12958.19s -> 12967.21s]  Also, the cool thing about boots, boots rush Ashe, is she doesn't have damage
[12967.21s -> 12972.41s]  that if I'm good at spacing, like the better at spacing you are,
[12972.41s -> 12978.81s]  you can actually just 1v2, especially against double skill shots like this.
[12978.81s -> 13007.75s]  It's pretty fun. Fuck if I juke that last Q I would have killed that guy
[13008.39s -> 13014.31s]  Dude Zerath actually fucked us so bad though. That was a good fight until Zerath just showed up and beat our ass
[13014.99s -> 13027.96s]  Yeah, just get the just get the minion wave
[13028.20s -> 13036.24s]  It's kind of funny to watch though because I do so little damage, but I also like just perma
[13036.84s -> 13038.84s]  Slow so they can't do anything about it
[13041.63s -> 13045.71s]  Hopefully when TF gets six he can come bot and we can fuck over their ball in
[13045.71s -> 13049.07s]  I'm hoping that that's the case
[13055.66s -> 13064.16s]  We're gonna roam to mid Cosyx is also mid tf dead. That's a good room
[13064.54s -> 13072.49s]  I'm gonna push this so that maybe we can play for a dragon
[13072.93s -> 13079.42s]  Because they might go for a dragon here, and I think we can stop it. We have tf ults
[13084.02s -> 13089.20s]  Yep. Nice. We just leave
[13090.20s -> 13093.76s]  We don't need to actually chase or doing crazy. We're just stopping the dragon. That's all we're doing
[13095.12s -> 13103.83s]  Right, we don't want to give him a free drink see the t2 boots are just broken
[13103.83s -> 13105.27s]  They're broken as shit
[13105.27s -> 13113.97s]  Because you can just see like I can I can pretty much just
[13114.61s -> 13116.61s]  I'm just too fast for them to deal with
[13116.89s -> 13121.42s]  Like look at this. It's it's insane
[13122.06s -> 13134.39s]  And that's why I value like the tier 2 boots on champions
[13134.39s -> 13139.47s]  Especially like ash where you can be extra egregious with it because like her slow
[13140.47s -> 13144.43s]  Imagine it's like, you know, it's the same idea as vain right when you think about it. It's like, okay
[13144.43s -> 13148.47s]  So what's really annoying trying to run away from a vein, right?
[13148.47s -> 13153.79s]  She gets boots too, and you're like god damn it man. She's so fast same thing with Ash. Oh, we now you're slow
[13154.87s -> 13157.43s]  So it's even more annoying you try and you try and go in on her
[13157.43s -> 13163.21s]  She just spaces you walks away a bit now you're just sitting there waddling towards her slowly just upset tilted frustrated
[13164.43s -> 13166.43s]  You know it's like your middle school dance
[13166.91s -> 13190.88s]  You know what I think this is actually a shield bow game
[13192.44s -> 13196.48s]  It is I was gonna go Bork, but I think this is a shield bow game
[13196.48s -> 13201.12s]  It could be a gale force game to both both are both are viable
[13202.40s -> 13206.82s]  But uh, I actually I might be one of the I might be in the minority here with this
[13206.82s -> 13210.78s]  I think Bork rush on ash is actually good sometimes
[13212.04s -> 13216.08s]  Like I think if I was versus some tanks like you know like a scion or something like that
[13216.08s -> 13218.38s]  I actually think Bork rush on ash is kind of cracked
[13219.54s -> 13224.02s]  Like yeah, it stalls out like you make the argument like it stalls out your three item or your two item
[13224.02s -> 13230.42s]  but it's it feels kind of nuts also this is a really op thing that you can do I
[13230.42s -> 13234.70s]  should have hawk shot it sooner I knew that they were doing rift but I'm not
[13234.70s -> 13245.19s]  paying attention as much as I should be so because what you can do is you can
[13245.19s -> 13249.07s]  hawk shot to tell your team where the enemy jungler is and get information
[13249.07s -> 13259.07s]  yourself I mean this Morgana's level five we could fight just because morgue
[13259.07s -> 13276.03s]  is five right now I kind of want to try my mumu didn't want to go in my bed I'm
[13276.03s -> 13280.79s]  a little sad I'm not gonna lie because I do feel like we win these fights but a
[13280.79s -> 13285.71s]  mumu wants to wait for six which is fine but like I said you guys know me I
[13285.71s -> 13290.03s]  like to actually fight and be active in the lane early because I know that we
[13290.03s -> 13304.37s]  can fight right and so it's like obviously you know ooh this is really
[13304.37s -> 13311.84s]  rough I can't do anything cuz Zerat's here
[13311.84s -> 13316.60s]  TF's coming with ult though I don't have ult damn it if I had ult this would be
[13316.60s -> 13323.47s]  so god tier god you have no idea how OP this would be if I had ulti man
[13323.47s -> 13329.32s]  whatever I'm bad I want to push this wave out I'm assuming they're all
[13329.32s -> 13335.04s]  backing I think we penta there it was all we even killed the top laner oh I'm
[13335.04s -> 13341.96s]  dead why did I stay I knew Cosyx would do that I have to retrain my brain
[13341.96s -> 13345.28s]  Cosyx players are rats and I have to retrain my brain to remember that they
[13345.28s -> 13349.60s]  will sit in a bush for 30 minutes lose all of their farm to get one kill I
[13349.60s -> 13362.04s]  like always forget that like Cosyx players are absolute fucking rats like
[13362.04s -> 13368.00s]  I respect Rengar players more than Kha'zix players. Yeah, I said it. I know hot take. I know but I do
[13368.36s -> 13373.53s]  I'm gonna try and arrow right here
[13376.98s -> 13381.84s]  Got him. You know that guy's pissed by the way
[13383.20s -> 13392.10s]  God damn it. He's gonna try and ult me from the bush
[13393.30s -> 13397.18s]  You can always tell that you're about to get ulted when an Ezreal big big tip for you guys
[13397.30s -> 13401.58s]  If an Ezreal ever walks out of vision, expect that he's ulting you.
[13401.58s -> 13409.34s]  I you would not believe you would not believe the amount of people that I kill with Ezreal by simply walking into a bush and
[13409.34s -> 13411.66s]  Ulting them and they forget that I exist
[13412.66s -> 13415.38s]  I'm not I'm not even it happens so often
[13416.30s -> 13419.30s]  They're just like oh, yeah, he went in the bush. He's gonna hit his old key
[13420.02s -> 13423.26s]  Like I it is comical how often it happens
[13423.90s -> 13425.90s]  And I'm sure you guys have died to it too
[13427.26s -> 13431.46s]  Because it's like a thing where like you never see you barely you don't see Ezreal that often, right?
[13431.58s -> 13434.66s]  So because you probably don't see Ezreal too often you're always like oh
[13437.01s -> 13445.64s]  Interesting type shit. I'm gonna grab this plate, and then I'm gonna back up
[13447.52s -> 13449.98s]  Cosics is coming down here, so I'm gonna back the fuck up
[13451.28s -> 13453.28s]  So I don't have arrow for 20
[13454.00s -> 13456.08s]  Ezreal has triforce. We need to back up a bit
[13459.44s -> 13461.44s]  We might have to give dragon
[13461.48s -> 13474.46s]  I could see giving dragon being okay, though. It's not that bad. Yeah, it's not it's not the worst to give Drake here. I
[13474.46s -> 13477.46s]  I can even back so we don't get dove
[13479.26s -> 13487.54s]  Like if we back now we might lose bot turret, but I can't walk up. Yeah, that's what I didn't want to have happen
[13488.42s -> 13492.39s]  See that's
[13492.39s -> 13494.39s]  I'm telling you bad rats
[13495.35s -> 13500.51s]  Absolute rats
[13500.51s -> 13504.55s]  Cosics players are rats man. Absolute literal rats. Oh
[13514.20s -> 13524.90s]  That's classy. That's a good dodge. I can't even walk up bot
[13524.90s -> 13528.46s]  I can wait for the turret, but I can't walk up
[13529.82s -> 13531.82s]  I'll just die
[13531.98s -> 13537.26s]  That's another thing you have to just accept like I'm down 40 CS this game because we've just been getting
[13537.86s -> 13539.86s]  We excited and we've also been getting
[13541.78s -> 13543.78s]  Like a moomoo is not very good I
[13545.02s -> 13548.18s]  Don't I don't have a better way to say it. I don't have like a nice way to say it
[13548.18s -> 13550.18s]  He's not having a good game
[13551.14s -> 13553.94s]  And when your support doesn't have a good game, you don't have a good game early
[13554.90s -> 13559.14s]  so the best thing you can do is just try and farm up what you can
[13559.14s -> 13565.73s]  don't die and scale for late it's all you can really do
[13565.73s -> 13571.81s]  as an AD carry when your support sucks it feels really bad but
[13571.81s -> 13583.03s]  sometimes you just got to accept it right this Ezreal's
[13583.03s -> 13587.11s]  not bad but he's not good either oh yeah this guy's gonna try and hold me
[13587.11s -> 13607.49s]  I'm an ult kill ran chair nice I don't have ult up yet guys
[13607.49s -> 13609.49s]  I don't have ult up yet. I can't ulti
[13610.61s -> 13612.93s]  I have ult now, but we need to bait them in a bit
[13615.72s -> 13617.88s]  I don't even want to use my ult right now to be honest with you
[13619.16s -> 13621.16s]  Like I really don't
[13622.12s -> 13625.96s]  You know what's funny that xerath is actually pretty good. I've played against him a few times in the past few seasons
[13626.76s -> 13629.56s]  He's actually not bad. He used to be in a support main
[13631.08s -> 13635.41s]  Like he played xerath support
[13635.49s -> 13637.49s]  That's why I recognized his name
[13643.43s -> 13645.27s]  We should not
[13645.27s -> 13652.55s]  go for this refs. I'm on a bad timer for this because I'm really low HP and mana.
[13659.19s -> 13673.04s]  Ooh, I don't have mana to arrow here guys. I do not want to arrow that because the
[13673.04s -> 13683.12s]  the fiora can totally, the fiora can do whatever it's called and the fiora can uh
[13683.12s -> 13687.20s]  what's it whatever it's called uh w it if she's fast enough and I didn't want to get my team
[13687.20s -> 13692.56s]  killed. The real issue here is that we're forcing. Okay I'll tell you exactly what the
[13692.56s -> 13699.88s]  real issue is we're forcing too many fights for no reason right now so like we're all forcing tons
[13699.88s -> 13705.08s]  of fights at the moment right but there's no reason for us to force these fights that's that's
[13705.08s -> 13711.56s]  why my team's getting tilted right like for some reason the amumu and the tf are both just like
[13711.56s -> 13715.72s]  inting and they're both getting frustrated but we actually win the game if we play it slow
[13717.48s -> 13720.44s]  like we can we can slow play this game out in scale but it just takes time
[13720.44s -> 13730.86s]  because I specifically picked Ash so that we could we had an answer for Zara
[13731.66s -> 13736.26s]  Because we have TF and Ash right so we have we have a really good answer for him. The problem is
[13738.10s -> 13740.10s]  We need to like stop tilting and just like
[13740.70s -> 13745.26s]  Understand that we can deal with him later. He's not like a he's not like an a soul right like a soul
[13745.26s -> 13747.62s]  It's one of those champs that like you can't deal with
[13748.50s -> 13753.54s]  Why did my Moo Moo wait to use ulti?
[13754.74s -> 13756.74s]  What?
[13756.78s -> 13758.78s]  He was in range
[13758.82s -> 13761.48s]  I know he was. Oh
[13769.10s -> 13773.14s]  Nice, okay, we got a kill. We need TF to play the game too though
[13774.54s -> 13777.30s]  Our TF is really tilted so he's just sitting bot
[13780.84s -> 13782.84s]  Amumu is extra tilted too, but I mean
[13783.36s -> 13786.76s]  I'll be I'll be honest the Amumu is playing worse than TF. It's just that he's
[13787.20s -> 13789.20s]  Dude, I hate when stuff happens like this
[13789.52s -> 13794.12s]  Stop stop pinging the guy man. He's already frustrated. You pinging him is not gonna make him less frustrated
[13795.36s -> 13797.36s]  You're just gonna piss him off more
[13798.52s -> 13804.66s]  Like just play it dude. We have a really good team comp
[13805.86s -> 13808.18s]  Like we're behind right now, but we have a good team comp
[13814.26s -> 13819.90s]  We should give this dragon by the way. They got thousand percent. We don't have tp
[13820.86s -> 13824.90s]  Like maybe maybe we could fight this but the morgues here so she can special my arrow
[13825.10s -> 13832.26s]  They got rift like we should give the drink. We also have no vision control of this area
[13833.46s -> 13838.10s]  So this is another thing of like why you guys wonder like why I play support in this hero
[13838.66s -> 13842.14s]  Like I get asked a lot like why are you a support man now? I'm still an 80 man
[13842.14s -> 13846.42s]  But the thing is it's really hard to play the game when your supports
[13846.98s -> 13848.98s]  Don't word correctly
[13849.90s -> 13854.10s]  We can give this guys we can give it's not a huge deal and ours top. We don't have to fight this
[13854.98s -> 13856.98s]  Guys, we don't have to fight this
[13857.14s -> 13866.16s]  It's back up. Yeah, like this isn't a fight. It's only second dragon. It's nothing
[13867.40s -> 13869.24s]  Wow, I suck at CSM
[13869.24s -> 13883.88s]  But you see how little vision control we have on the map right now. We have one ward here and that's about it
[13885.12s -> 13888.36s]  Vision control is I say it's 90% of the game in solo queue
[13888.76s -> 13892.40s]  That's why I like I feel like supports are like the unsung hero like when you get a support
[13892.40s -> 13903.70s]  Who knows how to properly throw out vision control? It feels insane. We just got a push. I
[13904.70s -> 13908.10s]  Do have Hawkshot and in a second we can see if they're on this
[13909.38s -> 13911.38s]  Okay, they're not I
[13911.38s -> 13927.91s]  I can volley, we can back up, Kha'zix is above me right now, okay Kha'zix wasted his ults, that's not bad, we should back.
[13927.91s -> 13932.91s]  I don't want to take this fight, TF could ulti but he's not, right?
[13932.91s -> 13939.91s]  Like this is one of those moments where I actually think we actually could have killed two of them right there, yeah TF ulted.
[13939.91s -> 13950.40s]  Because they were out of position really hard, but again, it's not like I think they're gonna walk
[13950.40s -> 13952.40s]  I think causes us
[13953.08s -> 13955.08s]  Yeah, he's he's somewhere up here. I don't know where he is
[13955.92s -> 13960.04s]  And I can't I think I can't hawk shot. I wasted my hawk shot for this dragon or this Baron
[13962.10s -> 13964.10s]  They could be on Baron
[13964.40s -> 13966.40s]  We need to check but I have no hawk shots
[13966.90s -> 13970.62s]  Okay, they're not they're not we're chilling good. Good. I need a hundred golds
[13983.74s -> 13986.98s]  Yeah, I'm aware. I'm getting ganked. I'm fully fucking aware. Trust me
[13987.12s -> 14018.52s]  I'm just trying to force them to make a choice probably wasn't a great use of my ghost, but I say we bail
[14018.52s -> 14021.92s]  I need to go get my item
[14021.92s -> 14024.88s]  Israel's just pushing aside somehow uncontested over there
[14032.35s -> 14034.43s]  Somebody just TP'd bot what?
[14037.73s -> 14039.73s]  What the fuck is this a moomoo doing?
[14040.41s -> 14042.41s]  What is my team doing? What are you guys doing?
[14043.01s -> 14054.56s]  This is so awkward man. I mean guys
[14055.64s -> 14059.64s]  Guys kill kill the Causics. Oh, thank God. I
[14059.64s -> 14064.70s]  I don't know why Kha'zix just dove to kill me of all people
[14065.80s -> 14069.66s]  My man just like wanted me dead. He was like, yeah fuck that 80 carry guy
[14070.72s -> 14072.72s]  like, okay
[14073.08s -> 14075.08s]  Sure
[14075.44s -> 14076.60s]  Fuck me
[14076.60s -> 14084.11s]  What do I want? I feel like I need damage, but I don't know what gives me the highest damage here
[14084.95s -> 14093.40s]  Maybe just I don't know. Maybe just PD
[14094.40s -> 14103.58s]  I'm not actually sure I you would be good, but it doesn't give me like more it gives me like eyes interesting in this position
[14105.46s -> 14107.96s]  Like I almost want more movement speed from the like PD
[14109.06s -> 14113.78s]  Even though normally like the utilities better like maybe BT is still the best and I'm just trolling
[14114.22s -> 14126.04s]  We can just do dragon right now. They have no TP here Baron. I think we totally actually could do this
[14126.04s -> 14134.22s]  I'm down to try if you if you want to Rengar. They got two people bought they're setting up for dragon vision right now
[14134.74s -> 14137.86s]  I'm actually kind of down to just try and play for Baron here
[14144.77s -> 14149.37s]  Like we could bait Baron here and force them to walk into us with my arrow I
[14177.28s -> 14179.80s]  Want to stay together because I don't know where the Cossacks is
[14182.49s -> 14198.94s]  Found him. What is my mumu doing dude? He has smite like I pull it out if you're gonna do this, right like
[14199.86s -> 14201.54s]  Like use your brain man
[14201.54s -> 14220.48s]  All right now we do Baron though. We have to we have to do Baron
[14220.92s -> 14228.82s]  This is like one of the worst players I've ever seen this a movie. He has no clue what he's doing by the way
[14229.90s -> 14236.01s]  Like he's so dumb
[14236.01s -> 14238.97s]  He's he's like flaming the TF. He's in his mind
[14238.97s -> 14242.45s]  He's so angry at this TF that he's ignoring every single thing that's going on
[14243.13s -> 14246.13s]  Like he's ignoring that like the dragon was a bad call to begin with
[14246.13s -> 14252.17s]  And if we are gonna do that dragon we have to zone the fucking jungler because he has fucking it
[14253.17s -> 14255.17s]  Smite right so it's like
[14256.29s -> 14258.29s]  Like what are you talking about it?
[14258.41s -> 14264.25s]  These players are crazy. It just feels to me like they're so angry at everything. It's kind of funny
[14266.32s -> 14271.00s]  Okay, I got three items now. I went for the PD because I kind of think the extra movement speed and the extra
[14272.00s -> 14277.77s]  It'll help a lot. I will say both the junglers are playing really well
[14277.77s -> 14284.57s]  this game is like interesting like both the assassin junglers are playing pretty
[14284.57s -> 14297.30s]  well the enemy Zeris playing pretty decent what that is not a I I mean that
[14297.30s -> 14302.70s]  was embarrassing like I don't even have words for that I genuinely don't have
[14302.70s -> 14321.41s]  words for that shit I missed I can't see we have no vision man like we have
[14321.41s -> 14330.49s]  no vision! Nothing's warded because the Mumu didn't put any wards down! So I can't fight
[14330.49s -> 14339.94s]  because literally we're standing there in this area and there's nothing warded. The best
[14339.94s -> 14344.74s]  part is all Mumu had to do was not die before that fight and we auto win. Like we were
[14344.74s -> 14349.62s]  winning so hard. But this Mumu is actually solo losing us the game with his fucking
[14349.62s -> 14361.17s]  ego god support players are so bad at league actually and they'll deflect support players
[14361.17s -> 14365.33s]  will will lie to themselves about how good they are and tell them that it's always their
[14365.33s -> 14372.09s]  team's fault but they'll drop nine deaths have 9kp in a fucking 23 kill game and then
[14372.09s -> 14396.64s]  blame their fucking team it's crazy please ward things man oh my god he's
[14396.64s -> 14415.91s]  dead again guys why are we up here top why are we top guys why are we three
[14415.91s -> 14424.69s]  manning top right now holy crap my teammates are absolute apes like what am
[14424.69s -> 14438.96s]  watching men they just three man's top oh my god like these are the worst
[14438.96s -> 14444.88s]  players I've ever fucking seen like we had the game in our hands and then all
[14444.88s -> 14448.76s]  of a sudden my team's like you know what I don't actually want to win and I'm
[14448.76s -> 14454.64s]  like why and they're like well you see I have an ego and you're like oh I see
[14454.64s -> 14459.88s]  this is why I can't play ad carry and see low I'm sorry I can't I have to
[14459.88s -> 14465.82s]  play support in this elo because adc is actually not playable when the entire
[14465.82s -> 14472.66s]  game is decided by jungle support and mid adc just does not decide any of the
[14472.66s -> 14477.36s]  league of legends games below grandmaster not one of them like last game we
[14477.36s -> 14481.42s]  popped off and we won because we were the better adc right this game it
[14481.42s -> 14486.50s]  doesn't matter because tf does 11k damage doesn't ulti bot more than
[14486.50s -> 14495.52s]  one time, like Rengar did well, Gnar did well, but they also had a horrible macro.
[14495.52s -> 14500.64s]  It is insane to me how easy support is as a role and at just how dog shit every support
[14500.64s -> 14503.14s]  player is on the server.
[14503.14s -> 14506.16s]  Your role requires zero thought.
[14506.16s -> 14512.12s]  Your thought when playing support is do I get vision or not?
[14512.12s -> 14515.76s]  If no, where can I be the most useful?
[14515.76s -> 14522.97s]  Your thought should never be, this game's over, my team sucks.
[14522.97s -> 14524.47s]  It drives me ludicrous.
[14524.47s -> 14531.85s]  Like, I'm sorry that I have to play support on this account to climb, but it's crazy
[14531.85s -> 14535.85s]  how dogshit adc is when you're solo queuing in Masters.
[14535.85s -> 14540.33s]  Like in GM, if it's a full GM game, adc is easy as fuck.
[14540.33s -> 14544.81s]  Like if everybody has a brain activity and they're not idiots, adc is amazing.
[14544.81s -> 14545.89s]  Favorite role in the game.
[14545.89s -> 14548.65s]  When you're playing with people who don't know what they're doing and you're
[14548.65s -> 14554.05s]  actively trying to climb and improve it genuinely feels like I'm pulling out a ball hair with
[14554.05s -> 14564.41s]  my tweezer or pulling out my ball hairs with tweezers like one by one it is so painful
[14564.41s -> 14574.08s]  it's crazy like let's take a look at this this support main right now 97 LP negative
[14574.08s -> 14580.96s]  win rate right I could I could literally tell that he was not a good player in the
[14580.96s -> 14589.61s]  the first 30 seconds of that game. I'm sorry I'm being mean, but this has been driving
[14589.61s -> 14599.46s]  me crazy. Look at the support I had last game. Also, can I ask you a question? Why am
[14599.46s -> 14607.94s]  I even allowed? Why am I even allowed to be in games with a challenger support one game?
[14607.94s -> 14621.06s]  I win the game, then immediately it puts me in a game with a 97 LP master support.
[14621.06s -> 14628.01s]  What is this matchmaking?
[14628.01s -> 14634.81s]  This is insane.
[14634.81s -> 14658.14s]  That's crazy.
[14658.14s -> 14665.35s]  I don't even, I'm wondering why.
[14665.35s -> 14667.43s]  So I'm going to go on a rant for a second.
[14667.43s -> 14669.31s]  Why is this allowed?
[14669.31s -> 14670.99s]  Why can you be in a game?
[14670.99s -> 14676.55s]  Why can I be in a game with a literal guy who's about to promote the challenger, right?
[14676.55s -> 14678.11s]  We win the game.
[14678.11s -> 14685.06s]  And then the very next game, it puts me in a game with a guy who's 97 LP.
[14685.06s -> 14686.06s]  This is insane.
[14686.06s -> 14702.55s]  Sorry, that's just frustrating as fuck
[14703.85s -> 14711.82s]  Because it's like such bad game design, right like that's that's 900 LP difference
[14711.82s -> 14720.88s]  And the thing is this guy doesn't have good MMR
[14722.08s -> 14724.88s]  Right like it's not it's not like this guy has good MMR
[14726.04s -> 14727.56s]  right
[14727.56s -> 14729.28s]  Because look at his games
[14729.28s -> 14735.58s]  He's playing with all masters players. They're all like 100 LP masters 70 LP 30 LP, right?
[14735.58s -> 14741.76s]  it. It doesn't make sense. It's not like his MMR is high. So why is this guy getting
[14741.76s -> 14748.96s]  into like a 600 LP grandmaster game? Why are we putting that guy in the game? That's so
[14748.96s -> 14758.36s]  frustrating. Sorry, I just, I needed events. How do you know which AD carry to pick in
[14758.36s -> 14766.88s]  each situation? Uh, it's a lot of knowledge. A lot of knowledge. Like you have to know
[14766.88s -> 14772.88s]  a lot of shit. Like what the enemy champions do, what your champions need to do to win the game,
[14772.88s -> 14778.80s]  what the win cons are. You can just pick, and I'm being honest though, you could just pick a,
[14781.44s -> 14784.64s]  like there are 80 carries in the current meta where you can just pick that are blind.
[14784.64s -> 14788.80s]  Like I was making a tier list, I forgot about it. But I mean you can blind pick Jynx pretty
[14788.80s -> 14794.48s]  much every game. Like Jynx is just blindable every game pretty much, she's insane. She's
[14794.48s -> 14799.28s]  super OP. So like if you if you ever just want to play a champion and you think like okay I want to
[14799.28s -> 14808.51s]  practice AD, like Jinx is insane. Super good. Draven's not blindable but I do think he's really good
[14808.51s -> 14814.99s]  if you're good at the game. Draven's very good. He's harder than Jinx by a mile like Draven's
[14814.99s -> 14822.12s]  a lot harder but he's definitely like good at carrying with a lead as well. Like another
[14822.12s -> 14826.84s]  blindable AD that I think is like A tier is like Varus. You can blind pick Varus really easily
[14826.84s -> 14832.22s]  because Varus doesn't really have counters like he doesn't get countered by
[14832.22s -> 14837.94s]  anything he's more of like a you can pick him and then go even and your ulti will
[14837.94s -> 14842.38s]  always be useful you can look to like when lane you can look to like engage
[14842.38s -> 14872.03s]  things like that right okay so this game as the support I need to be
[14872.03s -> 14878.41s]  tracking the jungler so I'm gonna think where always be thinking what the
[14878.41s -> 14881.49s]  enemy jungler wants to accomplish and how to stop it that's like a pretty
[14881.49s -> 14886.59s]  big tip of advice I can give you guys like think to yourself like okay if I
[14886.59s -> 14889.17s]  was the enemy jungler what would I be wanting to do against this Graves right
[14889.17s -> 14894.25s]  as Lee Sin he's probably gonna want to either gank early like gank bot early or
[14894.25s -> 14900.49s]  he wants to invade on certain timers right because that's like what Lee is
[14900.49s -> 14907.35s]  really good at is ganking and invading so what I think I'm gonna try to do
[14907.35s -> 14913.27s]  this game is I'm going to try and watch for early ganks and early pressure bot lanes like
[14913.27s -> 14918.83s]  level 2, level 3 ganks. We're still going to be aggressive, but Lux took TP, which means
[14918.83s -> 14923.91s]  this Lux does not plan on playing aggressive at all. Like she basically, if anybody takes
[14923.91s -> 14928.91s]  TP like this in a lane, I already know from start of the game that they're not planning
[14928.91s -> 14933.07s]  on doing anything. So I'm probably going to end up roaming a lot this game. This
[14933.07s -> 14949.14s]  This is going to be a game where I roam a ton.
[14949.14s -> 14951.10s]  We do have some good lanes to roam to too.
[14951.10s -> 14964.92s]  Roaming top and mid is both really good.
[14964.92s -> 14971.90s]  I just want her to ward early because I don't want to get shit on badly.
[14971.90s -> 14976.46s]  So okay, I'm just going to flash immediately.
[14976.46s -> 14981.10s]  There's no reason to not flash there because Alistar used his flash to get my flash, which
[14981.10s -> 14982.54s]  is totally fine.
[14982.54s -> 14991.68s]  It's better for him because he has hex flash, but it's not that bad because I
[14991.68s -> 14999.20s]  outrange him and I can stay away from his his shit so we know he's in the bush we just chill
[15000.32s -> 15006.32s]  there it is he fucked up now we go forward I don't know why Lux isn't throwing spells at this guy
[15006.32s -> 15011.60s]  like like I don't know why she didn't cue him like he fucked up the Alistar should have died there
[15013.28s -> 15016.80s]  and she's pinging me okay the Alistar should have died there if Alistar ever
[15016.80s -> 15021.60s]  fucks up on a gauge like that where he hex flashes in gets stuck like cue his cooldown yeah I
[15021.60s -> 15023.78s]  I don't know why it was thrown is what I'm saying.
[15023.78s -> 15029.86s]  You don't throw spells that aren't going to land.
[15029.86s -> 15034.40s]  So there's no point in Lux ever throwing her Q until Alistar fucks up the combo.
[15034.40s -> 15039.06s]  Like she should just poke with E and then because it's almost like a Blitz hook, right?
[15039.06s -> 15040.62s]  Think of it like a Blitz hook.
[15040.62s -> 15043.62s]  If she throws the Q out, right?
[15043.62s -> 15049.14s]  Now they have an opportunity to be aggressive because they know the hook is down.
[15049.14s -> 15053.98s]  So it's better for her to just hold the hook, essentially, right?
[15053.98s -> 15054.98s]  Hold the Q.
[15054.98s -> 15060.34s]  And now, when Alistar does go in, they have to be nervous about that Q, because they can't
[15060.34s -> 15063.00s]  just think, oh, the Q's down, let's engage, right?
[15063.00s -> 15064.46s]  So they can't actually think about that.
[15064.46s -> 15077.39s]  This is why I don't like a lot of the time doing this, like push, push the wave.
[15077.39s -> 15085.35s]  They can't engage on us without like flashing, so it doesn't matter, like look.
[15085.35s -> 15090.41s]  Did she cue the wave again or am I an idiot?
[15090.41s -> 15091.41s]  Like just...
[15091.41s -> 15093.09s]  Oh man I'm losing my mind tier.
[15093.09s -> 15095.81s]  Oh these, I'm tilting.
[15095.81s -> 15096.81s]  It's fine.
[15096.81s -> 15100.57s]  I need to not tilt, I need to just chill but I'm getting frustrated because we're like
[15100.57s -> 15108.04s]  not using cooldowns properly and it's driving me fucking crazy.
[15108.04s -> 15110.00s]  Because these are very simple things to do.
[15110.00s -> 15111.60s]  You guys gotta walk the wave in by the way.
[15111.60s -> 15112.60s]  You can't let them freeze.
[15112.60s -> 15113.60s]  Okay.
[15113.60s -> 15114.60s]  They're very simple things to do.
[15114.60s -> 15117.76s]  I know I'm being annoying as shit whining about this but this is stuff that you
[15117.76s -> 15121.60s]  need to be thinking about when you're playing the game. Well, you should actively be thinking,
[15124.16s -> 15130.24s]  what can I do with my champion's toolkit to stop their champion's toolkit? And you should be thinking,
[15130.24s -> 15136.48s]  okay, I have Q, right? So what do they want to do? They want to go in. Okay. And when you're
[15136.48s -> 15144.10s]  thinking, they want to go in, right? You should be thinking, okay, when they go in, I can just
[15144.10s -> 15149.34s]  Q and that should be your entire thought process your thought process should never be oh
[15150.84s -> 15158.76s]  Maybe I can land a random Q at max range and we can get a kill she cued the wave. Yes. That's what I mean like
[15159.60s -> 15163.56s]  You should never queue the wave on Lux either unless you're going to 100% reset
[15163.96s -> 15171.48s]  That would be like if I hooked the wave as like let's crank or some shit. Why is my Lux bait pinging my graves?
[15172.16s -> 15175.68s]  Dude, I got to keep this a hundred percent honest to the men
[15177.68s -> 15180.96s]  You don't get you you don't get to be mad here
[15182.08s -> 15184.08s]  Why are dude these players are such babies
[15187.66s -> 15190.86s]  Jesus christ what pussies man these people are such babies
[15193.81s -> 15196.05s]  The graves played correctly by the way like a hundred percent
[15197.49s -> 15199.49s]  That he's mad at the graves for taking a wave
[15199.97s -> 15202.93s]  He wanted to not like he wanted to be able to TP back and get the wave
[15203.41s -> 15208.05s]  That's what this locks is so trash that she actually believes that's the graves faults
[15208.53s -> 15211.09s]  That graves misplayed by pushing the bot wave
[15211.09s -> 15216.01s]  but it was the right play pushing the bot wave was the correct play there
[15216.01s -> 15219.91s]  because then she doesn't have to TP the whole reason that he's pushing it is to
[15219.91s -> 15228.64s]  save her teleport so that she doesn't have to TP to lane players like this are
[15228.64s -> 15232.44s]  why the game is hard to play right now in the current meta why it feels bad
[15232.44s -> 15236.68s]  because this Lux is trash everybody you guys can all see this Lux is terrible
[15236.68s -> 15240.12s]  she's already made a bunch of mistakes she's blaming her team she's being a
[15240.12s -> 15250.29s]  dip shit right but she can climb up to this elo being this bad because of the
[15250.29s -> 15270.43s]  system the current system in place we should immediately do Baron here dragon
[15270.43s -> 15279.17s]  I mean we should do this come you don't have time for this just come do dragon
[15279.17s -> 15297.90s]  bro the leeson just showed top we should be doing dragon when when this
[15297.90s -> 15302.46s]  shit happens by the way where you have enemy jungler shows on one side
[15302.46s -> 15309.26s]  map you should always be playing on the other side of the map to make a counter play so jungler
[15309.26s -> 15320.10s]  shows on top side we go for dragon right easy yo be careful alistar is going to be there xerath's
[15320.10s -> 15326.31s]  going to be there just leave just leave leave leave leave i'll do it for you i'll i'll make
[15326.31s -> 15334.10s]  you leave i got you man but we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and um i
[15334.10s -> 15338.18s]  need the back now but we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and not only
[15338.18s -> 15348.46s]  Not only did their bot lane have to back, but the enemy was top.
[15348.46s -> 15349.46s]  I tried, man.
[15349.46s -> 15357.90s]  I tried to flash, Q him, but yeah, it's really, I don't know, a lot of junglers don't, I don't
[15357.90s -> 15360.54s]  think they know what they're, oh I'm dead by the way.
[15360.54s -> 15364.18s]  I'm not even gonna pop exhaust, I'm just dead.
[15364.18s -> 15368.50s]  A lot of junglers don't know what the goal of the game actually is.
[15368.50s -> 15372.30s]  A lot of them think that was a bad insect, but a lot of junglers think the goal of
[15372.30s -> 15376.30s]  the game is to like get as much farm as you can and run over the enemy team and shit,
[15376.30s -> 15380.96s]  but it's actually, it is, but it's also about like getting early objectives and turning
[15380.96s -> 15386.84s]  those small leads and the big leads through objective control, right?
[15386.84s -> 15390.74s]  So like right now, I want to rotate top, Rift is up, I know Lee Sin is going to be
[15390.74s -> 15395.46s]  on top side of the map right now, I want to rotate top so that I can help my team
[15395.46s -> 15398.94s]  by being in the top side of the map because that's where the next play is going to
[15398.94s -> 15403.68s]  be made.
[15403.68s -> 15406.24s]  Well, the play's made mid, but I mean, I'm here, so it's fine.
[15413.36s -> 15414.48s]  Oh my god.
[15418.50s -> 15421.06s]  I did not think the fucking...
[15421.30s -> 15422.82s]  Lee Sin would be there, too.
[15424.26s -> 15425.22s]  Oh, oops.
[15429.18s -> 15431.66s]  This is rough. I don't really know how to...
[15432.06s -> 15435.34s]  how to play this, because I got there in time to counter the gank.
[15435.98s -> 15436.62s]  Right?
[15437.18s -> 15439.18s]  I exhausted the guy, saved the Zareth.
[15439.74s -> 15441.50s]  I got there in time to counter the gank, but...
[15444.00s -> 15445.68s]  Ooh, well played.
[15445.68s -> 15449.22s]  That was actually mega well played
[15450.88s -> 15456.21s]  That was really good, I want to push this way then but I can't
[15465.02s -> 15470.82s]  Like you guys are noticing there's no objectives taken on the map yet at ten minutes, which is kind of crazy
[15471.46s -> 15475.34s]  The alley's doing really good. The house is not a bad support player. He's playing well
[15475.86s -> 15497.70s]  Like he's playing very well a lot of this is more of like I need I don't have anything to do on the map because
[15497.70s -> 15501.66s]  I'm trying to help my jungler, but my jungler is trolling
[15502.58s -> 15504.58s]  It's really rough
[15504.90s -> 15510.38s]  Cuz like I'm trying to rotate over and help my jungler on cooldown basically right, but my jungler doesn't want to fight
[15510.70s -> 15514.14s]  You see like I'm countering the Alistar's fight their ganks. It's just
[15514.74s -> 15524.26s]  I'm just dead
[15524.26s -> 15526.26s]  dude
[15527.02s -> 15533.34s]  Like we shouldn't have made that play mid because we knew that they were all there and we knew that our jungler is doing this
[15533.34s -> 15540.38s]  this might just be a jungle diff honestly like our adc sucks but it might
[15540.38s -> 15545.46s]  just be a straight-up jungle diff game they do happen especially in this
[15545.46s -> 15553.84s]  elo where jungle has so much control of the game they do happen it's a pretty
[15553.84s -> 15558.64s]  big jungle diff chip hoppy you know it I know it like yeah he's saying yeah
[15558.64s -> 15566.21s]  like he knows the jungle is getting out outclassed insanely hard because
[15566.21s -> 15572.67s]  Graves counters Lee Sin. It's a massive counter. But this guy doesn't know what
[15572.67s -> 15579.15s]  he's doing. I think he's a Rengar one-trick and Rengar got banned. I think
[15579.15s -> 15584.25s]  that's what's going on. It's a Rengar one-trick who got banned out and he tried
[15584.25s -> 15589.59s]  to play a champion that requires thought. Not just a I jump you die champ, right?
[15589.59s -> 15598.68s]  And he just gets shit on for it. I mean dude I can't even I can't even do
[15598.68s -> 15603.42s]  anything this game. Our top laner is getting his ass whipped too. It's really
[15603.42s -> 15612.41s]  fucking rough I mean he's in here I'm pretty sure it's not it was just it was
[15612.41s -> 15618.49s]  warded though I mean we can't really do anything here I'm I'm dead I think yeah
[15618.49s -> 15623.81s]  I'm just dead this is just rough I I kind of want to go next because I don't
[15623.81s -> 15630.21s]  think I don't think we have the skill on the team to win the jungle depth is
[15630.21s -> 15648.44s]  huge the 80 diff is huge and I'm just I can't I can't impact the map like
[15648.44s -> 15651.56s]  I can't I just can't do anything this game to impact the map and it feels really bad. Oh
[15662.65s -> 15664.65s]  Son of a bitch. I should have flashed I
[15667.68s -> 15671.20s]  Got like creep walked a little bit when he knocked me in I like had to walk through it should just flashed up
[15671.20s -> 15673.90s]  That's my man. Like what was that TP man? Oh
[15674.36s -> 15679.48s]  God get me out. I'm gonna be a hundred percent real get me out that TP was miserably bad
[15680.20s -> 15682.20s]  Dude just TP'd to the wave
[15690.70s -> 15692.70s]  Like what is our blocks doing to like I?
[15693.86s -> 15695.94s]  Just feel like everybody's late to the fights
[15695.94s -> 15702.66s]  Lux is always late to the fights. The Graves doesn't want to take fights even though he's
[15702.66s -> 15709.22s]  playing Graves in the Lee Sin. Like I feel like, ooh this is a rough game. Games like
[15709.22s -> 15713.70s]  this tilt me and I kind of just want to go next. Cause games like this, they are winnable
[15713.70s -> 15717.98s]  but I feel like I want to go next to save mental, you know? Like low key, I just
[15717.98s -> 15734.10s]  want to save my mental. Cause ugh, it's so gross. Like watching what Lux did in
[15734.10s -> 15738.74s]  early stages of the lane phase just wasting her Q on repeat that was one of the most embarrassing
[15738.74s -> 15759.75s]  things ever and then like look at that she just Q'd a minion. Bro like oh my god you gotta push the
[15759.75s -> 15780.32s]  wave man holy shits I mean I can't I can't even walk oh my god I don't even have help from my
[15780.32s -> 15790.48s]  fucking team that's the worst part about this dude these games feel so
[15790.48s -> 15796.04s]  unplayable man like I don't know how else to say it except for they just feel
[15796.04s -> 15803.88s]  miserable to play I'm trying to focus on playing like improving myself but it's
[15803.88s -> 15811.00s]  so hard to know how to improve in games where like you genuinely just get no
[15811.00s -> 15821.45s]  help. My Lux has been tilted since like minute two for some reason, and my Graves has been
[15821.45s -> 15826.55s]  completely pathing wrong, doing wrong shit. It's hard to know how to help, like I went
[15826.55s -> 15834.34s]  mid to help, countered two of the early ganks. Lux still griefed the game. So like yeah it's
[15834.34s -> 15846.85s]  just it's hard to know, and then top lane lost. It's so rough man. Like I'm gonna
[15846.85s -> 15851.25s]  keep it 100% honest with you. If you are a one trick, do not try and play other
[15851.25s -> 15863.12s]  champs. You will int. You will play badly always and you will int. And you will, you will
[15863.12s -> 15873.88s]  complete, like, look at this. This is 2.9k damage. As a dude, like, what are we doing?
[15873.88s -> 15880.60s]  How are these people getting into this elo? How does this locks like in the game? She
[15880.60s -> 15889.72s]  was against an Alistar bot and she did 1.2.9k damage in a 16 minute game against a melee
[15889.72s -> 15901.95s]  heavy team like what is this what is happening this guy was d4 30 LP last season and now he's
[15901.95s -> 15917.88s]  magically in masters no we need to fix matchmaking this is this is insane like this is just a
[15917.88s -> 15925.16s]  matchmaking diff it's nothing else my man literally does not belong in master tier 400
[15925.16s -> 15946.32s]  MMR at all why you can see that he's not at this level dude. I have the Lux player on my team again. Oh
[15949.73s -> 15962.85s]  There's a Zerath one trick and a Rengar one trick on the enemy team. I don't know man. I
[15963.61s -> 15984.73s]  Guess I care more about the Rengar than the Zerath, but this is rough. Oh, what's up? Tripopi dude?
[15984.73s -> 15988.13s]  Sorry, I hit yes on that man. I know the game was winnable. I'm gonna be real
[15988.13s -> 15993.59s]  But dude you didn't see what I saw during the early game of that game chupabi like man
[15994.17s -> 15998.72s]  The entire early game of that game was like
[15999.32s -> 16001.40s]  We lost lane
[16001.40s -> 16007.74s]  Because Lux wouldn't use her Q to fight the Alistar. She was using it to farm minions
[16009.00s -> 16016.60s]  Like she was so scared of being engaged on by the Alistar and the Calista that she would use her Q to max range farm minions
[16016.60s -> 16020.84s]  Instead of save it so when the Alistar engages we just kill him
[16022.36s -> 16025.78s]  Right because if Alistar ever engages on me in Lux, he just gets killed
[16026.12s -> 16031.18s]  We just bind him walk away, and he's stuck there and he dies right but for some reason
[16031.68s -> 16036.48s]  She didn't understand how to do that. So she was just throwing it to farm
[16036.48s -> 16042.14s]  So we would just get engaged on so I started roaming and every time I was like roaming to an objective or something
[16042.18s -> 16047.42s]  The graves would always walk away and not fight like he wasn't attempting to fight
[16047.42s -> 16049.62s]  He was basically just like oh, I'm gonna go farm some more
[16049.70s -> 16053.54s]  But I'm like dude you can't do that like if the Alistar is ganking mid and I'm countering mid
[16053.54s -> 16057.88s]  You can't just farm farm before coming mid or you can't just like not take dragon and shit like that
[16057.88s -> 16064.22s]  Right like it blows my mind that these players can get like it's like this guy too same thing like that jungler last game, right?
[16064.74s -> 16068.66s]  Look at this. It's the same thing as the last game like NA is riddled with this shit
[16068.66s -> 16074.34s]  It's so miserable to play look at this this jungler last game, right? He's not he's what like a d1 player
[16074.34s -> 16078.82s]  right? He's not a bad player. He peeps D1. But why is this guy in this game now? He like
[16078.82s -> 16083.50s]  artificially inflated to the silo, getting lucky with his first few games, and now we
[16083.50s -> 16091.65s]  have to play with this guy. Oh, it's an account share. The person- it's a different player.
[16091.65s -> 16103.61s]  Look. On the account. D flash, F flash. So, uh, it's a fucking account share. That's-
[16103.61s -> 16114.80s]  that's frustrating. Sorry for whining so much, guys. This shit's just really frustrating
[16114.80s -> 16121.16s]  to me like I know I should play to like specifically only care about like improving and then while
[16121.16s -> 16125.12s]  you're improving you'll climb automatically and shit but it's really frustrating when
[16125.12s -> 16131.04s]  like the players in the game would rather be idiots and assholes to each other than play
[16131.04s -> 16135.24s]  the game right like the game before the amumu right the game before this the amumu was
[16135.24s -> 16139.52s]  just being toxic the whole game and into the win away the last game the locks and
[16139.52s -> 16143.92s]  the graves were being toxic to each other the whole game we into the game away
[16143.92s -> 16151.60s]  It's like, I, it's, it's not fun to lose because one player gets mad at another player over them both being idiots.
[16154.53s -> 16157.17s]  I'm sorry, it's not fun. It's so unfun.
[16158.61s -> 16161.09s]  But we'll try and, we'll try and win this one.
[16172.98s -> 16175.62s]  All we can really do is try and carry the games, right?
[16177.30s -> 16177.86s]  It's about it.
[16178.98s -> 16180.10s]  What is?
[16189.28s -> 16189.78s]  What?
[16192.04s -> 16194.84s]  What, man? What, what do you think they're gonna do to me?
[16194.84s -> 16198.52s]  Welcome to the league of yeah, thank you for the seven months man. Welcome back
[16199.04s -> 16202.04s]  I really don't want to meet all I don't I don't want to meet all
[16202.60s -> 16218.43s]  Because like I want to like value the pings and shit, but dude if they walk up. I'm gonna flank them
[16219.07s -> 16254.66s]  That's what I'm standing here. Okay there in a minute. Well, that was a big cue. I
[16255.18s -> 16257.18s]  Need to get level two first here a hundred percent
[16257.82s -> 16278.23s]  Ash should have just been autoing there that whole time
[16279.95s -> 16284.99s]  Because we have heel so she should have just walked up and autoed as soon as this is what I mean
[16285.03s -> 16289.85s]  by tracking cooldowns. As soon as the Niko missed her, as soon as the Niko missed her
[16289.85s -> 16295.29s]  cooldown, as soon as she missed her E, the Ashe just walked up and immediately started
[16295.29s -> 16302.93s]  fighting. Right? Like, because they can no longer kill us. The Niko doesn't actually have
[16302.93s -> 16308.13s]  spells outside of her E, right? So she misses that snare, and she used her W too, right?
[16308.13s -> 16314.53s]  So it's like, we just go ham. You don't need to be too scared. It happens quite
[16314.53s -> 16336.24s]  a bit sometimes where people will just be like really nervous damn if I had dodged
[16336.24s -> 16341.48s]  that cue I actually would have killed all three damn I don't know if it was worth
[16341.48s -> 16344.60s]  the flash after the guy I actually I think it was if I had dodged the cue I
[16344.60s -> 16349.48s]  would have been fine so that was that it's whatever I also doesn't miss any
[16349.48s -> 16357.69s]  creeps here so it's not the end of the world like I'm pretty sure Lee Sin
[16357.69s -> 16367.81s]  did not have his top camps by the way damn if I was a little better
[16367.81s -> 16375.92s]  mechanically I turned that by the way 100% we should push this wave so that I
[16375.92s -> 16403.88s]  can go get vision because yeah that guy can't freeze that wave so it's not too
[16403.88s -> 16433.41s]  bad we since top you can kind of see some really good what is this why is my
[16433.41s -> 16466.78s]  car this AFK turret what is happening right now why was he AFK I mean I guess
[16466.78s -> 16470.34s]  It worked out, but yeah, maybe you had to go let his cat out and I don't know
[16472.66s -> 16481.82s]  Happens we do their ball lanes not very good
[16483.02s -> 16485.30s]  They're trying too hard to force fights that they can't win
[16489.60s -> 16492.44s]  Like they they genuinely can't win half these fights that they're trying to force
[16493.76s -> 16497.00s]  Maybe if they were against people who like don't push their buttons they could win those
[16497.00s -> 16499.68s]  But it's like all I have to do is stand there and fight back and they lose
[16500.56s -> 16504.56s]  They're on dragon a thousand percent right now. There's not a lot I can do about that
[16504.56s -> 16512.20s]  We just have to chill there's almost nothing I can do about it. Kai says trying to fake act like she's big, but it's
[16515.75s -> 16517.75s]  There's just nothing we can do
[16519.24s -> 16529.19s]  Cuz our car this is top so we just chill they finish the cheer list. No, no, no not yet
[16530.51s -> 16533.91s]  Whoa
[16533.91s -> 16535.91s]  Lisa and could be bought right now
[16537.55s -> 16541.83s]  Mmm, I don't think it's too bad if he's bought though. They can't really dive us especially with card this old
[16556.98s -> 16559.10s]  Why why does my ash just run?
[16560.16s -> 16567.76s]  She like just straight up runs away. It's kind of silly
[16576.84s -> 16581.64s]  Cuz we have we have Carthus ulti like we can win that five or a we can win a fight bot right now
[16581.64s -> 16588.78s]  I guess I guess I'm just gonna have to get them low enough for Carthus to kill them
[16590.30s -> 16592.54s]  Like without the ashes help
[16593.66s -> 16595.66s]  Which I think I can do it's not too bad
[16596.22s -> 16599.53s]  Okay, the Akali's coming bot
[16600.41s -> 16602.41s]  We just killed him. I mean let's just fight
[16610.80s -> 16612.80s]  Don't know why we just ash arrow honestly
[16613.56s -> 16621.47s]  Just ash arrow
[16621.47s -> 16623.47s]  Okay, that was pretty bad ash arrow, but
[16630.56s -> 16633.64s]  Filled I don't think he's filled. I think he's just having a bad game
[16635.04s -> 16637.04s]  Like I think it happens, you know
[16637.60s -> 16642.52s]  Whoa, okay
[16642.52s -> 16644.68s]  Do it ult me. I fucking dare you
[16645.48s -> 16651.22s]  I'm trying to keep some mana
[16651.50s -> 16653.50s]  So that I can ulti
[16653.50s -> 16677.36s]  Oh, Karthus already used his ults. Fuck. They both backed there? Wow.
[16678.24s -> 16684.20s]  My bad. I honestly didn't think they were both gonna back there.
[16684.84s -> 16689.62s]  Like, I thought the Kaisa was gonna back right where I saw her like last.
[16690.66s -> 16692.50s]  That was my bad.
[16692.50s -> 16694.50s]  Mmm, I should be.
[16694.86s -> 16696.86s]  I think Lee Sin can come bot here and kill me.
[16699.84s -> 16701.84s]  I should actually stop this guy's back.
[16702.08s -> 16712.33s]  Yeah, I should stop his back because it's more value to stop the back now. Even if Lee Sin isn't bot, it's more value.
[16712.33s -> 16714.33s]  Because he's so low
[16716.41s -> 16718.97s]  Collie is Mia though, so we got to be care I
[16720.65s -> 16723.33s]  Wasted my ult though, which makes me kind of scared
[16723.81s -> 16726.91s]  The other thing that kind of sucks about this is we don't have good vision
[16727.41s -> 16737.43s]  And I can't really help anybody on the map because the same thing is happening as before
[16738.51s -> 16741.55s]  We're like we're missing opportunities to get kills on timers
[16741.55s -> 16746.84s]  I mean the dog lighting guy's playing fine this game
[16746.84s -> 16751.08s]  I think he's trolled a lot like he's he's trolling. This isn't like his best game
[16752.24s -> 16756.36s]  But it's also I don't know why we're getting so tilted around the map right now
[16757.04s -> 16759.96s]  Because if I'm if I'm being honest, we should just win the game off of like
[16761.52s -> 16781.19s]  Being better players. I don't know what this car. This is thinking but do it do it it
[16782.19s -> 16784.19s]  Part this we can fight we can fight just fight
[16787.08s -> 16789.08s]  Bro, what are we doing?
[16789.08s -> 16795.68s]  I'm losing it man. Ah, no, no, no. I'm tilted. I'm tilted as fuck. He didn't walk in
[16795.68s -> 16802.80s]  just go on to the Akali shroud man. I just walk a foot to your right and stand
[16802.80s -> 16807.68s]  on the Akali shroud. She just eats your damage like while she's in the shroud.
[16807.68s -> 16817.80s]  She can't stop that. Holy shit. I'm losing my minds. Like Ash is just
[16817.80s -> 16820.76s]  Inting bot waves right now not trying to do anything
[16822.20s -> 16826.72s]  Walks is really far up on CS, which is really good, but I'm losing it man
[16828.52s -> 16830.96s]  Like we see exactly where they are every game
[16831.36s -> 16837.04s]  Like we see where everybody is on the enemy team permanently, and we still can't manage to like walk to the right location
[16837.80s -> 16841.74s]  This is driving me crazy
[16841.74s -> 16843.74s]  my my car this
[16844.30s -> 16846.30s]  My car this jungles getting out farmed
[16846.86s -> 16849.50s]  Like a car this jungles getting out farmed by a Lee Sin jungle
[16849.82s -> 16851.66s]  That's insane
[16851.66s -> 16854.70s]  Like I don't think I don't think I can stress enough how crazy that is
[16855.30s -> 16860.48s]  Like there should never be a world where Carthus ever gets out farms
[16865.37s -> 16867.37s]  No way
[16867.41s -> 16874.57s]  I'm dead dude. No way. I just fucking ate the end of that now. I'm playing that just kill the Lee sin man
[16875.89s -> 16886.12s]  I fucked up there
[16886.96s -> 16890.80s]  That was my fault because I got hit by the tip of the that was my fault
[16890.80s -> 16894.42s]  I got barely clipped by the tip of the nico ults when I was trying to space cuz I'm bad
[16895.30s -> 16898.60s]  And if I was alive there, and I could have saved my flash for the Lee Sin Q
[16898.60s -> 16905.29s]  We just win I am confused that why we decided to like not fight that immediately though
[16906.37s -> 16909.73s]  Like we caught out two of their members and we just got scared for whatever reason
[16910.45s -> 16912.25s]  Wait, we win this fight
[16912.25s -> 16931.30s]  With thousand percent win this fight this fight this fight this bro. Do not throw a fucking temper tantrum right now
[16931.90s -> 16934.66s]  There's one kill. Do not throw a temper tantrum
[16938.43s -> 16952.20s]  my god here we go I took one kill the guys about to lose his mind guys I need to
[16952.20s -> 16958.00s]  mute all I'm gonna mute all in a second like I can't with these people right
[16958.00s -> 16967.20s]  now but I can't man you people are disgusting like you guys just whine
[16967.20s -> 16970.44s]  you play bad you whine and you bitch about every little mistake that
[16970.44s -> 16973.48s]  everything happens even though it's like in the middle of a fight I
[16973.48s -> 16976.92s]  guarantee I'm a better player than you are and you're still whining and
[16976.92s -> 16981.48s]  crying over one shutdown that like you didn't even walk to until I spam pinged you
[16981.48s -> 16989.75s]  like I literally 1v2ed them you hit one e and now you're mad dude I swear league
[16989.75s -> 16998.13s]  players are fucking psychopaths at least I got the exhaust off surely she dies
[16998.13s -> 17006.77s]  right surely she dies here or not okay okay at least she died help each other
[17006.77s -> 17020.09s]  guys help each other teamwork teamwork teamwork teamwork teamwork wait this
[17020.09s -> 17029.69s]  ash is insane okay I'm not gonna lie that ash played that so good I only saw
[17029.69s -> 17036.59s]  the end of it and she still played that good that was sick well well done that
[17036.59s -> 17048.16s]  was actually really good she almost stopped the dive that's crazy this game
[17048.16s -> 17054.84s]  is definitely 1000% still winnable though. We just have to play for late game and not
[17054.84s -> 17059.04s]  lose our fucking mines. I'll let that push back into my ash, I'll go mid and get some
[17059.04s -> 17072.20s]  vision. That's pretty much all we have to do. Play for late and not lose our mine early.
[17072.20s -> 17077.28s]  We could play to kill the sacali right now, she doesn't know, there's no ward here.
[17077.28s -> 17091.38s]  We could also invade here. Oh that's so unlucky. That was such a close queue.
[17091.38s -> 17122.81s]  kill that guy. Jesus Christ. I feel like we should have won that fight. I feel like something
[17122.81s -> 17128.65s]  awkward happened and we lost. Did my Ash just walk directly into this Akali and not use
[17128.65s -> 17146.17s]  her ulti? Use your ulti. You have ulti. Use your ulti. Oh my god. What the fuck? Oh
[17146.17s -> 17155.45s]  my god. I don't even know what to say right now. This is insane. This genuinely feels
[17155.45s -> 17158.77s]  like everybody in the game is losing their mind in the freest game I've ever
[17158.77s -> 17167.18s]  seen in my life like that's what we're losing to right there that guy the guy
[17167.18s -> 17172.62s]  who like doesn't understand how Senna works like that player that's why I'm
[17172.62s -> 17178.08s]  frustrated like that player right there has no idea how Senna works tries to
[17178.08s -> 17183.18s]  fight me and we're like losing to that guy like I'm trying really hard not
[17183.18s -> 17188.38s]  to be an asshole but like it's flooding out right now from these games it's
[17188.38s -> 17200.60s]  crazy but he's so toxic look at this he went proto belt I only a boot Niko but
[17200.60s -> 17220.06s]  like what that doesn't do anything to help his team you could arrow that guy
[17220.06s -> 17244.09s]  I mean it's not impossible or don't that's fine oh my god guys I think my
[17244.09s -> 17257.35s]  Lux is afk she's been sitting in base for like five minutes. I think she's like
[17257.99s -> 17260.11s]  It literally just rolling there some chips
[17260.91s -> 17273.24s]  All right, let's push this wave
[17273.24s -> 17275.24s]  We could make a pick right now
[17280.16s -> 17283.30s]  Jax, what are you doing man? Why are you up there? Oh, no?
[17283.92s -> 17288.67s]  Also, why does this ash have the worst build I've ever seen?
[17295.68s -> 17298.64s]  Dude, if we lose to the kaisa that just did that I'm gonna lose my mind
[17299.44s -> 17318.52s]  Like I just blind art in without any vision of anybody and just died
[17319.56s -> 17321.56s]  There's just no way we can lose this
[17324.30s -> 17326.30s]  We got this guys just play
[17326.58s -> 17334.37s]  Like I just need to I need help getting vision control on Baron and mid and then we can we can win
[17335.25s -> 17336.81s]  We got this
[17336.81s -> 17418.73s]  Right now. I mean we still got Baron, but he did get two of them. I guess
[17419.25s -> 17423.08s]  Or no, we only yeah, you got a card this an ash
[17424.44s -> 17434.93s]  But we did get Baron, which is very nice. So I'm gonna go Dom's this game
[17435.69s -> 17437.69s]  normally go
[17437.69s -> 17457.34s]  Black Cleaver, but I think I'm gonna go Dom's I need to get vision control on dragon and mid
[17457.34s -> 17473.23s]  I need to get vision control and I need I need help to do it though
[17474.35s -> 17476.35s]  I'm gonna act like I'm backing here
[17483.64s -> 17486.60s]  We should just be pushing mid with Baron. I don't know what we're doing
[17488.08s -> 17491.32s]  Like like low key it should just be straight up like we go mid with Baron here
[17492.16s -> 17504.75s]  What the fuck was that? That was a terrible play
[17521.92s -> 17536.06s]  Guys just just come mid we have Baron nice huge pick push mid push mid
[17537.34s -> 17552.60s]  Fuck dragon just push mid. Okay. Now we back off. Oh, I mean that was
[17553.88s -> 17555.08s]  Bad
[17555.08s -> 17562.20s]  Guys back off back off back off leaf leave leave leave please please just leave
[17566.28s -> 17569.28s]  Guys you can leave you can leave we just go do dragon leave
[17570.04s -> 17575.90s]  We still have so much gold to get on the map. We can go get bot tier two
[17576.66s -> 17578.66s]  bot tier one bot tier two
[17579.14s -> 17581.68s]  We have we have so much gold to get on the map. It's not a big deal, right?
[17581.68s -> 17585.82s]  Like we don't need to end the game right the seconds. We actually have Carthus and we have
[17587.58s -> 17633.12s]  Jax too, so like our scaling is really good. I need to go get I need to go get
[17634.32s -> 17636.32s]  My next item but I need enough gold to do it
[17638.60s -> 17640.60s]  I also need to go get wards
[17640.76s -> 17644.60s]  This sucks. I'm on like a weird buy timer where like I don't have enough things to get
[17645.12s -> 17647.12s]  You know what? I'm just gonna get my ward item
[17648.00s -> 17651.10s]  I'm gonna grab this for right now just so we can actually get some power on the map
[17651.80s -> 17657.12s]  Because the map's so dark, you know, I think getting the word item before finishing my last whisper items probably the smartest call I
[17662.34s -> 17666.58s]  Am a little concerned why we're not pushing bot with Jax. We're pushing top
[17668.34s -> 17670.34s]  And I'm also concerned why we're not
[17671.06s -> 17674.34s]  Playing for mid Pryo, and we're just farming bot side
[17675.78s -> 17677.78s]  This is such an awkward fucking thing
[17677.78s -> 17686.86s]  Like we should just be playing for mid Pryo and use arrow to engage
[17687.38s -> 17690.42s]  That's how we win. We just use arrow to engage when they contest mid
[17691.22s -> 17699.40s]  It's actually that easy
[17699.40s -> 17701.40s]  Like low-key. It's actually that easy
[17708.02s -> 17718.71s]  See watch now this guy's dead. I mean, that's fine with me
[17720.21s -> 17722.37s]  You guys want to ain't to kill me. That's totally fine
[17723.37s -> 17738.18s]  They can get the inhib and then they can back up
[17739.34s -> 17741.34s]  Yeah, I get in here back up
[17741.90s -> 17743.90s]  And then play for play for Baron
[17743.90s -> 17751.22s]  They'll only have a few seconds to do this though, so it's kind of scary because these two are gonna be alive
[17752.42s -> 17759.19s]  They need to back immediately
[17759.63s -> 17766.03s]  Just reset. You don't need the wave just leave leave leave
[17766.59s -> 17768.99s]  Barons up burns up think about the macro as the macro
[17769.83s -> 17771.51s]  We play for Baron now
[17771.51s -> 17780.14s]  Because there's a timer now where like you guys just need to reset because there's a timer where the enemy has tempo on the map
[17780.14s -> 17782.14s]  and if we don't
[17782.70s -> 17784.70s]  if we don't allow
[17784.70s -> 17788.70s]  If we don't reset, they'll just rush Baron and there's nothing we can do about it.
[17788.70s -> 17801.01s]  Okay, they're not on Baron. I think they missed their timer.
[17801.01s -> 17803.01s]  They're on it. No, they're on it. They're on it. They're on it.
[17803.01s -> 17806.70s]  Okay, they're not on it. We're fine.
[17806.70s -> 17815.11s]  We can still fight this though, but we need everybody here.
[17815.11s -> 17824.54s]  Just arrow. Arrow, Ash. Arrow. Arrow.
[17824.54s -> 17827.54s]  Arrow. It doesn't matter if you hit Malph. Just arrow.
[17827.54s -> 17830.54s]  Just arrow him. Thank you.
[17830.54s -> 17838.82s]  No, no. Guys, the backline. The backline.
[17838.82s -> 17845.34s]  Play together. Play together. Yes!
[17845.34s -> 17853.49s]  Nice. End of the game. You end. You end here.
[17854.69s -> 17858.69s]  Lux, don't back. You are giving me cancer. Okay, they forfeit it.
[17858.99s -> 17864.49s]  Dude, look how easy that is. Look how easy it is to win games when people are listening to macro.
[17864.79s -> 17867.69s]  Look how easy it is. Oh my God!
[17869.19s -> 17873.49s]  I'm losing it, man. I swear to God, I'm losing my hair. I can feel my hair falling out right now.
[17873.49s -> 17877.79s]  I can feel it falling out of my fucking head. Like, I just lost the one that's right there.
[17877.79s -> 17886.79s]  like like it's just fucking kill me bad in game god it's so hard I feel so
[17886.79s -> 17897.98s]  exhausted like it's so exhausting you played a 44 minute gold game god damn
[17897.98s -> 17906.26s]  that's impressive I don't want to honor any of these people who would you guys
[17906.26s -> 17910.30s]  honor like out of all of them who'd you guys pick cuz I don't know they all
[17910.30s -> 17912.72s]  In my eyes. I'm too toxic right now. They all suck
[17916.04s -> 17919.99s]  Jax, I'll give it to Jax
[17920.01s -> 17927.86s]  Ash Ash was trying. I'll give you that ash was trying to look at this Lux
[17929.02s -> 17939.91s]  This Lux got so fucking carried. Oh my god. Oh
[17941.05s -> 17943.25s]  Don't type to me you
[17944.21s -> 17949.57s]  pedestrian
[17949.57s -> 17965.74s]  them a pedestrian that's not even an insult like oh yeah yeah wow fucking pedestrian like
[17969.98s -> 17992.86s]  that's not even an insult man dude guys i feel like part of my life gets taken away you know
[17994.78s -> 17998.94s]  like when i play on my main account i'm like super sweaty tryharding and shit i feel like i
[17998.94s -> 18003.02s]  feel like i'm losing like yeah it's like it's like every time i lose it's like one hair
[18003.02s -> 18009.90s]  Like every time I'm like barely win, right? It's just like every game in this elos like one hair on my head gets fucking burnt out
[18009.90s -> 18012.70s]  And it just leaves and I'm not like I'm gonna be looking like Homer Simpson
[18013.18s -> 18037.41s]  Like look at the difference in wards placed. This is what annoys me about bad support players
[18038.17s -> 18040.17s]  This guy plays 23
[18041.05s -> 18044.93s]  He's more focused on getting kills than placing wards and it's really stupid
[18050.88s -> 18054.12s]  Sorry, I just don't listen. I don't have anything against the dog lightning guy
[18054.12s -> 18060.12s]  as a person other than like what I've seen on his stream, right? Like on his stream,
[18060.12s -> 18066.16s]  he just seems really egotistical. Like he's like everything I hate in the average league
[18066.16s -> 18072.68s]  player. He has a massive ego because he reached challenger on the support role on like an
[18072.68s -> 18076.52s]  off meta pick like last year at some point or something or maybe he's challenger right
[18076.52s -> 18080.84s]  now. I don't even know. Maybe he has an account in challenger. I don't even know.
[18080.84s -> 18088.12s]  But it drives me crazy because he doesn't do anything correctly, like he gets away with
[18088.12s -> 18095.24s]  such dumb shit because he basically wins lane because he plays extremely aggressively.
[18095.24s -> 18100.08s]  But if you guys noticed in that game the reason we won lane or we were able to push back is
[18100.08s -> 18104.80s]  because they played aggressively but they did it really stupidly.
[18104.80s -> 18107.84s]  They were fighting us in our own waves.
[18107.84s -> 18110.40s]  On repeat they were just fighting us in our own waves.
[18110.40s -> 18114.52s]  Every time I would just turn a 1 for 1, almost a 1 for 2, every time.
[18114.52s -> 18118.28s]  And it's stupid because every time that's happening they're also giving me souls, right?
[18118.28s -> 18121.88s]  And he would like take weird fights and like, I know he's probably forth-bunny and he doesn't
[18121.88s -> 18125.16s]  care, he's a smurf, blah blah blah, but I just don't like when people like that like
[18125.16s -> 18129.96s]  ego their ass off when they play so badly.
[18129.96s -> 18135.53s]  It drives me crazy.
[18135.53s -> 18136.53s]  Why do I care so much?
[18136.53s -> 18138.09s]  I don't know.
[18138.09s -> 18159.56s]  I don't know.
[18159.56s -> 18161.68s]  How are you guys doing by the way?
[18161.68s -> 18163.20s]  How's everybody's day going in chat?
[18163.20s -> 18164.20s]  What you guys up to?
[18164.20s -> 18169.56s]  I know I stopped like teaching the game and started whining like I got on my main account a few hours ago
[18169.56s -> 18172.36s]  And I stopped teaching and I started whining a bunch. So
[18172.80s -> 18179.31s]  My bad my bad on that one dudes
[18179.99s -> 18182.15s]  How you guys doing now? How's everybody's day gone?
[18189.28s -> 18194.82s]  When the coaching service is open. Oh, I could probably do coaching at some point soon
[18195.76s -> 18199.96s]  like I'd be willing to do some coaching some like sub coaching or something or like
[18199.96s -> 18213.10s]  something like that it might be fun suck me in bronze you don't get enough time
[18213.10s -> 18216.62s]  to actually improve did I feel that man it takes a long time league is not an
[18216.62s -> 18220.98s]  easy game to pick up and start playing right like if you're if you're in bronze
[18220.98s -> 18223.50s]  or silver and you're like oh I actually you know I'm having fun playing the game
[18223.50s -> 18226.78s]  I kind of want to try and get better it's you're just overwhelmed with so much
[18226.78s -> 18235.65s]  info that you like have to play so many games right like I feel you man like
[18235.65s -> 18257.40s]  It's it's overwhelming. Yeah, I I feel you. Well, we got mid. Okay
[18259.16s -> 18260.60s]  Should I just play Trist?
[18260.60s -> 18269.28s]  Well, I'm worried if I picked Trist that we won't have AP, but I also think I'm better at Trist than I am at like
[18269.82s -> 18271.82s]  other stuff
[18271.86s -> 18284.49s]  So, I don't know AP Veris. I'm not good enough at AP Veris man. I'm gonna be real
[18285.09s -> 18291.14s]  Well, my mouse is good, but the problem with mouse is like mouse is a shitty champion
[18291.14s -> 18298.26s]  like Miles is trash right so like he's good but he's like not good in the sense
[18298.26s -> 18302.66s]  of like I can play him well but at the end of the day if they pick something
[18302.66s -> 18310.92s]  that like counters Miles I just lose or is like Tristana is just free to pick
[18310.92s -> 18316.24s]  like even if we play all AD right let's say we do all AD or some shit like on
[18316.24s -> 18320.16s]  accidents or because people are one treks blah blah blah it's it's still free
[18320.16s -> 18326.00s]  Like Tristana is still like a good pick because even with all ad she's still like you can build Lord Dom's
[18326.64s -> 18331.48s]  She has incredibly high pressure early game if you play her right right like you could push the waves Rome
[18332.08s -> 18337.16s]  You can you can roam top room bot help lanes out like level 2 3 you can invade junglers early
[18337.40s -> 18339.40s]  Like she's just incredibly incredibly strong
[18339.88s -> 18343.39s]  This guy should go pike
[18343.87s -> 18349.35s]  I was gonna say they picked new new and I picked an 80 mid they picked new new and Thresh
[18350.15s -> 18352.15s]  We should have an engage
[18352.15s -> 18357.61s]  Cuz cuz pike Trist like I can just walk bot on repeat now and pretty much kill people
[18367.76s -> 18371.80s]  Watch an iron game watching an iron game. I feel like it wouldn't be an actual iron game though
[18371.80s -> 18379.05s]  Would it I've heard I had friends who are contentionally lost a bunch of games
[18380.65s -> 18387.21s]  And so they could get to iron four right they like they like into down to iron four or whatever to see if they
[18387.21s -> 18389.21s]  could make it and
[18389.21s -> 18396.49s]  Uh, there's just so many like smurfs in iron.
[18396.49s -> 18400.97s]  There's like legitimate bot, bot accounts.
[18400.97s -> 18403.17s]  Like like accounts that are like being botted.
[18403.17s -> 18404.17s]  Right?
[18404.17s -> 18405.73s]  There's like botted accounts in iron.
[18405.73s -> 18416.04s]  There's like smurfs all over the place.
[18416.04s -> 18417.04s]  It seems to have stopped.
[18417.04s -> 18421.88s]  I wonder if Riot like did something that stopped the bots.
[18421.88s -> 18425.00s]  They must they may have like they may have just incorporated something that like stops
[18425.00s -> 18431.04s]  the software, but I don't know.
[18431.04s -> 18434.76s]  I haven't heard anything about it, but I have no clue.
[18434.76s -> 18460.07s]  I'll be real, I don't know.
[18460.07s -> 18461.27s]  You had to take Foggy around last game,
[18461.27s -> 18462.11s]  it got boots one.
[18462.11s -> 18462.95s]  Boom.
[18462.95s -> 18469.03s]  Dude, that sounds awful.
[18469.03s -> 18472.23s]  I kind of feel bad for actual iron players
[18472.23s -> 18476.07s]  who are like in iron trying to climb
[18476.07s -> 18492.76s]  because like that sounds bad.
[18492.76s -> 18494.76s]  I do think you can climb obviously out of any elo,
[18494.76s -> 18495.60s]  it doesn't matter, right?
[18495.60s -> 18497.00s]  Like if I were to go into an iron game,
[18497.00s -> 18500.80s]  I'd probably drop like 50 kills.
[18500.80s -> 18520.00s]  but I so I do think you can climb out of any you know any you know for sure you love only a
[18520.00s -> 18523.76s]  new account a few years ago you had a bot account that answered every time I wrote bot
[18530.80s -> 18543.93s]  that's funny yeah I assume that's a good point I guess if you're in iron you could like play to
[18543.93s -> 18547.13s]  learn the game a bit better and then you could like play a new account and see where you got
[18547.69s -> 18560.22s]  yeah I know that would work that makes sense sure I'll first pick man I'll first pick Senna
[18560.22s -> 18567.72s]  I guarantee they walk in fucking these people are gonna walk in fucking
[18568.42s -> 18570.42s]  Nautilus or some shits
[18570.54s -> 18572.54s]  They'll be like Jarvan
[18572.54s -> 18574.54s]  Nautilus
[18576.38s -> 18582.94s]  I don't even know
[18582.94s -> 18587.48s]  Riven's not too bad for Senna. It's okay. They'll get flanked. I actually don't think Riven's too bad right now
[18587.64s -> 18591.30s]  Maybe all the Riven players I played against suck, but I don't think she's actually that bad
[18591.30s -> 18594.28s]  I think Riven's like just you have to position well
[18594.28s -> 18597.72s]  I think ribbon's really broken at abusing positioning
[18598.32s -> 18606.16s]  That's why she's so good. It's all cue like good ribbon players. I'll get really gross flanks and the flanks are what's OP?
[18606.16s -> 18609.12s]  Yeah, there's the Gragas. Okay. I was like, they're gonna play something to fuck me over
[18609.76s -> 18614.86s]  This guy picked Gragas, but it was gonna be like J4 or Gragas or something
[18615.74s -> 18618.34s]  And then this guy is the support. He'll probably pick Nautilus
[18620.02s -> 18622.02s]  Unless he's a one-trick
[18622.02s -> 18629.66s]  Unless this guy's straight up just like A1 trick, he'll pick like Nautilus or some shits.
[18629.66s -> 18630.66s]  Maybe Rakan.
[18630.66s -> 18631.66s]  Rakan or Nautilus.
[18631.66s -> 18642.11s]  Cause if he picks an Enchanter, we just win the game.
[18642.11s -> 18647.84s]  He has to pick Engage.
[18647.84s -> 18651.28s]  Milio would be really good here too, actually.
[18651.28s -> 18653.80s]  Cause Milio would counter half our team.
[18653.80s -> 18657.28s]  You can Milio Q, Wukong, and Kennen Engage.
[18657.28s -> 18663.82s]  Like if this guy played Milio, this would actually be a hard lane.
[18663.82s -> 18664.82s]  Tom Kench?
[18664.82s -> 18670.85s]  I mean I I get it, but I think it's bad
[18672.71s -> 18674.71s]  Runes oh shit
[18675.17s -> 18679.85s]  Yo, you just saved me looking like an absolute fool. Thank you
[18681.31s -> 18685.37s]  Holy crap if you wanted to see my runes they're here, but thank you you reminded me. Yeah, I'm gonna be over here
[18685.37s -> 18687.37s]  I'm gonna get some water. I'll be right back
[18687.51s -> 18730.77s]  Get some agua. By the way the people who are here to watch me play AD carry
[18732.03s -> 18734.03s]  I sincerely apologize I
[18734.03s -> 18743.64s]  I know watching me play Senna is probably boring as fuck, okay? I know
[18744.52s -> 18749.52s]  And I promise you we will play ad carry at some point. I promise you I
[18749.96s -> 18753.14s]  Played like the first four hours of the stream was ad carry or the first three
[18753.48s -> 18757.12s]  Right, I played on my smurf for a few games and played some ad so if you want to watch that you can go back
[18757.12s -> 18759.24s]  In the bottom we did some my commentary and shit
[18761.28s -> 18765.32s]  The only reason I'm playing so much Senna and support on this account is because like
[18765.32s -> 18772.20s]  Like, the elo I'm currently in is like the worst elo to climb in solo queue because of
[18772.20s -> 18780.44s]  a lot of factors and support has some of the highest impact on the game, whereas like adc
[18780.44s -> 18785.16s]  has high impact late, but in solo queue you want to have high impact early, and I wanted
[18785.16s -> 18820.84s]  to be able to impact the game early on, so yeah, sorry about being boring and shit.
[18820.84s -> 18825.52s]  I just really want to like win games, at least on this account.
[18825.52s -> 18845.56s]  I want to get out of the silo because the faster I get out of the silo, the faster I can have
[18845.56s -> 18849.76s]  fun playing AD carry and like trying to climb.
[18849.76s -> 18854.96s]  What a weird, like what a weird play by these guys, what the fuck?
[18854.96s -> 18861.88s]  They like half shoved the waves to get like early bush control and then they do shit
[18861.88s -> 18880.50s]  like that. This guy's just dead. I'm gonna give it to Twitch. Nice. We got his exhaust.
[18880.50s -> 18886.90s]  So I wasted my exhaust there. I did it because I thought the Jinx was gonna insta flash. Like
[18886.90s -> 18890.34s]  I didn't exhaust it because I was like scared of her damage. I did it because I thought
[18890.34s -> 18896.50s]  she was gonna like try and flash away the second that, uh, but I landed my snare.
[18896.50s -> 18899.78s]  It was kind of bad by me. I mean I landed my snare so I didn't need to exhaust her.
[18899.78s -> 18903.32s]  This looks like oh, maybe she'll flash she did not she did not flash
[18905.14s -> 18908.42s]  What do you know is this this 500 LP Masters 400 LP?
[18910.26s -> 18912.26s]  Insane, I know
[18912.54s -> 18938.01s]  Absolutely crazy put that ward there because Gragas is probably bot. Yeah
[18939.77s -> 18948.42s]  So
[18948.42s -> 18955.14s]  They're trying to come up from bot to kill me here like their bot lanes rotating up to try and kill me
[18955.14s -> 18962.78s]  So, just be careful Twitch, they're in here man.
[18962.78s -> 18972.96s]  I actually have to back and walk, look.
[18972.96s -> 18976.20s]  This is hilarious, the enemy bot lane literally is roaming mid.
[18976.20s -> 18977.20s]  Look at this.
[18977.20s -> 18978.20s]  What?
[18978.20s -> 18981.08s]  Why?
[18981.08s -> 18991.09s]  I'm not trying to soak his XP, I just want those souls.
[18991.09s -> 19006.07s]  I'm scared to walk in here, I don't know where Gragas is.
[19006.07s -> 19011.21s]  I gotta come bot to help my Twitch so they don't freeze the wave.
[19011.21s -> 19016.12s]  Like I don't want them to be able to freeze here.
[19016.12s -> 19022.25s]  of Gragas ganks we win we win the fight right now like it's an easy fight when as
[19022.25s -> 19032.78s]  long as we don't get knocked up we just win the fight automatically actually
[19032.78s -> 19051.86s]  we're trying to bait Gragas to come gank this easy double flashes baby easy you
[19051.86s -> 19070.28s]  fucking cowards we should back up like I can go by now oh Gragas is top we could
[19070.28s -> 19075.92s]  actually maybe do dragon yo I'm gonna be real a soul roaming is not a not in
[19075.92s -> 19078.40s]  Like the top list of me being like nervous about it
[19079.28s -> 19082.66s]  Like I'm not nervous about a soul roaming man
[19083.26s -> 19088.66s]  Push this so we can oh, we're diving them
[19089.70s -> 19093.30s]  That's a bit scary. Welcome to the League of Draven
[19094.14s -> 19099.34s]  Good to see you're back to enjoying the game. Whoa. We're going still diving that that's not good
[19100.06s -> 19109.48s]  Like we back off here, man. I mean we can maybe go up here if you really want to I
[19115.22s -> 19117.22s]  Kind of award this I
[19123.26s -> 19125.38s]  Need to reset though really badly right now
[19125.86s -> 19138.23s]  like really badly not being on the map here is really bad or rather not like
[19138.23s -> 19141.83s]  having gold spent and being on the map is what I meant to say like it's really
[19141.83s -> 19146.11s]  fucking bad and yo back up you know Gragas that you watched him walk past
[19146.11s -> 19150.83s]  three wards that's why I just warded no no he's still here
[19150.83s -> 19156.67s]  Gragas is right there like we know Gragas is somewhere bot lane right
[19156.67s -> 19165.01s]  I don't know where but we know he's there. They're on dragon. Okay
[19165.93s -> 19167.93s]  We can fight this go go go
[19168.33s -> 19186.65s]  W over I'm here. Nice. Yo, come here
[19188.13s -> 19191.09s]  Y'all help you come get this mother first blue. I
[19192.93s -> 19211.01s]  Got you, baby
[19211.01s -> 19220.28s]  What the fuck made a bitch?
[19221.36s -> 19228.96s]  Well, I guess I'll back
[19230.08s -> 19234.52s]  Yo Spartan, thank you for the six months man. Welcome back. Appreciate it
[19235.60s -> 19239.00s]  I guess we'll back, we'll get our fuckin' Umbrell.
[19239.00s -> 19246.04s]  Uh, I'm gonna go top side of the map now, and I'm gonna help my team get Rift Herald's.
[19246.04s -> 19256.42s]  I'm gonna ping, I wanna go top side, I wanna help my team get Rift's.
[19256.42s -> 19260.14s]  The wave, if we look at bot wave, it's pushing into us, it's totally fine.
[19260.14s -> 19261.14s]  Okay?
[19261.14s -> 19264.06s]  Twitch is level six.
[19264.06s -> 19266.74s]  The bot wave's pushing in, we are totally fine.
[19266.74s -> 19274.03s]  To do what I'm doing right now.
[19274.03s -> 19286.05s]  He doesn't know I'm here.
[19286.05s -> 19287.05s]  I'm dead though.
[19293.45s -> 19294.45s]  Rooooooow.
[19297.07s -> 19299.27s]  No joke, I almost juked that.
[19300.59s -> 19301.59s]  That's so close.
[19302.03s -> 19305.75s]  I was hoping, like, Wukong for some reason didn't walk topside.
[19306.43s -> 19308.67s]  Uh, but the enemy bot lane did?
[19313.23s -> 19315.43s]  Okay, the enemy bot lane just griefed their entire game.
[19315.59s -> 19316.59s]  The game's over, we win.
[19317.19s -> 19318.63s]  What the fuck are they doing?
[19318.75s -> 19319.75s]  What is happening?
[19322.29s -> 19324.17s]  Like, my twitch is just getting free plates.
[19330.18s -> 19331.70s]  Wait, you guys are griefing.
[19340.14s -> 19341.14s]  I'm griefing.
[19341.26s -> 19350.74s]  dude what the fuck we why would you fight them guys guys guys wukong wukong
[19350.74s -> 19356.10s]  okay we see that our twitch is getting free plate spot free first turret okay
[19356.10s -> 19361.66s]  I'm backed I almost soloed their ad carry okay or their jungler why would you
[19361.66s -> 19369.90s]  ever on purpose take a for a fight like that with no oh I have cancer I
[19369.90s -> 19376.90s]  Also, the Wukong's an idiot. He doesn't understand macro at all, apparently, because I literally
[19376.90s -> 19384.90s]  pinged to come to Rift. My Wukong was, like, nervous. Like, for some reason Wukong didn't
[19384.90s -> 19392.54s]  walk top. He sat bot trying to gank. But the objective was Rift, not... God, I'm losing
[19392.54s -> 19398.00s]  my mind in this elo. Master's players are literally just diamond players with slightly
[19398.00s -> 19402.44s]  better mechanics. They don't know anything about the game and my brain's about to explode
[19402.44s -> 19411.46s]  like a peanut. It's not about them laning 2v2 you fucking cumquat. Dude I know they can't
[19411.46s -> 19416.98s]  lane against us 2v2. It's not about the 2v2 man. We get a free Rift Herald because we
[19416.98s -> 19420.64s]  shut down their bot lane and I'm on an item spike. So we just automatically get a free
[19420.64s -> 19434.47s]  Rift. It has nothing to do with 2v2. This cumquat motherfucker. I don't know why that's
[19434.47s -> 19449.80s]  my insult the pressuring guy got to me somehow where the fuck is this war oh
[19449.80s -> 19459.72s]  cuz I'm telling you right now my macro there was a hundred percent correct by
[19459.72s -> 19474.37s]  the way like 1000% like even though I died I know it was correct no no just
[19474.37s -> 19478.61s]  do dragon do not dive guys we don't have to not everything's about kills not
[19478.61s -> 19482.49s]  everything's about kills we got this like you don't need to dive you don't
[19482.49s -> 19485.29s]  need to dive always you don't need to see a kill be like ooh monkey kill
[19485.29s -> 19490.81s]  brain go like the game is about like getting objectives on timers and playing
[19490.81s -> 19495.51s]  off of tempo and things like that like the only reason we even lost rift was
[19495.51s -> 19499.69s]  because my wukong went full monkey brain and was like no we need to not play
[19499.69s -> 19529.41s]  for this rift with a giant massive lead wait kill this guy one of my watching
[19529.41s -> 19535.85s]  right now this is outrageous my wukong just solo ulted there dude I'm gonna
[19535.85s -> 19553.06s]  lose it. My Wukong just solo ulted their Gragas. On a good note though, they don't get any plates
[19553.06s -> 19559.38s]  off of rifting, so it's not that bad. Okay man, just push. Like, dude, hit the minions. Like, stop.
[19561.99s -> 19570.15s]  My bad. Sorry, I'm wound up right now, Kenan. Okay. I'm gonna wound. Apologies if I griefed you,
[19570.15s -> 19579.99s]  I just don't like when stuff like that happens.
[19579.99s -> 19589.11s]  I'm a perfectionist and it's my biggest flaw is that I will play the game 100% correctly
[19589.11s -> 19594.35s]  on tempo and timers but you can't do that because you gotta remember to your teammates
[19594.35s -> 19601.42s]  teammates like they're not just gonna instantly know exactly what you're what
[19601.42s -> 19618.45s]  what to do we win that guy don't just stand here and watch me die man holy
[19618.45s -> 19628.63s]  shits that is oh my god if he if he had let me die there I might have screamed
[19628.63s -> 19637.11s]  actually screamed out loud in anger like dude is watching me kite these people
[19637.11s -> 19642.63s]  within one inch of my life and instead of like helping or walking up and doing anything you know what he does
[19645.35s -> 19653.85s]  he pulls a fucking gross score my man just likes to watch something wrong with it but
[19653.85s -> 19673.58s]  you know there's a time and a place i don't actually want to buy pinks because i don't think
[19673.58s -> 19677.26s]  we're strong enough that uh i don't think that we're strong enough that i can actually even
[19677.26s -> 19681.50s]  defend the pinks right now if i'm being honest like we should be strong enough but we kind
[19681.50s -> 19697.78s]  of throw a lead when I overforced the rift so I think I think we need to push this wave
[19697.78s -> 19703.46s]  so that we can get tempo and move around the map prior sorry I keep saying the wrong thing
[19709.22s -> 19715.22s]  uh-oh that guy's dead I have to ditch that guy he's dead as fuck oh I'm dead too maybe
[19716.26s -> 19723.30s]  oh I am so dead yeah that was my bad that was my bad my bad my bad like I we just got we
[19723.30s -> 19731.92s]  We just got ran down. That was on me like we we had good positioning, but the jungler wasn't
[19732.52s -> 19740.32s]  Close enough. So this is my bed. I also didn't expect to get fucking four man's, but I should have right
[19740.96s -> 19747.53s]  We should play for this though. I wish I could type. I wish I wasn't chat restricted for a year
[19749.15s -> 19751.79s]  Dude, I swear to God. I'm not even being mean
[19752.63s -> 19756.59s]  Like riot was like they chat restricted me because I type so much macro
[19756.59s -> 19766.73s]  that it gets on people's nerves and they don't want me spam typing low-key don't
[19766.73s -> 19782.55s]  play rip don't play for refs I need help guys if you guys can help we need the
[19782.55s -> 19800.19s]  clear vision on dragon a year yeah I get uncharted April 15th or April 11th or
[19800.19s -> 19807.91s]  some shit 2024 I've never seen it it must have been like an actual riot or
[19807.91s -> 19813.51s]  something like I've never seen an automated system give you a year chat restricts right so in my mind
[19813.51s -> 19822.34s]  it's got to be like an actual like like a rioter was like dronimo we know you're good enough to climb
[19822.34s -> 19834.29s]  but stop typing you know i mean that's like what must have been going on and i'm like okay well
[19835.65s -> 19856.00s]  sure i mean i didn't know you could get chat banned a year what's weird is like i i said i don't
[19856.00s -> 19859.56s]  I don't like say trigger words. It's not like I tell people to like end themselves and stuff
[19860.00s -> 19865.06s]  It's mainly just me typing like go here do that do this like I type a lot, right?
[19865.28s -> 19869.12s]  Which is obviously like if you type a lot it can be toxic as well, so
[19872.86s -> 19874.78s]  Like typing a lot's annoying so I get it
[19886.25s -> 19889.41s]  We should be playing for baron side vision right now not
[19890.57s -> 19893.45s]  The vision we're playing with right now is bad. We should be playing over here
[19895.17s -> 19899.21s]  Like I want to play for Baron vision, but it's a little hard to do that right now
[19899.25s -> 19907.92s]  Because you see how Tom kenshin me are like transferring vision control around the map right now
[19908.42s -> 19912.06s]  We're playing this little support game of like hide the vision
[19913.46s -> 19916.52s]  Look at this fuck look at this motherfucker
[19927.21s -> 19931.44s]  Oh
[19931.44s -> 19933.44s]  He's so dumb. I
[19941.70s -> 19943.46s]  Still think he's dumb
[19943.46s -> 19953.69s]  How did I just take me?
[19958.63s -> 19960.63s]  tonight I
[19960.63s -> 19968.70s]  Took my entire HP bar in a global my bad dude. I really wish the mouth fight would group though. I
[19969.82s -> 19973.30s]  Get that he's like doing the thing where he's like, oh, let's you know split
[19973.30s -> 19975.94s]  I like his play was actually really smart there
[19976.54s -> 19980.58s]  The mouth fights play I mean like that wasn't his fault that we got shit on at all
[19980.58s -> 19985.46s]  I just wish that he would group because if he groups up and hit hits are we win every team fight
[19986.26s -> 19991.22s]  Because right now our only frontliner is the wukong right and the fact that wukong's our frontliner
[19991.22s -> 19993.22s]  We don't have the ability to play the game
[19994.74s -> 19996.74s]  Well, I get stuck on that what the fuck was that?
[19997.98s -> 20004.78s]  Like that Tom kinch getting to e-forward like that blindly into our entire team and then not getting punished for it
[20004.78s -> 20007.22s]  It might be the most like solo queue thing I've ever seen
[20007.82s -> 20010.70s]  nobody wanted to hit him because he was the tank but
[20012.42s -> 20014.98s]  Yeah, that's we should still kill him, you know
[20016.00s -> 20024.43s]  We can fight this guy. Oh my god jungler just come oh
[20025.99s -> 20028.11s]  We're forfeiting. Oh, okay. Now that makes perfect sense, right?
[20030.27s -> 20031.91s]  Just come group
[20031.91s -> 20034.51s]  Bro, Ken and come group. Please guys
[20035.19s -> 20038.83s]  Like I don't know why everybody's frustrated. We're literally still up in gold
[20039.71s -> 20041.87s]  Please come group up. We just took an inhibitor
[20042.83s -> 20044.83s]  Just just come group
[20045.75s -> 20048.79s]  Help me get vision on this dragon so that I don't so we don't die
[20049.55s -> 20052.79s]  Like I need my team to actually walk over here to help me get vision
[20055.06s -> 20059.82s]  It's really frustrating because I need the front liners the woo-kong in the mouth fight to walk in with me
[20060.44s -> 20064.16s]  Because I'm a little fucking why I have a big gun, but I'm a big gun girl
[20064.16s -> 20068.90s]  Right, so I need I need these two guys to walk in with me these two big Burley Mountain men
[20074.36s -> 20079.76s]  So that I can play the game, you know, no, we don't push bot no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[20079.90s -> 20080.96s]  mid
[20080.96s -> 20082.96s]  No bot is worthless come in
[20083.38s -> 20087.20s]  My mouth fights pushing the wave that we already have down. I wish I could macro
[20087.20s -> 20095.86s]  macro. I wish I could type some macro right now. My team is so lost. They're so beyond
[20095.86s -> 20111.24s]  lost right now, it's crazy. They're lost this shit. Just do Dragon, just do this. I'll
[20111.24s -> 20115.04s]  start it for you. Here you go. I don't know why we're standing in a bush waiting for
[20115.04s -> 20124.36s]  them to face check. Do Dragon, guys. I swear to God, you have to do everything in the
[20124.36s -> 20130.16s]  Zelo where you have to start every fight. Basically, I have to start every fight.
[20130.16s -> 20133.78s]  I have to not only start every fight, but I have to like ping my team what to do exactly
[20134.28s -> 20136.76s]  Because everybody plays so safe in this elo
[20137.40s -> 20139.66s]  Why did my mouth fight just stop his back?
[20141.50s -> 20143.50s]  Why are you all fighting? Oh
[20147.57s -> 20149.57s]  My god, please guys
[20149.65s -> 20154.69s]  It's fine. It's fine fine
[20155.13s -> 20160.35s]  No mouth fight. You can't 1v9 that just back off. They didn't get anything. They didn't get anything
[20160.35s -> 20162.63s]  We got dragon or on dragon soul points

[20533.55s -> 20538.07s]  feel like what Walter White felt like dealing with Skyler for literally three
[20538.07s -> 20543.43s]  years like this is outrageous this is what this feels like like I do I can
[20543.43s -> 20579.80s]  relate to the show so much more oh my god like dude I oh oh crap look it just
[20579.80s -> 20590.70s]  look at the like look at like what's going on in the game like I I don't even
[20590.70s -> 20597.69s]  mean to be mean about this it's just this is this is crazy mouth fight though
[20597.69s -> 20613.99s]  popping off mouth fight popping off like what are you lose this guy oh he's
[20613.99s -> 20622.70s]  literally diamond why is this guy in this game I mean I feel I feel like
[20622.70s -> 20626.06s]  confused now I'm not even blaming the Wukong anymore I don't know why this
[20626.06s -> 20636.03s]  guy is in the game oh he has inflated that's MMR oh he just has previous
[20636.03s -> 20642.35s]  season inflated MMR that's what the sense because he was GM for three years so
[20642.35s -> 20645.81s]  the his MMR says that he like belongs here even though he doesn't play like I
[20645.81s -> 20652.24s]  bet you last season he only played like 50 games I can look right we just see
[20652.24s -> 20655.16s]  like how many games he played yeah he played what he played like 50 games
[20655.16s -> 20659.48s]  last season so like his MMR didn't really change he just got masters and then stopped
[20661.00s -> 20672.10s]  which is fine there's nothing wrong with that I just wish he would chill you know
[20673.86s -> 20681.33s]  like like uh not rage quit halfway through the game because like I said people's elo and
[20681.33s -> 20684.53s]  shit used to bother me a lot I don't I don't get bothered by anymore because I realized it was
[20684.53s -> 20688.45s]  cringe I don't care about their elo and shit what I care about is like I just want them to
[20688.45s -> 20692.85s]  play the game you know what I mean like I just want them to not rage not not like be absolute
[20692.85s -> 20696.41s]  apes in the game and just play that's all I ask for I don't care if you're a
[20696.41s -> 20698.85s]  diamond player plot player in the game and you're just like accidentally in the
[20698.85s -> 20706.23s]  game it's not your fault I just want you to push buttons what I'm doing wrong to
[20706.23s -> 20713.68s]  have a 36% win rate I can't see the link because just you'd have to give me
[20713.68s -> 20719.49s]  your name and your server how you guys doing by the way everybody having a
[20719.49s -> 20724.25s]  good day you guys enjoying the stream having a good time watching me go bald

[20779.29s -> 20782.13s]  swapped did you guys see that shit they're like oh yeah the support could
[20782.13s -> 20787.85s]  do it and then he banned Senna I mean I didn't hover it so that's my bad god
[20787.85s -> 20794.40s]  damn it I should have hovered I was just like taking my pants off and now
[20794.40s -> 20803.19s]  he wants first pick dude what oh my god I don't I don't know I don't know what

[20813.63s -> 20827.70s]  Thursday right guys it is okay cool oh what do I play they have Zareth and
[20827.70s -> 20841.25s]  the Zen if Zaya I mean I guess I could just play recon it's not big deal let's
[20841.25s -> 20843.49s]  see what their balling is though I actually have to see what their balling
[20843.49s -> 20854.92s]  is to choose my runes so no no oh they have an Israel the fuck is their team comp
[20854.92s -> 20882.75s]  um okay when you do this build what's the secondary supposed to be I think it's
[20882.75s -> 20891.59s]  supposed to be this or maybe like revitalize I just like I'm flinching so
[20891.59s -> 20899.20s]  good oh they have a support grr Zarath so supports that yeah yeah okay so I
[20899.20s -> 20904.20s]  I want, uh, I definitely want glacial hair and I want,
[20905.64s -> 20908.40s]  maybe I take M.R. actually instead of armor
[20908.40s -> 20910.04s]  cause they have two poke champs
[20911.12s -> 20912.60s]  and I take this.
[20912.60s -> 20913.60s]  Yeah, yeah, this is good.
[20913.60s -> 20917.08s]  Okay.
[20917.08s -> 20917.92s]  That's not bad.
[20917.92s -> 20918.76s]  Okay.
[20918.76s -> 20919.72s]  One sec, I'll be right back.
[20919.72s -> 20967.65s]  I need to get some more water.
[20967.65s -> 20983.29s]  There's red, 30 seconds until minion spawn.
[20983.29s -> 20988.03s]  Burn it in here, burn it in here.
[20988.03s -> 20988.87s]  Oh shit.
[20988.87s -> 20995.67s]  flag me f**k man I had a pee f**king flag me for AFK cuz I didn't take a week
[20995.67s -> 21000.80s]  can you not start with AD carry then move over to support I always fall asleep
[21000.80s -> 21007.16s]  before the AD carry gameplay wait what I fell asleep before AD carry what do you
[21007.16s -> 21015.16s]  mean oh you mean like start with my main and then play yeah I played AD carry
[21015.16s -> 21034.55s]  at the start I should probably play 80 carry more over support later in the
[21034.55s -> 21058.04s]  stream here I'll play an 80 carry game after this I feel bad oh it's Gragas I
[21058.04s -> 21065.53s]  thought it was gonna be Zerath but it's Gragas I don't want to fight too hard
[21065.53s -> 21068.21s]  level one even though that guy I should have gone in there that was my
[21068.21s -> 21071.65s]  bad I want to I want to try and get level two here even though I think we
[21071.65s -> 21078.62s]  actually win level one oh I got his bone plating yeah I should have fought
[21078.62s -> 21082.86s]  level one that was my bad because we went very hard level one I just griefed
[21082.86s -> 21087.66s]  it like all I have to do there is go in on the Ezreal or the Gragas level one
[21087.66s -> 21110.66s]  and they can't play the game right it's not worth it's not worth there's no
[21110.66s -> 21116.69s]  way that I can not get E'd by Gragas there by the way I don't know if I
[21116.69s -> 21138.68s]  can flash W there maybe we shouldn't be egoing buddy guys just fucking egos in front of me
[21138.68s -> 21172.28s]  like what okay I might have missed everything there but like you know it's okay it's a little
[21172.28s -> 21189.19s]  counterproductive when I take a tower shot to land a Q feels a little counterproductive
[21189.19s -> 21199.68s]  But hey, I'm going to back here just in case the enemy Zin tries to gank him in.
[21199.68s -> 21209.69s]  Dude, I'm so sad I can't get boots.
[21209.69s -> 21210.69s]  I'm going to wait.
[21210.69s -> 21211.81s]  Yeah, I'm going to be cringe.
[21211.81s -> 21213.49s]  I'm going to wait.
[21213.49s -> 21216.65s]  I would never wait here normally, but you know what, it's just, it's so like, it's
[21216.65s -> 21219.13s]  such a big buy.
[21219.13s -> 21224.33s]  I don't want to, I'm, I'm, now that I've waited and beat cringe, now I have to sit
[21224.33s -> 21225.33s]  here and wait.
[21225.33s -> 21226.33s]  Oh, it's so painful.
[21226.33s -> 21227.33s]  Okay, I'm on my way.
[21227.33s -> 21229.33s]  I'm sorry guys
[21247.41s -> 21254.10s]  Worth the wait. Nah, not at all. I got lucky, but
[21254.94s -> 21269.71s]  You know what's interesting? I'd never use the stupid dematerializer
[21269.71s -> 21274.63s]  I think I should have like I should use it on every cannon or some shit, but I just don't do it
[21275.15s -> 21278.15s]  Because I know the reason you're supposed to use it is because it helps you push
[21278.83s -> 21281.63s]  Because you can do you materialize the cannon right and just instead. Yeah
[21282.39s -> 21285.79s]  So you're supposed to use it because it's like a really fast way to push, but it's also a I
[21285.79s -> 21310.02s]  I should not have W'd. Fuck! Not the Gragas anyway. I fucked up. I shouldn't have W'd the Gragas. I should have played it slower.
[21312.71s -> 21314.71s]  This guy's gonna die.
[21316.71s -> 21319.71s]  Oh! He's gonna die. He put himself against the wall. GG.
[21321.71s -> 21323.71s]  That was my fault though. 100%.
[21327.94s -> 21332.94s]  Because if I didn't W in, they can't kill us, right? And Gragas probably dies to the auto attack anyway.
[21332.94s -> 21339.20s]  My thought process was Greg is snared. So if I w here, but even after like even if I don't get Eed
[21339.20s -> 21341.20s]  I'm pretty confident. I die
[21377.41s -> 21387.98s]  Yeah, man, I tried I was out of everything. I wonder if I could have played that better
[21388.62s -> 21391.46s]  Maybe like if I could have weaved an extra auto in or something
[21394.68s -> 21414.28s]  It's hard to know I'm gonna go mid here I
[21415.28s -> 21422.36s]  Can't okay what could go mid, but I think I I think I want to sit bot for a bit and get some XP
[21424.74s -> 21450.22s]  Think it's smarter to do that at this points. I think we should push this. I don't want to W in because I know Zen's area
[21451.70s -> 21470.89s]  That's why I didn't want to W because I know Zen's here. They were just making it so obvious, right? Like that
[21470.89s -> 21472.89s]  It was like
[21472.89s -> 21477.01s]  Sometimes when people make shit too good to be true it is too good to be true
[21478.57s -> 21481.69s]  Like oh shit, we're just gonna they're just gonna fight us here cool. Oh
[21483.45s -> 21485.45s]  Yeah, I gotta help him push my bad
[21485.45s -> 21522.23s]  I'm playing sloppy you just want to see a cool trick watch this she could push the
[21522.23s -> 21531.28s]  wave and then just min max the back yeah how cool was that she just pushes the
[21531.28s -> 21533.88s]  wave I just back next to the bush and she's just like oh I guess I'll take the
[21533.88s -> 21565.16s]  free ride I really need level six badly like bro I really cannot get level six
[21565.16s -> 21575.45s]  right now this is painful hey kill these maybe I'm six off this nope
[21575.45s -> 21613.39s]  guess not i was gonna stay mid there by the way and help the homie i need to go mid this is so
[21613.39s -> 21642.68s]  awkward bro help me bro like you gotta walk to me like i can't like my eve is like here i'm way
[21642.68s -> 21652.17s]  over here right and my eve's like yo homie like dude i'm like we're trying to push the wave in for
[21652.17s -> 21661.37s]  her and she's just not accepting to wait and I can't W the wall I mean I guess I
[21661.37s -> 21665.05s]  could W the wall because I was trying to walk around right I saw her in trouble
[21665.05s -> 21668.61s]  when I was here so I wanted her to walk towards here so I could E over the wall
[21668.61s -> 21673.69s]  that was my thought process E over the wall helped the guy but he like didn't
[21673.69s -> 21682.35s]  understand that and I just got shit on and it felt really bad both our
[21682.35s -> 21689.17s]  solos are getting absolutely shit on this is very bad because I don't know
[21689.17s -> 21697.56s]  how to help our team at this stage. Like I'm just always behind on tempo now around the
[21697.56s -> 21727.28s]  map in the wrong spot at the wrong time. This is so awkward. I have ult, we could kill this
[21727.28s -> 21756.49s]  guy. I guess not. We could maybe kill Zin if I sneak in here. Push the wave, push the
[21756.49s -> 21781.82s]  wave, hurry. He's gotta crash it. I mean this guy is just dead. My AD carry is
[21781.82s -> 21786.46s]  gonna get fucked for it though so I hope it was worth like my ad carry is gonna get zones
[21793.64s -> 21796.92s]  it's really hard to tell if anything like that's worth sometimes because
[21798.76s -> 21802.12s]  I used my ult before a dragon fight we're gonna lose bot tower there's just so many
[21802.12s -> 21826.84s]  factors right it's so hard and now I don't have words oh it's so rough I got the ignite off
[21826.84s -> 21834.44s]  but dude I can't believe that Gragas lived no oh I had stopwatch I have stopwatch oh my god
[21834.44s -> 21839.82s]  I'm the worst player in existence. I actually have the ability just to live there. Oh
[21840.82s -> 21845.05s]  No, I should sell
[21846.21s -> 21848.21s]  My magi is in shame. I
[21849.11s -> 21851.03s]  Actually just want the item so
[21852.69s -> 21854.69s]  Dude, I'm so bad
[21855.41s -> 21859.73s]  Dude, Gragas is low key a good pick versus Rakan though. You can stop his engage so easily
[21868.64s -> 21870.64s]  It's actually low key a good pick
[21896.45s -> 21921.89s]  bro
[21921.89s -> 21941.74s]  Nice not bad. I kind of want to back off here. You don't feel it's kind of bad. You guys noticed that I just I got my
[21943.32s -> 21945.84s]  I don't know if you guys noticed this, but I got my fucking I
[21948.93s -> 21954.17s]  Got like four assists just now, but it was after I sold my Maja's
[21954.53s -> 21956.89s]  How fucking bad does that feel?
[21958.01s -> 21960.01s]  Like actually oh
[21964.04s -> 21966.48s]  By the way, I wanted to ask you guys
[21966.48s -> 21973.92s]  What 80 carry do you guys think is the most sought out for people to learn right now?
[21973.92s -> 21981.53s]  Like what would you say is like people want to learn this 80 carry over other 80 carries?
[21981.53s -> 21983.09s]  What are you guys thinking?
[21983.09s -> 21985.85s]  My man says Teemo, okay.
[21985.85s -> 21987.25s]  Makes sense.
[21987.25s -> 21989.09s]  Got it.
[21989.09s -> 21998.12s]  Depends.
[21998.12s -> 22004.68s]  Yeah, I'm just trying to wonder like what people would want to watch or what people
[22004.68s -> 22008.58s]  would want to learn specifically cuz I know everybody plays different shit but I know there's
[22008.58s -> 22019.96s]  also like popular shit you know okay I'm just bad he's bad too we listen we're we're
[22019.96s -> 22075.69s]  bad we're bad guys we're not bad gin luchians I have failures damn is it like just that
[22075.69s -> 22082.12s]  different like a lot of people like different stuff because I've always just thought like
[22082.12s -> 22093.30s]  No, I guess I've always just thought that people like a
[22095.77s -> 22099.49s]  Lot of people really like like meta 80 carries or like really play makey 80 carries
[22099.49s -> 22102.49s]  Right like jinx is probably the best 80 carry in the meta
[22102.73s -> 22106.77s]  But I don't say a lot of people ever ask or like request to watch jinx
[22107.21s -> 22108.05s]  You know what I mean?
[22108.05s -> 22112.41s]  Like jinx is not like she's not like a fun 80 carry that people want to learn how to play even though
[22112.41s -> 22114.05s]  She is like the best ad
[22114.05s -> 22118.21s]  There's like the people who are like oh, you know jinx is boring like I want to play gin and like shoot people
[22118.21s -> 22121.97s]  I want to play like Lucian and dash around like it's like so that's what I'm wondering is like what the number one
[22122.29s -> 22124.29s]  AD carry is for like people just like enjoy watching
[22139.90s -> 22141.42s]  Not bad though
[22141.42s -> 22148.94s]  Okay, I think we could play an AD carry game. I'm down. I owe you guys an AD carry game. I
[22149.54s -> 22154.18s]  owe you that much for watching me play support for two hours. Actually, I think it was like two and a half hours
[22157.11s -> 22159.27s]  Yeah, we played four games of support. So it's like two hours
[22160.63s -> 22162.87s]  Yeah, I owe you guys for for that
[22162.87s -> 22174.86s]  Zaya or Vayne? Zaya is fun to watch. I do like Zaya. You love Jynx and Kate? Oh, there you go.
[22174.86s -> 22187.39s]  You're playing support top so you like to watch how AD carries play it? Ah. So that you can like
[22187.39s -> 22204.54s]  better help the homies. Got it, got it. We need eight wins I think from this point. We are
[22204.54s -> 22213.86s]  right now. I think it's eight wins to get to Grandmaster. I think. Oops. Because we're
[22213.86s -> 22221.30s]  what 370 something right like three set 360 no we just won we're not 360 we're
[22221.30s -> 22232.83s]  like 370 we're 387 okay so it's not updated but what is this stop so we
[22232.83s -> 22240.03s]  need what seven wins net wins to get to GM I think we can hit GM I'm a little
[22240.03s -> 22244.31s]  less confident right now about master or about challenger but I think we can
[22244.31s -> 22256.48s]  definitely had gym like I think I'll get stuck in gym for a bit unless unless the
[22256.48s -> 22265.54s]  games get higher quality I'll be stuck in gym for a little bit because the thing
[22265.54s -> 22270.22s]  about the thing about the games so far is like the higher quality the games get
[22270.22s -> 22274.90s]  the easier it actually is to carry if like if you're a decent player because
[22274.90s -> 22278.38s]  the better your teammates get which means that like if you're at that like
[22278.38s -> 22282.78s]  say like a challenger player will have a better time a challenger ad carry player carrying in
[22282.78s -> 22289.42s]  challenger if they get a lead then in diamond if they get a lead if if that like i know that sounds
[22289.42s -> 22293.34s]  weird to say but that's it's it's basically just because like when your teammates are better they
[22293.34s -> 22298.22s]  enable you better and ad carry and all those other roles when they're being enabled it's a lot easier
[22298.22s -> 22310.16s]  to play the game like if i were to first pick jinx in challenger m mr there's a good chance my
[22310.16s -> 22313.20s]  my teammates would pick stuff that like lets me play Jinx.
[22313.20s -> 22314.04s]  Right?
[22314.04s -> 22314.88s]  Not saying it would happen,
[22314.88s -> 22316.84s]  but there's like a chance that my teammates would pick something
[22316.84s -> 22319.20s]  that like they would pick like tanks
[22319.20s -> 22320.98s]  or frontliners or some shit, right?
[22320.98s -> 22322.20s]  Or like Lulu.
[22322.20s -> 22325.18s]  Whereas like if you're picking Jinx first picking like,
[22325.18s -> 22327.28s]  let's say you guys are gold average,
[22327.28s -> 22328.84s]  like your support might just literally pick
[22328.84s -> 22330.36s]  like first time Valkons or some shit
[22330.36s -> 22343.93s]  and you're like, well this sucks.
[22343.93s -> 22347.09s]  Dude, I swear every time I hear the end of this song,
[22347.09s -> 22349.17s]  does anybody know who Forest Within is?
[22349.17s -> 22355.53s]  I swear the guy talking at the end of this song sounds exactly like forced within
[22357.01s -> 22359.01s]  No joke listen to this listen to this
[22359.25s -> 22372.37s]  That that guy who was like saying it was DJ what I like that guy sounded exactly like I don't know why my brain does that
[22372.39s -> 22380.13s]  Homie sounded exactly like forced within I swear to God. It's actually like perfectly like if you told me that was him
[22380.13s -> 22392.19s]  I would immediately believe you this guy wants to join the discord. Oh, I'm nervous about this shit
[22392.51s -> 22398.99s]  It is my support though, so like maybe we could join the discord and
[22401.76s -> 22413.17s]  Like work together a bit, but I'm also nervous about joining discord calls with people on
[22414.29s -> 22423.44s]  Stream, oh, I don't know. I don't know if it's worth
[22424.20s -> 22430.26s]  Where would you put Ezreal on the tier list? I think Ezreal's a tier. I think he could be s tier for solo queue
[22430.52s -> 22433.52s]  But he's hard. He's really hard as well as one of the hardest 80s
[22433.52s -> 22440.30s]  so I would say he's like a tier right now if you're really good at is he is very
[22440.30s -> 22446.90s]  very very strong but he's also incredibly hard to play but he also is
[22446.90s -> 22456.82s]  not weak in the meta so I'd give him like strong a like above other a's she
[22456.82s -> 22460.02s]  focused on mage supports like Brand Zarath or engage like Blitz Nautilus
[22460.02s -> 22463.92s]  It depends on your elo and it depends on what you're doing.
[22463.92s -> 22474.42s]  I think engage supports and lower elo are bad, oh somebody dodged.
[22474.42s -> 22482.33s]  I think engage supports and lower elo are bad personally because I think that you can
[22482.33s -> 22487.29s]  be a really good engage player and it doesn't matter if your team just gets caught over
[22487.29s -> 22491.33s]  and over again or if you like make an engage and your team misplays, right?
[22491.33s -> 22497.45s]  So it's like if you want to play engage supports do it because they are better than other like
[22497.45s -> 22502.43s]  engage supports are better than mages but I think in solo queue mages are better to solo
[22502.43s -> 22506.35s]  carry so it just depends it depends on your elo and it depends on like what you're trying
[22506.35s -> 22510.51s]  to accomplish right because a lot of the time as a support player it's why I play
[22510.51s -> 22516.95s]  Senna right like I play Senna because I like being able to carry games as support that's
[22516.95s -> 22519.47s]  That's why I like that.
[22519.47s -> 22524.95s]  Whereas like if you're a, like if I, like I can play almost every support, right?
[22524.95s -> 22528.75s]  I can play Nautilus, I can play, I can play these supports, but the problem is, is like
[22528.75s -> 22532.95s]  I feel bad if like I get, like it feels really shitty to get people ahead and then have
[22532.95s -> 22536.47s]  them completely throw their leads over and over again and then tilt and range and shit.
[22536.47s -> 22538.31s]  So it feels like dog shits.
[22538.31s -> 22541.95s]  So it's nicer to just like give myself the opportunity to carry rather than
[22541.95s -> 22547.34s]  rely 100% on other people, you know?
[22547.34s -> 22549.34s]  I would say the number one thing is
[22550.18s -> 22552.18s]  Play what you think is fun
[22552.18s -> 22555.10s]  That's just the number one rule like playing if you want to win
[22555.34s -> 22556.70s]  You can play meta
[22556.70s -> 22561.26s]  But the problem is is if like you're shoving your face and I'm trying to learn a meta champ that you just don't enjoy the
[22561.26s -> 22566.70s]  Playstyle of you're never gonna actually be good at the at the champion because you're you're like it's like you're working
[22566.70s -> 22571.30s]  Right, but the best way to learn the champions and learn how to play the game is to have fun
[22571.50s -> 22573.70s]  Because you're not having fun at some point
[22573.70s -> 22578.66s]  You're not gonna be able to learn how to play because you're not gonna be able to put in the hours or put in the games
[22578.66s -> 22582.94s]  And I'd be focused during the game you're gonna be frustrated and if you're frustrated you're not gonna be learning
[22583.14s -> 22597.56s]  So I would say just play something that's fun. The fun aspect is gonna be way more important. Where'd my music go fuck?
[22597.82s -> 22614.16s]  I'm surprised. Can you guys even hear the music half the time? I have it on so low that I'm not even sure you guys can hear it
[22615.08s -> 22642.40s]  It's just like bear me background noise. Is this guy holding swap hostage?
[22644.16s -> 22646.88s]  Join call and I'll swap
[22653.39s -> 22656.03s]  Dude, he's holding swap hostage
[22656.63s -> 22671.54s]  By the way, if you guys do like the stream, don't forget to follow you can scroll down to see all my socials, too
[22672.06s -> 22674.90s]  Like tech talk Instagram all that crap
[22675.54s -> 22687.76s]  It's all below the stream. There's like links and shit and you know a
[22689.08s -> 22692.20s]  Man's gotta eat you can use a twitch prime too if you want, you know you're feeling it
[22692.48s -> 22708.54s]  I'm gonna do a kaisa game. He went lux
[22708.54s -> 22719.11s]  But I kind of want to play kaisa. What was the voice? This is what happens when I get close to the mic I
[22722.47s -> 22728.17s]  Should put the mic in front of my face more the mic's like over to the corner so the mic is like really badly directions
[22752.64s -> 22760.75s]  Says a cut down game there's Greg is always use AP he doesn't go tank. He goes like AP I
[22760.75s -> 22783.66s]  I kind of want to go last stands. That's fun. I should have taken Ghost. Ghost would have been so good this game.
[22788.67s -> 22795.58s]  Tread Kate with Shieldbow. It's strong. Yeah, it's fun, huh? I love Kate with Shieldbow. It's so fun.
[22796.40s -> 22798.40s]  This would have been such a good ghost game.
[22799.46s -> 22801.46s]  I'm frustrated. Oh, well.
[22802.96s -> 22817.12s]  I like wasn't paying attention. I always wonder if I should go...
[22818.00s -> 22820.00s]  Part of me always wants to go like
[22820.00s -> 22827.20s]  Uh, Long Sword 3 against Thresh and Zaya, but with Kaisa, I feel like you're on really
[22827.20s -> 22833.44s]  specific timers with Kaisa, so you have to go like, it's really important to go Doran
[22833.44s -> 22839.88s]  so that you can get the Q upgrade timer on the right, you know, like on the right timing.
[22839.88s -> 22843.64s]  I think getting the Q upgrade timer is just so big.
[22843.64s -> 22850.54s]  So this game, I feel like I go Bork this game, seconds, Bork or What's Ends.
[22850.54s -> 22854.32s]  If Gragas is not Ultra Fed, I'll probably go Bork, because I don't want to get What's
[22854.32s -> 22855.48s]  End just for Gragas.
[22855.48s -> 22884.32s]  Okay, he started Q, oh Diana's starting on Wolves, okay, I need to get some coffee
[22884.32s -> 22905.94s]  after this game, I'm getting drowsy.
[22905.94s -> 22908.30s]  I should have done the middle minion thing, I'm so bad.
[22908.30s -> 22917.24s]  Like I should have legitimately just done the thing with the minion.
[22917.24s -> 22920.48s]  So when you know Thresh starts hook, you can still play up, right?
[22920.48s -> 22940.19s]  I can play up, I can play aggressive.
[22940.19s -> 22942.15s]  I'm bad.
[22942.15s -> 22945.59s]  I should have just killed the Thresh.
[22945.59s -> 22946.59s]  This is really bad, man.
[22946.59s -> 22947.59s]  We can't help.
[22947.59s -> 22950.54s]  We can't help.
[22950.54s -> 22953.02s]  Because the wave, the way the wave is going, oh, I'm so bad.
[22953.02s -> 22956.09s]  I fucked up.
[22956.09s -> 22963.48s]  It should be fine, but I still, like, it fucks us over early game because they fucked
[22963.48s -> 22965.56s]  up very badly.
[22965.96s -> 22969.60s]  Like I can't stress enough how badly they just fucked up, but it didn't matter
[22971.24s -> 22972.44s]  Okay
[22972.44s -> 22974.44s]  That's that's happening apparently
[22975.52s -> 22979.68s]  Don't worry guys. I'm the best Ziya player or Kaisa player on the server. It's me
[22988.56s -> 23008.90s]  God, I am just literally playing like dog shits. I picked Kaisa. I just felt like playing her
[23009.38s -> 23016.67s]  We got a back. We have to leave the wave in a bad spot
[23017.55s -> 23031.22s]  Maybe she can push it, but like wukong's here soon. Yeah, we just okay. We got it. Nice. Not bad
[23032.22s -> 23035.54s]  So we had to push the wave in there so that the wave will bounce back
[23035.82s -> 23038.00s]  But we had to do it on a it was a really bad timer
[23038.38s -> 23042.46s]  Let me just say I fucked up the entire early game of this game like this games. I'm so bad
[23043.70s -> 23048.42s]  Essentially what should have happened was level one when they walked up when kaisen thresh walked up level one
[23048.62s -> 23051.02s]  We should have killed them like I should have just straight up
[23051.42s -> 23056.86s]  Hit the thresh with the locks because thresh walked into our wave because wukong was level 2 ganking
[23056.86s -> 23060.96s]  She just killed him. I grieved that and because I went for the Ziyah instead
[23060.96s -> 23063.98s]  I put myself in a spot where I took like 80% of my HP for free
[23064.42s -> 23070.86s]  Right, which put me behind and now the entire fight was like harder because I was low and then we had to wait for the way
[23070.86s -> 23072.86s]  It was just it was really bad
[23074.26s -> 23075.42s]  Really
[23075.42s -> 23083.51s]  That minion actually just did that. I don't think we can kill this guy
[23083.51s -> 23086.59s]  Unless she can max range land a Q or something, but yeah
[23086.59s -> 23093.88s]  Is Zarya the best lady right now?
[23093.88s -> 23096.80s]  Uh, no, I think Jinx is better.
[23096.80s -> 23097.80s]  I think Zarya's good.
[23097.80s -> 23102.64s]  Uh, her late game, especially with, like, paired with an agender, Zarya's insane.
[23102.64s -> 23105.68s]  But I think Jinx is, uh, better for solo queue.
[23105.68s -> 23106.68s]  Uh-oh.
[23106.68s -> 23113.94s]  I actually have to flash.
[23113.94s -> 23118.92s]  That was a good play hook by that guy, I disrespected him.
[23118.92s -> 23125.68s]  Mmm, I might have to leave, cause Wukong can just go here and dive me.
[23125.68s -> 23126.92s]  I actually just have to leave.
[23126.92s -> 23128.76s]  This feels so bad.
[23128.76s -> 23132.40s]  Do you see how Wukong just used the plants?
[23132.40s -> 23134.18s]  If I stay, I can just die, right?
[23134.18s -> 23136.56s]  So I'm just misplaying all over the place.
[23136.56s -> 23138.00s]  I'm taking too much damage.
[23138.00s -> 23140.20s]  We're playing weak side right now, right?
[23140.20s -> 23144.40s]  What I mean by that is like, we know our Diana's top and we know their Wukong's bot.
[23144.40s -> 23148.10s]  So because of that, I need to play a lot less trady.
[23148.10s -> 23151.52s]  Like I walked up and just let the Thresh fly me for free and I missed two waves now.
[23151.52s -> 23154.84s]  I need to not do that because if I don't miss these waves, it doesn't matter for
[23154.84s -> 23156.28s]  weak siding because I'm not behind.
[23156.28s -> 23158.28s]  It's it's just really stupid
[23158.72s -> 23166.86s]  Now what I do want to do is I want to go check and see if the wukong is like on our camps or something
[23166.98s -> 23177.40s]  Or if he's doing dragon or some shits. I should not have used the blast cone. Dude. I am so bad. I
[23178.40s -> 23180.40s]  Used the blast cone to just hit it
[23180.56s -> 23184.00s]  It's playing support man. It makes your it makes your brain smaller
[23185.56s -> 23211.86s]  Actually, like I swear playing support makes my brain smaller. Oh there in dragon
[23232.82s -> 23234.82s]  Ziya's trolling. I
[23234.82s -> 23235.82s]  I think.
[23235.82s -> 23239.97s]  I'm pretty sure I just freeze this, no?
[23239.97s -> 23245.61s]  With the Lux?
[23245.61s -> 23246.61s]  Yeah, she's just trolling.
[23246.61s -> 23248.11s]  I don't know what the fuck that was.
[23248.11s -> 23276.33s]  I took a little bit of damage, but she has to overextend now.
[23276.33s -> 23277.33s]  Not bad.
[23277.33s -> 23279.41s]  Okay, so, Zyah wanted to back.
[23279.41s -> 23282.45s]  The reason that I froze that was because Zyah wants to back, but she can't back until
[23282.45s -> 23284.45s]  we push the wave in.
[23284.45s -> 23285.89s]  Or until they push the wave in, right?
[23285.89s -> 23291.09s]  So it gives me time to kind of catch up on my back timer with Zyah, because I'm
[23291.09s -> 23301.93s]  a little bit behind in farm.
[23301.93s -> 23303.93s]  He's definitely gonna go mid here
[23304.13s -> 23307.13s]  He's either gonna go mid or he's gonna try and hook us from the bush. I
[23308.81s -> 23312.99s]  Think I'm gonna shoot my W through all of the bushes here. Okay thrashes and in the bushes
[23314.77s -> 23316.61s]  He's just Mia. Yeah, we don't know where he is
[23317.37s -> 23323.79s]  This is awkward because I can't really walk up. I mean, I guess I'm almost sick. So I guess I could walk up
[23325.39s -> 23333.92s]  Yeah, there he is. Okay, we see him. He is level five. So it's
[23334.72s -> 23338.56s]  We could probably actually fight like if this guy lands a binding I might be able to just trade I
[23345.56s -> 23356.59s]  Just I am I'm dead. I suck honestly. I needed it my bad. I'm playing bad
[23357.09s -> 23359.09s]  That's on me
[23359.29s -> 23361.41s]  The locks is playing so good. I needed a
[23362.69s -> 23366.27s]  W but then back up after the bind I've just I'm mechanically
[23366.89s -> 23369.49s]  Shitting on myself right now like out of my mouth. Just shit
[23370.05s -> 23376.45s]  Because I knew exactly what was gonna happen when I used W in front of the fucking thrashes face
[23376.45s -> 23378.69s]  So it's like here we go. You know what I'm in
[23379.93s -> 23385.41s]  Technically we're both six and he's five, but it doesn't matter because if I get hooked. I don't have enough damage. So
[23387.39s -> 23388.91s]  Now here
[23388.91s -> 23399.15s]  I'm gonna walk up and see if I can stop the Ziya's back. Maybe maybe she's backing in a weird spot
[23401.29s -> 23404.53s]  Yeah, we stopped their backs huge. Okay now they're in trouble
[23406.05s -> 23407.65s]  So
[23407.65s -> 23409.73s]  They really needed the back on that timer
[23411.01s -> 23413.01s]  Because they just want to fight right?
[23413.65s -> 23416.25s]  And because they just want to fight, they want to go back, right?
[23417.75s -> 23419.15s]  No way!
[23422.70s -> 23423.70s]  Dude, fuck off!
[23424.00s -> 23426.20s]  I cannot dodge a hook right now to save my fucking life.
[23427.30s -> 23428.50s]  Jesus Christ.
[23429.20s -> 23430.60s]  What is my movement, man?
[23433.73s -> 23435.33s]  Like, tilting myself right now.
[23442.65s -> 23445.45s]  I want to stay for this wave, but mid is Mia.
[23447.91s -> 23448.91s]  Yeah, I can't.
[23450.71s -> 23452.11s]  It feels so bad,
[23452.51s -> 23455.21s]  because I needed one more wave to get double pickaxe,
[23455.81s -> 23456.91s]  so I can get my upgrade.
[23457.41s -> 23461.29s]  Because like normally you go noon quiver pickaxe pickaxe and if you go noon pick pick
[23461.69s -> 23465.29s]  It gives you enough ad to get your Q upgrade right and that's like the whole point
[23465.29s -> 23468.45s]  You don't need cracking you see your Q upgrade because your Q upgrades when you start bursting
[23469.33s -> 23474.09s]  But because I got hooked under the turrets even though we got a kill I had to back and I couldn't get my timer
[23474.61s -> 23488.56s]  I'm so trash. I need some coffee. That's one of those men. I swear to God
[23489.48s -> 23491.48s]  Coffee is my savior. It'll save me
[23520.48s -> 23523.12s]  That wave actually just did that to me holy shit
[23524.40s -> 23539.90s]  We don't actually have to do anything here crazy nice well played
[23558.33s -> 23560.33s]  Nice nice nice
[23560.97s -> 23574.26s]  That was a good to be to I already got my Q upgrade now. We're chilling. Oh now. We're how much Ellen. Oh
[23575.66s -> 23577.42s]  Yeah, baby
[23577.42s -> 23583.55s]  You know what it is. It's like a
[23584.39s -> 23594.52s]  I'm playing the fights too quick. I just got to slow down and like think I'm like too hyped up. I
[23606.19s -> 23608.85s]  Really don't want to miss this wave. There's a person right there
[23609.03s -> 23615.73s]  oh shit let's go yeah he's dead okay I'm gonna go farm bot while that guy gets
[23615.73s -> 23633.86s]  that this locks is really good I kind of want to oh I can't get this play it
[23633.86s -> 23647.16s]  fuck what what that was BS okay you know I'll just take my entire HP bar
[23647.16s -> 23652.64s]  really quick on the turret it's not big deal guys I'm just I'm that good at the
[23652.64s -> 23655.96s]  game like I don't mean to brag but like you know professional gamer over
[23655.96s -> 23671.98s]  like you know I'm gonna be the one some lessons like I got you dude look how big
[23671.98s -> 23712.57s]  my shield is wait you son of a bitch I mean she's dead but I'll play it man
[23712.57s -> 23734.67s]  motherfucker all right they forfeit it nice well I need to make some coffee I'm
[23734.67s -> 23755.09s]  playing. Give me a sec. We're playing real bad. I need some coffee. Nice though we hit 400 LP.
[23755.09s -> 23773.73s]  Let's go. So now we just need 150 more. We need 550. I think 550 is GM. I didn't do anything that
[23773.73s -> 23779.89s]  game by the way. I did nothing. I could play another AD carry game. That was fun. I'm gonna
[23779.89s -> 23785.81s]  grab some coffee. I'll be right back. Talks amongst yourselves boys. I believe in you.
[23787.09s -> 23790.37s]  You can look at my AD carry tier list that we've been trying to figure out how to do
[23790.53s -> 23793.97s]  Enjoy. I'll be right here. Grab some coffee.
[23793.97s -> 23896.92s]  Oh. Fuckin' ass. Alright.
[23896.92s -> 23899.72s]  I'm back. Let's go.
[23899.72s -> 23904.56s]  The fuck? Sweet.
[23904.56s -> 23911.98s]  We back, boys. We back.
[23911.98s -> 23920.59s]  Time is at five. Ooh.
[23920.59s -> 23924.15s]  I could probably play for like another hour. And then
[23924.15s -> 23928.51s]  I gotta get off and make some dinner. Do some other shit.
[23928.51s -> 23942.10s]  you know I'm saying where were we oh yeah we're making the tierless yeah I
[23942.10s -> 23948.90s]  think Varus is really good a I think versus good a tier cuz um in my opinion
[23948.90s -> 23953.38s]  Varus is never really like a bad pick almost like sometimes he's bad but I
[23953.38s -> 23957.86s]  think he's just you can play him on hit or you can play him without he right
[23957.86s -> 23961.10s]  so he's got two builds that you can do based on the game in the team comp his
[23961.10s -> 23966.14s]  ulti is pretty much always useful like just having a stun like a root on a
[23966.14s -> 23969.82s]  champion is always going to be useful right then you have he's got very long
[23969.82s -> 23974.18s]  range like engage you can safely kill people with his ult and his Q you can
[23974.18s -> 23977.06s]  build him poke where like before objectives you can make picks really
[23977.06s -> 23981.10s]  easily you can poke people out before the objective get him low his lane phase is
[23981.10s -> 23984.14s]  really good if you're if you understand like how to play Varus his lane phase is
[23984.14s -> 23990.42s]  exceptional he also has in the meta currently I feel like he's just like a
[23990.42s -> 23994.54s]  good pick I don't think he's as good as Draven and Jinx for solo Q but I
[23994.54s -> 23998.82s]  I do think he's really good in general and you can you can climb with them really easily
[23999.70s -> 24002.14s]  And then I put ash here, too
[24002.94s -> 24005.38s]  Maybe ash. I don't know who I'd put in front
[24006.42s -> 24011.94s]  Ash or Varys. I think maybe ash or maybe Varys. I think ash is really underrated though
[24011.94s -> 24027.10s]  I think ash is super super good right now. I think ash is super good
[24027.98s -> 24029.46s]  because
[24029.46s -> 24031.46s]  Sorry, I'm trying to think
[24032.38s -> 24036.06s]  She's basically the same idea as Varys. She's a little different, but she's the same idea
[24036.54s -> 24042.14s]  She controls lane phase pretty well, rarely her lane isn't too bad.
[24042.14s -> 24047.24s]  She also has, like her R, always useful no matter what.
[24047.24s -> 24051.18s]  So like you'll always have use with Ashe, you'll always have use with Varus R, like they just
[24051.18s -> 24052.78s]  stuns, snares, etc.
[24052.78s -> 24054.28s]  So I'll look here.
[24054.28s -> 24057.02s]  She's also really good at being annoying in teamfights, like you can take Ghost on
[24057.02s -> 24061.42s]  Ashe and you can just Voli, sit outside their range and if you just basically solo
[24061.42s -> 24062.66s]  people.
[24062.66s -> 24064.50s]  And she actually has decent scaling on her crit now.
[24064.50s -> 24069.44s]  So you can go a bunch of builds too, like I think you can go Bork Ash, you can go Crack
[24069.44s -> 24073.56s]  and Slayer Ash into Bork, or you can go Crack and Slayer into IE, or you can go Crack and
[24073.56s -> 24078.06s]  Slayer into like, whatever, you can go Shieldbow Ash if they have tanks, you can go Gale
[24078.06s -> 24079.06s]  Force Ash.
[24079.06s -> 24082.02s]  Oh, you can just do a lot of different builds on Ash, and I think she's really versatile.
[24082.02s -> 24084.94s]  You can also just go the On Head build if you really want.
[24084.94s -> 24087.94s]  I think the Rageblade build sucks personally, I think that if I was gonna go On Head
[24087.94s -> 24092.34s]  I would just be like Shieldbow, Whitsend, and so like Bork or some shit if I was
[24092.34s -> 24096.32s]  I was actually gonna do that or she'll go pork or porklets or whatever, but
[24097.20s -> 24103.49s]  Yeah, I don't know Ezreal is probably a tier 2
[24104.93s -> 24107.25s]  I said Ezreal is relegated by like skill
[24107.85s -> 24112.05s]  So I don't want to put him in I think if you could play Ezreal perfectly
[24112.05s -> 24114.97s]  He'd be at the top of s like he would just be above Jinx
[24115.37s -> 24121.13s]  Just best champion in the game if you could if you could never miss a skill shot like a hundred percent accuracy playing perfect
[24121.13s -> 24125.05s]  like the champs insane, right? It's absolutely crazy how good that champ is if you can play
[24125.05s -> 24129.97s]  him perfect. But you're like, people are humans, etc. So I think he's like an A tier pick
[24129.97s -> 24133.41s]  in solo queue because you can get countered, like he's not blindable. You can get countered
[24133.41s -> 24138.81s]  pretty easily by good players. People play like push comps, people play dive comps, like
[24138.81s -> 24142.45s]  early game, I mean, in lane and shits, like, because Ezreal's lane is like, it's not
[24142.45s -> 24148.29s]  bad, but it's very difficult to play Ezreal well in lane. You got to be good mechanically.
[24148.29s -> 24152.09s]  I don't think even like I've seen like challenger players who can't play Ezreal, so
[24153.13s -> 24155.13s]  He's not easy
[24155.45s -> 24197.44s]  You know what I'm saying, what's up boys? So I was gonna be in kindred, but I couldn't find her I
[24198.92s -> 24228.58s]  Hate kindred. Yo, how we doing tonight? How's everybody's day? Okay, so this guy's picking Thresh again
[24229.30s -> 24261.98s]  Thresh into Recon Thresh is actually pretty good in the Recon. They have Xayah Thresh again
[24261.98s -> 24284.98s]  Let's play Jinx.
[24284.98s -> 24287.62s]  I like Jinx here.
[24287.62s -> 24290.50s]  Even though it is against Thresh, Jinx is a little scary, right?
[24290.50s -> 24299.54s]  But I kind of like her in this situation.
[24299.54s -> 24300.54s]  Let's see what runs.
[24300.54s -> 24301.54s]  Do I want free boots?
[24301.54s -> 24307.69s]  Nah, I think I want to be able to get early boots this game.
[24307.69s -> 24312.61s]  Because their team comp is like, oh yeah, their team comp is really, really annoying.
[24312.61s -> 24317.77s]  So I kind of want to get early boots.
[24317.77s -> 24321.79s]  I'll probably go present some mines.
[24321.79s -> 24327.48s]  Although I think Overheal isn't bad.
[24327.48s -> 24328.88s]  Actually, I'll go Overheal.
[24330.00s -> 24332.28s]  So, yeah, these runes look good.
[24332.28s -> 24333.88s]  Actually, let's do this.
[24335.52s -> 24336.36s]  Or this.
[24337.24s -> 24343.09s]  This.
[24343.09s -> 24343.93s]  Yeah, this is good.
[24343.93s -> 24344.97s]  Okay.
[24344.97s -> 24345.81s]  I kind of like these.
[24345.81s -> 24346.65s]  This is good.
[24346.65s -> 24347.49s]  I'm gonna use these.
[24347.49s -> 24348.37s]  Okay.
[24348.37s -> 24349.33s]  I'm taking clients this game
[24349.33s -> 24352.57s]  because they have Lissandra and Pantheon and Thresh,
[24352.57s -> 24353.41s]  right?
[24353.41s -> 24355.37s]  So, with Lissandra, Pantheon and Thresh,
[24356.15s -> 24361.07s]  the game's gonna be like really fast of like okay if they stun me I'm just gonna
[24361.07s -> 24365.43s]  get CC chained and I'm just gonna die like after a bit right it's gonna be
[24365.43s -> 24371.66s]  like a stun and they're starting to start and this I'm just gonna die so I'm
[24371.66s -> 24410.33s]  like nah fuck that shit let's see if we can get this w boys let's see if I can
[24410.33s -> 24418.89s]  not fuck up the first three levels the lane got chat restricted oh yeah it's
[24418.89s -> 24426.48s]  for a while it's right it's secret code to make it so I could actually play
[24426.48s -> 24454.01s]  the game and climb without chatting okay I should have warded this bush I was
[24454.01s -> 24456.91s]  drinking my coffee I didn't think about it but yeah if you guys are against the
[24456.91s -> 24465.37s]  hook champ always ward this bush right like right here you're gonna want to
[24465.37s -> 24470.97s]  ward here early against the most hook champions because it gives you a very
[24470.97s -> 24474.93s]  nice like they can't walk in here in cheese you they can't walk in here
[24474.93s -> 24506.82s]  and cheese you so you just don't get cheesed by anything I mean that's just I
[24506.82s -> 24514.34s]  don't even know what I just saw I'll be real I don't know what the fuck just
[24514.34s -> 24520.16s]  happened but okay trying to push this wave as fast as I can not sure I can
[24520.16s -> 24540.14s]  actually get it pushed fast enough but we're gonna try it was close no I'm
[24540.14s -> 24546.54s]  gonna let it just push it's not a huge deal it was very close though we can
[24546.54s -> 24552.92s]  just break the freeze right like it's not a huge deal are they supposed to
[24552.92s -> 24559.88s]  level one it depends I mean Ziyah is not that good level one like she Ziyah is good because she
[24559.88s -> 24564.12s]  has her feathers right but if you can't stack your feathers level one Jinx has more damage
[24564.92s -> 24570.20s]  and they stacked up for my gap or for my rockets so I got like I full stacked my lethal tempo and I
[24570.20s -> 24578.70s]  just double AoE rocketed them over and over and over and over again right and so when they finally
[24578.70s -> 24611.99s]  all in, they were just behind an HP. Also Thresh missed. He only had Flay. Damn. That
[24611.99s -> 24633.00s]  was so close, man. Like, actually. If Thresh had died there, or not Thresh, if Graves had
[24633.00s -> 24652.01s]  died there, we'd just win the game. Yeah, this isn't good. Oh, I'm gonna get Flay. I'm
[24652.01s -> 24657.79s]  dead. Maybe? Oh, maybe I'm not dead? I have to walk up like this. It was a really
[24657.79s -> 24663.23s]  bad fight by the what what am I watching what the fuck that was just a bad fight
[24663.23s -> 24668.99s]  because um we knew Graves was bot and we knew that he was gonna kill in the
[24668.99s -> 24674.29s]  jungle right so like my jungler already got outplayed by Graves once topside
[24674.29s -> 24678.07s]  you shouldn't ever take another fight like that botside you should just take
[24678.07s -> 24682.63s]  the win right like I rotated now granted the Rakan should have been
[24682.63s -> 24687.31s]  there to help kill the graves like when I rotated Rakan was still jacking
[24687.31s -> 24691.61s]  off and win right like when I was here Rakan was like way down here so the
[24691.61s -> 24696.55s]  support should have rotated first right like I rotated but the support should
[24696.55s -> 24699.75s]  have been the one rotating but again he's just a lot of the time you have
[24699.75s -> 24702.87s]  support players who don't understand timers and I had to help junk nobody
[24702.87s -> 24708.47s]  plays for jungle support players hate playing for jungle in low elo so it's
[24708.47s -> 24713.87s]  just not a thing so I tried to go over and help him but I misplaced my
[24713.87s -> 24721.91s]  traps a little bit and then the grave said a flash but he got away and they
[24721.91s -> 24726.67s]  tried to go in again when I was too low to actually help we just got lucky we
[24726.67s -> 24734.01s]  didn't lose the game off that shit kind of does suck those I was really strong
[24734.01s -> 24755.01s]  now not bad I should oh I should have I could have killed her I suppose I
[24755.01s -> 24761.32s]  could have killed the guy no joke I totally could have killed him if I
[24761.32s -> 24764.48s]  Warded the lantern as he tried to take it. I would have killed the Zaya
[24766.68s -> 24782.30s]  Because she ego'd the lantern there. She ego'd the lantern so hard if I had if I had warded it. She dies there
[24783.58s -> 24797.08s]  It's my bad this game is really interesting because
[24798.60s -> 24800.78s]  The enemy ball lanes actually misplaying a lot
[24801.68s -> 24806.20s]  like they're they're really really really misplaying these fights and trades and shit, but uh
[24807.16s -> 24809.16s]  We can't abuse it
[24809.16s -> 24813.10s]  because the Graves has so much control of the game right now
[24813.10s -> 24816.60s]  that we have to basically play safe permanently at the moment
[24816.60s -> 24820.40s]  and I can't do anything to help my team. It feels really bad.
[24820.40s -> 24838.52s]  Oh, my guys again? Yeah, there we are. See, little Graves is bought again, man.
[24838.52s -> 24855.40s]  This is so rough. Graves is mad. I want to kill this as fast as I can.
[24855.40s -> 24872.84s]  We can fight these guys 2v2, actually. Wait, why didn't he just go in?
[24872.84s -> 24886.02s]  I don't know why he didn't just W immediately. Like, the Recon waited.
[24886.02s -> 24891.86s]  Oh, that tilts me like when she was against the wall here. He should have immediately w'd her
[24894.22s -> 24895.50s]  because
[24895.50s -> 24898.90s]  If he W's from vision there, right and and she's against the wall
[24899.22s -> 24905.24s]  It helps us so much because then I can I can overlay my flame chomps on top of the I
[24905.78s -> 24908.50s]  Can overlay my flame chomps directly on top of the Zaya
[24909.18s -> 24912.52s]  Right as the fights happening rather than like having to
[24913.06s -> 24916.06s]  Work around the fight because thresh is in my face type shit, you know
[24916.06s -> 24922.96s]  So we're just we're honestly just losing because we're not pulling the trigger
[24922.96s -> 24931.32s]  fast enough and we can't play aggressive when we can pull the trigger right like
[24931.32s -> 24933.24s]  we're losing because we can't pull the trigger fast enough and when we can't
[24933.24s -> 24941.08s]  pull the trigger it's the wrong time we do this right now we get dragon the
[24941.08s -> 24956.42s]  bot lane back do we get dragon here I want to go I actually want to go with
[24956.42s -> 24963.96s]  the enemy bot lane didn't back okay they're trolling they lost an objective
[24963.96s -> 24967.40s]  for free here this is really good so the enemy bot lane we fight this by the
[24967.40s -> 24980.90s]  way we just we can just straight up fight that right there is how you lantern
[24980.90s -> 24993.18s]  how you've worn a lantern by the way oh I did that guy's so dirty oh I'm bad bye
[24993.18s -> 25005.67s]  guys I didn't know pantheon was Mia that was my bad I was like going I was
[25005.67s -> 25016.38s]  too happy with warding the lantern my bad I can't believe the enemy team
[25016.38s -> 25024.07s]  Greeted that hard though for gold. Oh, that's actually nuts to me
[25031.54s -> 25034.52s]  No, yeah, the the Ziyas egoing like crazy
[25036.04s -> 25041.52s]  The problem is I can't abuse it constantly because like obviously like I need teammates, right?
[25042.44s -> 25044.44s]  But I can kind of abuse it like
[25045.16s -> 25047.52s]  But it's much harder by yourself
[25048.44s -> 25055.11s]  Because as you can see like I'm not playing poorly, but we're getting like
[25056.07s -> 25057.91s]  We're getting shit on
[25057.91s -> 25077.41s]  Shit on's a bad word. We're getting like oh come on man
[25078.41s -> 25087.61s]  They misplayed that so badly, but Recon just ate the fucking
[25088.89s -> 25090.89s]  Whatever I'm not gonna blame Recon. It's fine
[25091.17s -> 25094.97s]  I'm so sad about that though. They misplayed that so incredibly badly
[25096.21s -> 25098.21s]  Like so badly
[25098.33s -> 25103.67s]  It was just that like Recon all into the thresh with his ultimate, but all he had to do there was
[25103.67s -> 25110.53s]  Uses e to come back to me and then play front to back afterward, but he's he sat there auto-wing the Thresh
[25111.45s -> 25115.93s]  But you don't need to auto him you just need to engage and then I can maybe play after it. I
[25120.27s -> 25126.58s]  Probably could have double killed them there, too. I kind of messed up my team wants out
[25127.94s -> 25130.94s]  It's not it's it's silly because the game's not even over
[25134.71s -> 25137.37s]  Like we actually can win this game so incredibly easily
[25137.37s -> 25143.13s]  So easily if we just play it correctly because their balling is really fucking bad
[25143.13s -> 25147.85s]  I didn't want to be mean, but I'll just be mean their balling is really fucking bad
[25155.32s -> 25157.16s]  Well, I'm dead
[25157.16s -> 25159.16s]  They're still bad
[25159.92s -> 25162.88s]  I'm just ego-ing that was my ego. I
[25165.06s -> 25167.06s]  Still stand by it. I still think they're bad
[25167.64s -> 25173.24s]  This is playing 1v3 mid the Thresh has not been mid one time. So it must be the top laner
[25178.83s -> 25181.47s]  I'm I am so frustrated right now with this game
[25185.74s -> 25192.78s]  Because I feel like we should have won so many all-ins that we didn't win barely like one like barely right like barely didn't win small ends
[25193.26s -> 25195.26s]  I thought we should have won all of them
[25196.86s -> 25200.70s]  Like they they didn't land like a good all-in once Thresh didn't land a single hook once
[25202.62s -> 25207.42s]  And this is my recon like he just tried to he just used his r to try and engage
[25213.20s -> 25215.52s]  I think nocturne is done mentally
[25219.19s -> 25221.19s]  Okay, so in games like this
[25223.09s -> 25249.23s]  Like this thrash is so bad. Oh, let's go, baby
[25250.67s -> 25255.42s]  Huge
[25255.42s -> 25257.42s]  That was so huge. Let's fucking go
[25275.10s -> 25280.92s]  Like I I'm gonna hit no at 15 because dude. I really don't want to lose to this thrash and asiah
[25282.52s -> 25286.52s]  Like this thrash is doing the most the most ego shit I've ever seen
[25287.60s -> 25292.68s]  And he's just getting away with shit like right there thrash walks up whiffs every spell
[25294.08s -> 25300.82s]  And expects to get away with that shit. No, no, no, we win these we win these trust give me let me cook let me cook I
[25301.74s -> 25303.74s]  See my team to let me cook a bit, you know
[25304.62s -> 25308.96s]  Like we had a bad early game had to play weak side. Let me cook. Let me cook
[25310.46s -> 25343.72s]  We are chilling
[25343.72s -> 25375.16s]  If I landed that that would have been sick the rest is top two we can kill this guy
[25375.64s -> 25385.28s]  Come on guys. Don't forfeit
[25385.32s -> 25387.68s]  Guys the game is winnable. Oh my god
[25387.68s -> 25392.68s]  Dude, the game is- how is the Rakan gonna forfeit?
[25392.68s -> 25402.61s]  Dude, that game is so winnable, it hurts.
[25402.61s -> 25407.76s]  Like, dude, really?
[25407.76s -> 25413.22s]  That actually is so infuriating.
[25413.22s -> 25415.22s]  That's so infuriating, man.
[25415.22s -> 25418.22s]  That game was so incredibly winnable.
[25418.22s -> 25421.85s]  Like, look at this.
[25421.85s -> 25424.85s]  I did more damage than every single player on the enemy team.
[25424.85s -> 25432.21s]  If my team just relaxed we win the game a thousand times over that game
[25432.85s -> 25434.85s]  Like the game is over
[25435.69s -> 25442.51s]  We have a recon a rumble and a wukong for me to sit and sit behinds and we saw how bad their bot lane was
[25442.51s -> 25449.19s]  Right. I have quen's for the only way they can kill me. Never man. Dude. I wish to God
[25449.19s -> 25455.09s]  I'm gonna report them all like these fuckers. I guarantee I get a notification. There's no way these people are not toxic
[25457.18s -> 25463.50s]  There's no way you in this like you just want out of the game after a fucking your team is just doing well
[25465.06s -> 25468.14s]  Nah, man the score is 10 to 14
[25469.26s -> 25471.26s]  10 to 14
[25472.14s -> 25475.90s]  You have a Fed 80 carry
[25481.14s -> 25485.46s]  Look at this dude. We forfeited we were down 2.5 K
[25488.18s -> 25492.76s]  We had a better scaling comp than them like we outscaled them
[25494.94s -> 25498.82s]  We have two dragons, we outscale them,
[25498.82s -> 25502.36s]  and we're down 2.5K.
[25502.36s -> 25506.46s]  And my team rage hits forfeit.
[25506.46s -> 25510.10s]  Oh my god, that's so gross.
[25510.10s -> 25518.06s]  That is so disgusting.
[25518.06s -> 25524.46s]  So disgusting.
[25524.46s -> 25528.90s]  Why am I in a game with this player?
[25528.90s -> 25533.46s]  I'm 412 LP Masters.
[25533.46s -> 25540.38s]  I was in a game just now with a 7 LP Masters jungler.
[25540.38s -> 25541.82s]  And he's not on a smurf.
[25541.82s -> 25545.70s]  This is not a smurf account.
[25545.70s -> 25549.61s]  Because last season this guy was D4.
[25549.61s -> 25551.53s]  So he's not on a smurf.
[25551.53s -> 25556.56s]  Why is this player in my game?
[25556.56s -> 25561.08s]  Why is this player in a 400 LP Master game?
[25561.08s -> 25562.20s]  Why?
[25562.20s -> 25569.89s]  Or rather why am I in a Diamond 1 game?
[25569.89s -> 25572.97s]  You can go to his previous games, he doesn't even have good MMR.
[25572.97s -> 25578.41s]  Like if you look at these games, they're all like 100-200 LP, right?
[25578.41s -> 25579.69s]  Why am I in this game?
[25579.69s -> 25583.37s]  Why did you put me in a game with this player?
[25583.37s -> 25585.57s]  Like this guy, I don't even care if he sucks.
[25585.57s -> 25590.29s]  I'm more frustrated at the fact that these players mental boom at the first sign of
[25590.29s -> 25591.29s]  any negativity.
[25591.29s -> 25593.09s]  Look at this.
[25593.09s -> 25594.21s]  They just give up.
[25594.21s -> 25598.05s]  First sign of anything negative, they go next.
[25598.05s -> 25602.45s]  Like I actually could have 1v9ed this game too, like actually, but I'm not allowed
[25602.45s -> 25607.97s]  to try and 1v9 because my team once out of the game had fucking 4 minutes or 15 minutes.
[25607.97s -> 25610.73s]  That sucks man.
[25610.73s -> 25612.49s]  The new system is trash.
[25612.49s -> 25618.53s]  Like I'm sorry but the 4-15 system is good sometimes.
[25618.53s -> 25622.37s]  They should have a requirement that you have to be losing by x amount of gold for it to
[25622.37s -> 25624.13s]  kick in.
[25624.13s -> 25626.09s]  That should be it.
[25626.09s -> 25627.81s]  They should have a requirement.
[25627.81s -> 25634.46s]  You have to be losing by 5k plus for it to work at 15.
[25634.46s -> 25640.66s]  There needs to be something where there's a requirement because people are so stupid
[25641.18s -> 25647.82s]  Right like that game was a hundred percent ours. We had two dragons. We're down 2,000 gold at at 16 minutes and
[25648.82s -> 25658.34s]  Wukong's three and one we were done four kills Wukong's three and one. I'm I'm I'm literally
[25659.22s -> 25661.22s]  insanely strong
[25661.22s -> 25665.46s]  Even though we got weak-sided. I'm still winning. We just 2v2'd them bot side of the map right way
[25665.46s -> 25667.46s]  We just wanted to be two
[25667.82s -> 25672.82s]  Rumble is just like, like, ah, sorry, I'm just mad, I'm mad.
[25672.82s -> 25680.82s]  Like, they need to require, they need to require something other than four people, like require four people and a gold lead or something.
[25680.82s -> 25689.24s]  Like, that's so cancer. That's so fucking frustrating, man.
[25689.24s -> 25692.24s]  Like, I can't believe how bad people's mentals are.
[25692.24s -> 25700.24s]  Like, the, okay, I get it. The Rumble and the, the Rumble and the Nocturne, I understand wanting to forfeit, okay?
[25700.24s -> 25703.44s]  Okay, they're having a bad game, they want out, they're raging, they need to get their frustration.
[25703.44s -> 25704.44s]  I get it.
[25704.44s -> 25713.02s]  But why are we forfeiting when Wukong is three and one?
[25713.02s -> 25717.82s]  I have seven of our KP, I'm the 80 carry, I'm very strong, I just got my Mythic.
[25717.82s -> 25720.10s]  We have two dragons.
[25720.10s -> 25724.38s]  And Rakan's forfeiting two, I don't know man.
[25724.38s -> 25733.22s]  Ah, that's just frustrating is all.
[25733.22s -> 25737.10s]  Like I'll be real, I carry this game every day of the week.
[25737.10s -> 25739.10s]  Like every day of the week I carry those
[25739.50s -> 25770.63s]  So apparently riot is doing something about smurfing though, and I can't wait until they do
[25772.09s -> 25776.37s]  This is actually a really good thing that I wanted this that I wanted to talk about earlier in the stream
[25776.37s -> 25777.65s]  But I forgot
[25777.65s -> 25783.29s]  Apparently riot is like doing something to make smurfing harder because like apparently smurfing is outrageous right now and
[25783.81s -> 25787.43s]  I kind of think that they need to stop this too
[25787.43s -> 25794.03s]  so there's a there's a thing you can do in solo queue right now where you can
[25794.03s -> 25800.41s]  make a new account and you can do it with somebody on different accounts on a
[25800.41s -> 25809.97s]  new account and your MMR doesn't actually get like lowered so if you win a
[25809.97s -> 25817.53s]  game let's say you win a game I think this is just him leveling the account
[25817.53s -> 25828.10s]  But let's say let's say you win a game and in that game, you do it with somebody in a lower MMR, right now when you do it in a lower MMR.
[25828.10s -> 25829.46s]  I don't know if this guy did this or not.
[25829.46s -> 25839.10s]  But when you do it with somebody in a lower MMR, your MMR is based on now the game thinks that you're in that MMR and you can do it in placements.
[25839.10s -> 25843.74s]  So in your very first games, for some reason, there's no MMR lock on placements.
[25843.74s -> 25851.02s]  So you can, in your placements, duo with somebody who's like bronze, right, and you can play
[25851.02s -> 25852.02s]  with them.
[25852.02s -> 25857.42s]  And then the game thinks you're still winning, so it keeps amplifying your MMR.
[25857.42s -> 25861.54s]  So I'm describing this really poorly, but essentially you can duo in lower elos, and
[25861.54s -> 25866.42s]  the game doesn't know your MMR belongs in that elo, because you're winning in that
[25866.42s -> 25867.42s]  elo.
[25867.42s -> 25870.38s]  The game can't figure that out for some reason, the algorithm.
[25870.38s -> 25877.42s]  So when they stopped duo queuing, it still inflated their MMR to where it would be if
[25877.42s -> 25879.30s]  they had solo queued.
[25879.30s -> 25881.90s]  Does that make sense?
[25881.90s -> 25886.22s]  So it basically says that they went 10-0 in their placements.
[25886.22s -> 25891.58s]  So now they're in Master Tier MMR from a brand new account.
[25891.58s -> 25899.43s]  So now those people are in D1 Masters MMR, but they won in gold.
[25899.43s -> 25911.61s]  I also don't think you smurfing should be so easily accessible like this guy's not a bad player per se
[25912.17s -> 25916.17s]  But I don't think he's a master tier player right like this guy's a rumble player on a new accounts
[25917.05s -> 25920.89s]  I I from that game alone the fact he gave up tells me he's not a good player
[25940.23s -> 25942.87s]  Dude i'm i'm a heavy advocator for like
[25943.67s -> 25945.67s]  Riot hat you have to attach
[25945.75s -> 25947.75s]  Like a verification to your accounts
[25947.75s -> 25953.87s]  I know Riot would never do that, but I'm a heavy advocate for having to attach verification
[25953.87s -> 25957.27s]  to play ranked.
[25957.27s -> 25961.86s]  I think it would be great, honestly.
[25961.86s -> 25975.21s]  I think it would help so much.
[25975.21s -> 25977.49s]  If you get your verified account banned, are you done for it?
[25977.49s -> 25978.49s]  Yeah.
[25978.49s -> 25981.17s]  You have to get a VPN to play, other than you would have to.
[25981.17s -> 25983.93s]  That's my point, though.
[25983.93s -> 25989.73s]  If you get your verified account banned, that account's done.
[25989.73s -> 26011.92s]  Well, like I said, I don't think Riot would ever do it because it's too extreme and I don't
[26011.92s -> 26014.02s]  think Riot has the balls to ever do that shit.
[26014.02s -> 26015.62s]  VPN is only $5.
[26015.62s -> 26020.02s]  Yeah, but dude, are you gonna tell me that you're gonna buy it?
[26020.02s -> 26023.70s]  People who get banned on accounts typically get banned consistently.
[26023.70s -> 26026.14s]  That's why they're making smurfs.
[26026.14s -> 26027.38s]  Right?
[26027.38s -> 26031.86s]  So you're telling me somebody's gonna be willing to pay $5 for a new phone number
[26031.86s -> 26033.86s]  verification or whatever
[26033.86s -> 26035.86s]  every time they have to make a new account
[26035.86s -> 26036.86s]  they're not
[26036.86s -> 26049.06s]  not you me
[26049.06s -> 26051.06s]  Lulu, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay
[26051.06s -> 26053.06s]  don't I have smurfs? Yeah, I do
[26054.06s -> 26056.06s]  and I stand by all my smurfs
[26056.06s -> 26058.06s]  should be attached to the same like
[26058.06s -> 26059.06s]  account
[26059.06s -> 26061.06s]  like if you make a smurf
[26061.06s -> 26062.06s]  okay
[26062.06s -> 26064.06s]  this is what I think should happen
[26064.06s -> 26066.06s]  you should be able to put all of your smurfs
[26066.06s -> 26068.06s]  on one account so you can
[26068.06s -> 26069.06s]  make smurfs
[26069.06s -> 26071.06s]  and you can add that smurf
[26071.06s -> 26076.90s]  verification to an account. But it kind of like battle.net. Does that make sense? You know how like
[26076.90s -> 26082.42s]  battle.net has all your accounts in the battle.net thing, but you can sign in to battle.net. I think
[26082.42s -> 26088.26s]  that the way to make it viable would be like, you could put all, if you didn't have a second phone
[26088.26s -> 26092.42s]  number or didn't want one, you could put smurfs up to like a limit. So you could have like three
[26092.42s -> 26096.26s]  smurfs or like two smurfs in your main account, right? So you could have like three total
[26096.26s -> 26101.46s]  accounts and you you would have to like you could add those to the same like omega
[26101.46s -> 26106.02s]  account right and that omega account could be your verified account now if any of
[26106.02s -> 26110.14s]  your accounts get punished on your omega account all of your accounts get
[26110.14s -> 26130.18s]  punished so if any of your accounts get punished all of them get punished like I
[26130.18s -> 26133.58s]  feel like that'd be a good play maybe I'm wrong but I feel like it would work
[26133.58s -> 26142.95s]  yeah what's up rush I cause you brush what's up RF what do I want to play
[26142.95s -> 26151.32s]  I don't know, I don't know what I want to do here, it's all ranged, okay.
[26151.32s -> 26156.92s]  I wish I didn't have cleanse, cleanse is so worthless this game, wait actually.
[26156.92s -> 26162.12s]  Cleans does nothing this game at all, I just down a sum, like maybe if the brand like
[26162.12s -> 26178.70s]  tries to flash stun me or some shit, but I'm just like down a summoner.
[26178.70s -> 26180.38s]  Alright boys
[26180.38s -> 26186.47s]  We got night blue three on our team. There's a throwback
[26247.69s -> 26258.36s]  Yeah, oh we got him. I'm not gonna lie. I kind of looked like I was scripting
[26260.10s -> 26264.06s]  That that movement like if I was watching the game, I'd be like what the fuck was that?
[26265.86s -> 26267.94s]  Like my movement was the real sauce
[26268.58s -> 26273.82s]  Well on that like that that all in right there. That's some there's some sus movement
[26305.55s -> 26308.67s]  We can gank these guys they have no oh there's gonna be a ward in here
[26311.23s -> 26320.94s]  These people have no flashes
[26321.62s -> 26324.78s]  Enemy bot lane has no flash. This should be just be a free kill honestly
[26326.14s -> 26329.98s]  We just let these guys push in they can't walk up and we just play for that
[26334.82s -> 26347.81s]  Even if they try and 3v3 we should just win the 3v3 because we're stronger. Oh, this guy's just dead. Yeah, it's I
[26358.42s -> 26360.42s]  Need level three. I
[26360.42s -> 26364.96s]  I kind of fucked my entire wave here
[26366.14s -> 26378.53s]  Yo, can we push? Is there any way we can just push this? Oh nice
[26389.62s -> 26391.62s]  Nice, well played
[26392.58s -> 26394.02s]  Nice job
[26394.02s -> 26396.46s]  My Lulu's fucking fetish shit. Oh
[26404.28s -> 26406.28s]  I should have gone free boots this game. I
[26407.12s -> 26409.12s]  didn't think about it
[26409.80s -> 26415.68s]  Cuz uh, I don't need Sork this game. You know how like the last game I told you I was going boots
[26415.68s -> 26417.68s]  I went boots for the
[26418.24s -> 26422.56s]  You know the fast boot to rush for Thresh. I don't need that this game because
[26423.44s -> 26425.68s]  We just went through like faster mythic
[26426.08s -> 26432.90s]  So I should have gone free boots for like more efficiency
[26439.96s -> 26443.56s]  Can't understand knock just kill a man
[26444.56s -> 26446.56s]  You can't understand
[26447.16s -> 26449.16s]  Just kill a man
[26449.36s -> 26470.91s]  I want to push this wave
[26470.99s -> 26472.99s]  So we don't get like shit on
[26500.25s -> 26502.25s]  Just kill a man
[26502.73s -> 26506.71s]  You can't understand just kill a man
[26510.97s -> 26514.77s]  Kill a man there is something you can't understand
[26516.05s -> 26544.29s]  Get a man
[26544.29s -> 26546.29s]  Hmm. I could go back here, but I
[26547.01s -> 26559.26s]  Don't see any reason to go back yet. I think I'm dead
[26564.32s -> 26569.38s]  Oh, I misplayed that that was actually really good by Lula cool downs. No, you're fine, man
[26569.38s -> 26573.76s]  I wish I could I wish I could tell him that he played it fine. I messed up not him
[26573.76s -> 26579.10s]  I messed up. I feel bad. I want to like say no you're fine
[26579.70s -> 26585.63s]  Because that was my bad. I
[26585.79s -> 26591.07s]  Should have okay, so when I flashed and I was running away from the twitch right the second that twitch flashed on me
[26591.07s -> 26593.07s]  I should have instantly started autoing him
[26593.23s -> 26598.51s]  Like I and it was one extra auto like one single extra auto and it would have been fine
[26599.03s -> 26603.46s]  Why can't I tell her?
[26603.46s -> 26607.92s]  You know, I just choose not to type anymore
[26608.72s -> 26612.78s]  It's my choice
[26612.78s -> 26615.41s]  You know
[26615.41s -> 26616.45s]  Yeah
[26616.45s -> 26646.37s]  My choice that guy's actually doing that, huh? Wow, we win to be two really fucking hard
[26647.69s -> 26649.69s]  Especially with tier two boots, but I need a
[26650.69s -> 26668.18s]  Dude, I'm doing some scripty shit. I don't be real
[26669.06s -> 26678.86s]  Dude Lulu wasn't six. I thought she was six. I'm so bad. I
[26681.76s -> 26685.24s]  Wish I could tell her my bad again. I'm actually trolling
[26686.16s -> 26689.88s]  like I ran out of mana because I'm bad and then I
[26691.12s -> 26699.04s]  And then I thought she was six so I walked up to like take tank deterrent for a second right because I was like
[26699.04s -> 26704.50s]  Oh shit, maybe I'll get like maybe we can kill this guy. Maybe Lulu has a spell or something. I just oh, I played bad my bad
[26710.60s -> 26712.16s]  W that make sure
[26712.16s -> 26721.47s]  Echo is not there. I feel I actually just feel so bad because the Lulu is actually playing really
[26721.47s -> 26723.47s]  It's like the best support I've had all day
[26723.51s -> 26725.51s]  Like this guy's actually impressing me, right?
[26725.87s -> 26727.87s]  Like this guy's playing really well
[26727.95s -> 26760.56s]  And I'm just griefing
[26760.56s -> 26765.60s]  Lulu gave her life for me.
[26765.60s -> 26767.60s]  Lulu gave her life for me, boys.
[26767.60s -> 26773.30s]  Can we get a salute for Lulu and chat, boys?
[26773.30s -> 26777.12s]  Can we get a salute?
[26777.12s -> 26779.12s]  Can we get some love for Lulu?
[26779.12s -> 26803.73s]  She gave her life for the homie.
[26803.73s -> 26807.73s]  Honestly, that was a really cool 2v2, by the way.
[26807.73s -> 26809.73s]  Oh, Nipah was smurfing it.
[26809.73s -> 26811.73s]  What the fuck?
[26811.73s -> 26829.63s]  Yo, kill that bitch, too.
[26829.63s -> 26840.37s]  Nice.
[26840.37s -> 26841.21s]  No!
[26841.21s -> 26842.03s]  Oh!
[26843.53s -> 26846.47s]  If I lost that cannon, I would have lost my life.
[26846.47s -> 26847.31s]  End game.
[26876.97s -> 26878.61s]  I'm gonna go BT second item.
[26878.61s -> 26881.85s]  We have Lulu, so wait, what the fuck is this pathing?
[26883.49s -> 26885.77s]  I clicked to go bot and it pats me in the weirdest spot ever.
[26885.77s -> 26888.57s]  We have Lulu, so I could actually go IE second,
[26888.57s -> 26891.65s]  but I think if I go BT, I'll be actually unkillable.
[26893.05s -> 26894.93s]  Like it'll be the greatest thing ever.
[26897.32s -> 26898.64s]  I actually still might go IE
[26898.64s -> 26899.80s]  as I'm thinking about it that loud
[26899.80s -> 26903.20s]  by saying we have Lulu and not be stupid, but hey.
[26903.20s -> 26905.68s]  Okay, I still might, you know, I still might go IE,
[26905.68s -> 26907.56s]  but I don't know yet, we'll see.
[26907.56s -> 26925.55s]  Cause I took a Lackardy, so it's like, wow.
[26925.55s -> 26948.52s]  No, I'm gonna die.
[26949.52s -> 26951.52s]  I mean, I don't know why I flashed away.
[26953.44s -> 26955.04s]  I'm playing bad.
[26955.04s -> 26956.00s]  That's my fault.
[26957.48s -> 26960.04s]  I think the game's over, so I'm just, I'm playing bad.
[26960.04s -> 26972.77s]  I'm like limit testing a little bit too much.
[26972.77s -> 26973.61s]  Today.
[26993.98s -> 27025.71s]  My blue haha
[27045.37s -> 27058.23s]  The price they haven't forfeited know what the fuck dude
[27058.73s -> 27062.89s]  How does this game Oh, I'm even more mad you guys have no idea
[27064.19s -> 27066.19s]  So I did
[27066.73s -> 27073.43s]  It's 24 to 8 the enemy team doesn't forfeit but my team for Fitz when the score is 10 to 14
[27073.43s -> 27075.59s]  14 and
[27075.59s -> 27096.25s]  We're only down a thousand golds. Sorry. I was
[27097.09s -> 27099.09s]  That was my bad. I was tilted by
[27099.89s -> 27105.48s]  You know, I was thinking about about how they weren't forfeiting and I was getting mad
[27106.96s -> 27111.66s]  It is a little interesting because I said they still can't win so I don't know who the fuck setting no
[27111.66s -> 27115.08s]  But it's probably echo. Well, no echoes definitely heading no, but like who else
[27115.08s -> 27132.66s]  maybe brands maybe ribbon ribbons like yeah they just get a thousand gold all
[27132.66s -> 27138.84s]  right I should probably stop trolling I'd feel pretty silly if we lost cuz I'm
[27138.84s -> 27142.96s]  bad after we like dumpster them and laying that art I feel pretty silly if
[27142.96s -> 27165.88s]  we lost cuz I keep getting caught all right I should be unkillable now like
[27165.88s -> 27169.72s]  I'm not even farming I'm actually griefing I should probably go make
[27169.72s -> 27172.72s]  dinner after this game I want to keep playing because I'm playing well
[27172.72s -> 27177.60s]  today but like dude my brain is starting to go like like I probably need to go make some food
[27178.40s -> 27196.05s]  I'm getting the full ADHD brain experience going so let's see if I can muster all my focus
[27200.67s -> 27205.47s]  let's see if I can muster up all my focus really quick just for push out and finish this game
[27209.81s -> 27214.29s]  we'll go terminator mode for the the end of this game right now we'll muster up all of the uh
[27214.29s -> 27278.03s]  all of the focus demon mode engaged boys god that was sounded really cringe I'm actually
[27278.03s -> 27285.06s]  really impressed though, Nightblue played this game really well. Like I'll be honest, my last
[27285.06s -> 27295.29s]  thought of Nightblue was him being bad at league. He played this game really well. My
[27295.29s -> 27305.84s]  man's gotten so much better. Okay, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that,
[27305.84s -> 27309.14s]  nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that,
[27309.14s -> 27313.22s]  nobody saw that, nobody saw that, not one of you saw me flash after the Echo Wall
[27313.22s -> 27326.34s]  not one of you wasted flash no that was assertive flash an assertive dominant
[27326.34s -> 27338.18s]  flash not wasted at all they might actually go for Baron here we should
[27338.18s -> 27350.66s]  look for this like they could try oh he's here pretty sure the ribbons here
[27350.66s -> 27357.82s]  too though yep I did not mean to do that I didn't mean to hit the thing I
[27357.82s -> 27362.78s]  accidentally hit the blast plants that was that was an accident it was a it was a literal
[27362.78s -> 27371.83s]  pure accident like I I did not mean to hit it I was like I know Riven's here I'm gonna
[27371.83s -> 27376.47s]  wait for Yasuo before I go over or before I do this right and I'm gonna bait him and

[27477.74s -> 27500.60s]  Like I'm actually so sad. I'm playing so bad
[27501.92s -> 27506.60s]  Like I was playing so good at the start and now I'm playing so bad that actually makes me sad. I
[27516.09s -> 27518.09s]  Was tanking for that guy
[27529.22s -> 27544.57s]  Let's just leave. I don't want to I don't want to throw the game for my my teammates because like I'm getting like you know
[27544.57s -> 27583.04s]  I've already died five times like a dipshit. Oh, where'd he go? We should just push bot honestly
[27584.66s -> 27596.10s]  We don't even need this dragon
[27596.10s -> 27598.10s]  Okay, we just I'm just gonna push bot
[27643.94s -> 27658.64s]  Not bad
[27658.64s -> 27663.32s]  Not bad at all. I got to give it to I want to give it to night blue, but I got to give it to this Lulu
[27664.32s -> 27671.33s]  Lulu played that game so good. I gotta give it to Lulu. She played so fucking good
[27671.33s -> 27722.45s]  like actually I don't even know if she's still in here I'm not a scripter she
[27722.45s -> 27760.06s]  thinks I'm a no I'm serious she thinks I'm a scripter bro I'm streaming the homie
[27760.06s -> 27776.75s]  thought I'm a scripter you know I'll take it my ego feels good honestly that
[27776.75s -> 27785.82s]  feels good that feels good hi well that was a script dude I'm not gonna lie
[27785.82s -> 27790.92s]  though some of those movements were sus as fuck that I was making like I was I
[27790.92s -> 27795.36s]  like I like turned on the fucking mental scripts for that game some of those
[27795.36s -> 27803.30s]  movements early were nuts like like just like this tiny little tiny little
[27803.30s -> 27807.46s]  movements I was doing early game and lame were crazy like look at this watch
[27807.46s -> 27818.03s]  this like this movement right here right like look I dodge that right then
[27818.03s -> 27829.84s]  walk up cleanse the thing kite down like that that movement is gross man look
[27832.42s -> 27839.62s]  that was actually some gross ass movement i'm not gonna lie look at this in the corner man
[27840.18s -> 27851.70s]  in the corner my brain was like you know andromeda thank you man yo you played really good
[27851.70s -> 27858.50s]  Now I felt bad. I felt so bad because I was griefing like I was like at the start of the game
[27858.50s -> 27861.78s]  We were just snow like I literally fucked up like three times
[27862.58s -> 27865.06s]  During like the really important fights, and I was like, oh no
[27870.26s -> 27871.70s]  Yeah, thank you the best
[27871.70s -> 27873.70s]  Can I play Calista? I can
[27878.11s -> 27882.03s]  I'm trying to figure out if I want to play a Calista game or if I want to go make dinner
[27888.99s -> 27893.31s]  There was one other movement that I thought was kind of nuts. I did a really good movement to
[27893.79s -> 27898.32s]  Somewhere I don't remember what it was
[27898.40s -> 27904.80s]  Here's where I fucked up. So right now, I should have just been, for some reason, my brain lagged,
[27904.80s -> 27909.84s]  and I should have just been sitting here, um, I should have just cleansed and then started fighting
[27909.84s -> 27915.28s]  the Twitch. For some reason, I didn't cleanse, but this wasn't like your fault at all. Like,
[27915.28s -> 27919.28s]  the second the Twitch flashed, I should have insta cleansed the ignite, and I should have
[27919.28s -> 27923.04s]  just been killing him, like right now, just like auto-ing, because I can't get away from him,
[27923.04s -> 27930.15s]  right but it took me an extra second see I I started fighting him now like I
[27930.15s -> 27935.55s]  barely died I wouldn't have died had I cleansed and had I just turned initially
[27935.55s -> 27945.18s]  it was fine and then like here I fucked up too because I went in and I thought
[27945.18s -> 27958.82s]  we were six oh I could have killed that guy I should have gone forward one more
[27958.82s -> 27962.14s]  oh you know what I should have done there I should have gone forward one
[27962.14s -> 27966.14s]  more auto killed this guy Lulu would have gotten six off of the kill I
[27966.14s -> 27970.70s]  I would have used my speed to come back out. Then she could have ulted me. We could have killed the uh
[27971.74s -> 27974.30s]  We could have got the twitch and then we could have turned on this echo too
[27981.72s -> 27984.12s]  Oh, this was a really cool 2v2
[27985.56s -> 27987.56s]  I actually thought this 2v2 was really sick
[27992.57s -> 27996.65s]  Lulu is a real one for this man. Listen. You're a real one for this one
[27997.53s -> 27999.53s]  You just took the death to save me
[28004.60s -> 28006.44s]  Respect
[28006.44s -> 28012.89s]  You're a real one for that
[28012.89s -> 28014.09s]  That was so good.
[28019.55s -> 28021.15s]  Jesus was fun. Yeah, GGs.
[28021.15s -> 28022.85s]  You were the best support I've had today.
[28023.25s -> 28026.25s]  Like, legitimately, you played better than all the other players in the SEALA.
[28026.55s -> 28027.55s]  That was really good.
[28027.75s -> 28029.85s]  Like, I was surprised. I was telling my stream, I was like, yeah.
[28030.05s -> 28032.15s]  She's actually, like, they...
[28032.45s -> 28034.35s]  I said cheek zero, I don't know, you know.
[28034.55s -> 28035.55s]  But I was like, yeah.
[28036.25s -> 28039.85s]  She's playing super good. She's playing way better than all of my fucking teammates.
[28044.58s -> 28045.28s]  Yo.
[28046.38s -> 28047.78s]  What time is it? It's six?
[28048.68s -> 28049.78s]  Man, do I wanna...
[28049.78s -> 28053.88s]  Do I want to keep streaming or do I want to go to or do I want to go get food and go to the gym?
[28053.88s -> 28059.12s]  I can't like 24 hour fitness is not actually 24 anymore
[28059.40s -> 28068.04s]  So I'd have to go soon if I'm gonna go to the gym, but it is only like six
[28078.01s -> 28079.21s]  hmm
[28079.21s -> 28083.30s]  But I could just end on I
[28084.18s -> 28088.42s]  Could just end on the hitting the like 400 LP mark and just chill for now
[28091.19s -> 28093.97s]  Right like we had 400 LP. We'll probably hit GM tomorrow
[28093.97s -> 28098.41s]  So I could just chill for now, and then we can just hit GM tomorrow
[28101.09s -> 28108.01s]  That's probably a better idea because then I won't get mad like say say we get like like say we get another game like this, right?
[28109.37s -> 28114.33s]  Like say we get another game like this where like we're literally winning the game and my team's like no
[28114.33s -> 28118.21s]  Let's forfeit like that's gonna make me mad. I was mad. This is gonna make me mad, right like I
[28118.81s -> 28123.21s]  So I'd rather just like get off on a good note like a happy note. You know like not be tilted
[28123.21s -> 28136.32s]  I think I can get Challenger back this year, but we gotta get to GM first.
[28136.32s -> 28140.32s]  I'm telling you, this elo is so miserable.
[28140.32s -> 28149.98s]  Master Tier is the worst elo I've ever played in my 12 years of playing this game.
[28149.98s -> 28157.68s]  Whatever NA 300, 400 LP Masters is literally disgusting.
[28157.68s -> 28159.80s]  These are not real people.
[28159.80s -> 28167.72s]  I feel like half of these games we are playing with NPCs who quite literally don't even, like
[28167.72s -> 28172.14s]  I don't even know what to say, they're bots and they can't be real humans.
[28172.14s -> 28177.64s]  They get mad over nothing, they rage quit over nothing, they give up at 15 minutes when
[28177.64s -> 28179.52s]  we're winning the game.
[28179.52s -> 28182.99s]  These cannot be real people.
[28182.99s -> 28187.43s]  So I swear to God the game has to get better in GM.
[28187.43s -> 28189.29s]  It has to get better.
[28189.29s -> 28193.41s]  There's no world that it gets worse.
[28193.41s -> 28203.02s]  Like I refuse to believe that because this is the worst grind I've ever had.
[28203.02s -> 28206.89s]  Is it bad to be a bot?
[28206.89s -> 28207.89s]  Are you saying I'm bot-est?
[28207.89s -> 28213.38s]  Are you gonna cancel me because I don't like bots?
[28213.38s -> 28214.38s]  I said it.
[28214.38s -> 28215.38s]  I'm saying it.
[28215.38s -> 28216.38s]  I don't like fucking bots.
[28216.38s -> 28217.38s]  Whoa.
[28217.38s -> 28219.10s]  Okay, I didn't need to add fuck.
[28219.10s -> 28220.10s]  You know what?
[28220.10s -> 28221.10s]  I'm gonna get off.
[28221.10s -> 28222.10s]  Yeah, that's it.
[28222.10s -> 28223.10s]  That's it for me.
[28223.10s -> 28228.66s]  I'm gonna get off of us. I'm tired. I need to go to the gym before I run out of juice make some dinner
[28228.66s -> 28234.46s]  I will be live tomorrow same time as today. I've been starting my stream at 10 a.m. My time
[28235.50s -> 28240.90s]  Maybe I'll do it tomorrow at 9 a.m. I don't know. It's 10 or 9 one between there
[28240.90s -> 28242.90s]  I always start my stream and so
[28243.42s -> 28247.06s]  And that's my time. So it's like seven eight nine PST
[28247.82s -> 28251.62s]  You're good at it. Thanks, man. I think I suck my goal is
[28251.62s -> 28258.42s]  hopefully I can get Challenger back and then I'm not gonna play like I just
[28258.42s -> 28262.98s]  want to my goal is Challenger so that I can prove to myself it's a really
[28262.98s -> 28266.86s]  stupid thing but I want to prove to myself that I can still do it at 32
[28266.86s -> 28270.34s]  because ten years ago was the first time I started streaming this year
[28270.34s -> 28273.62s]  right I've been streaming for ten years this year and so I want to get
[28273.62s -> 28277.54s]  Challenger because when I first started streaming I was in Challenger and I
[28277.54s -> 28282.90s]  want to see if like after ten years I can still do it and then I'm never
[28282.90s -> 28286.76s]  gonna care again this will be the only time I ever give a shit about getting
[28286.76s -> 28291.90s]  challenger I just want to get it see if I care and then play for content you know
[28291.90s -> 28298.26s]  but uh yeah it's just it's like welcome to the league of Draven see if the old
[28298.26s -> 28303.50s]  man who has fucking arthritis and fucking carpal tunnel and all that shit you
[28303.50s -> 28308.70s]  know what I mean see if I still do it yo thank you for the twitch prime man
[28308.70s -> 28311.32s]  I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Appreciate it a lot, dude.
[28311.82s -> 28317.70s]  Alright guys, that's gonna be it for me. If you like to stream, don't forget to follow all my socials and TikTok and Facebook and Instagram and all that shits.
[28317.70s -> 28320.82s]  All the clickable garbage is underneath the stream. Don't forget to check it out.
[28322.06s -> 28324.56s]  I'll be back tomorrow, same time in the morning.
[28325.78s -> 28328.98s]  Tomorrow's my last day. For the weekend though, I'm not gonna stream on Saturday.
[28328.98s -> 28333.06s]  I might do some off-stream grinding on Saturday. I've been taking...
[28333.06s -> 28338.22s]  I've been like forcing myself to take a day off of streaming every week just so like I can mentally recharge.
[28338.70s -> 28345.74s]  I think it's actually been really good for my stream because like I've been in a much better mood while streaming and I've been much less tilted and I've been
[28346.76s -> 28350.94s]  Even if I play league off stream or whatever. It's just like it doesn't feel as forced
[28350.94s -> 28355.88s]  So I feel like the brakes nice. So yeah tomorrow no stream on Saturday tomorrow for sure and Sunday
[28355.88s -> 28361.14s]  I might I might do a short stream, but yeah, I'll see you guys then. Thanks for watching. I appreciate you guys
[28361.78s -> 28370.72s]  And yeah, that's it. I'm gonna go make dinner. Oh, we guys have a good night day wherever the fuck you are
[28370.72s -> 28375.46s]  Later dudes. Hope you guys have a good one. It was fun playing with the Andromeda.
[28375.46s -> 28380.92s]  Go look on the games. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Peace!
