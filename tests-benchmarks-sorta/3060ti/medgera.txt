[190.19s -> 195.62s]  That guy has
[195.78s -> 207.54s]  GP
[207.54s -> 215.50s]  bees
[215.50s -> 254.09s]  Jesus
[254.09s -> 270.77s]  Yo, hey, what's up, man? What's up, dudes?
[318.94s -> 327.09s]  Yeah, I mean we're hoping we'll see you man. We'll see
[330.25s -> 390.83s]  Fingers fucking crossed right? Do I ever actually?
[392.15s -> 408.13s]  I'm wondering if I I'm assuming I'm just playing a math
[408.65s -> 463.22s]  No way. Hey
[463.70s -> 484.14s]  Yeah, this is probably just me doing fucking I'm probably just doing Star Guardian
[498.34s -> 502.54s]  Welcome to the y'all except for I'm dreaming for the 27 months man. You're ah
[503.50s -> 530.98s]  Appreciate it a lot, dude. Thank you, and I could probably still go infinite team, but so I'm holding the solution
[531.72s -> 533.72s]  But I haven't seen any servers or anything
[534.80s -> 619.95s]  So I'd be kind of awkward, you know, this guy's definitely gonna beat me that guy's I
[621.03s -> 625.17s]  See why he hasn't lost. That's his five infinity team already. Jesus Christ. I
[626.27s -> 628.95s]  Was like man, why is that guy so strong and then I like realized
[629.55s -> 780.80s]  So I go to seven next rounds and then hopefully we can hit
[782.12s -> 806.36s]  Some shit. I kind of like this actually because now we can make I
[807.64s -> 809.24s]  can actually make a
[809.24s -> 811.24s]  Guard breaker and I could also make
[811.76s -> 848.96s]  We go a guard breaker and math. I kind of want to just ionic spark, but I don't know if I should I need
[850.32s -> 852.32s]  an echo a
[852.40s -> 854.40s]  Niko or a rail
[854.40s -> 857.40s]  I also could use an Ezreal. I need like a quick draw.
[858.90s -> 860.90s]  I should have kept that Lucian from earlier.
[876.02s -> 880.02s]  This guy has a level 3 Blitzcrank and he's just so fucking strong it's stupid.
[949.42s -> 950.92s]  This is really interesting.
[956.06s -> 958.06s]  I guess I could go Spellslinger as well.
[975.23s -> 978.23s]  Then we just give the Shiv to TF.
[1006.48s -> 1007.98s]  We can just do this for now too.
[1035.71s -> 1037.21s]  I guess I could use...
[1040.68s -> 1042.18s]  I could do Jeweled Gauntlet.
[1044.00s -> 1047.01s]  I don't know.
[1047.51s -> 1050.01s]  Could Jeweled Gauntlet this shit up? See how it goes.
[1103.73s -> 1108.41s]  I need to like throw an item down, but I feel like morelos is bad.
[1110.94s -> 1120.12s]  I guess I could just use hat or like I said before, jeweled gauntlet could be good.
[1128.06s -> 1148.36s]  I don't know. I could just roll on seven to try and three star stuff.
[1152.74s -> 1156.02s]  This guy has three Kaisas though. This guy has one Kaisa.
[1159.66s -> 1162.26s]  Kind of hard to three star Kaisa. I could three star Nyla.
[1190.70s -> 1193.38s]  They got some eight with fucking 20 gold.
[1193.38s -> 1198.22s]  Here he has MF.
[1198.22s -> 1297.79s]  And dude, Blitzcrank's insane.
[1297.79s -> 1357.52s]  Dude, that Gnar just murked me.
[1357.52s -> 1371.58s]  I did not position for the Gnar and I got fucked for it.
[1371.58s -> 1399.18s]  This motherfucker.
[1399.18s -> 1404.22s]  Dude, I wish I could get some thick frontline leveled up.
[1404.22s -> 1458.67s]  That'd be cool.
[1458.67s -> 1542.31s]  Oh my god, another Gnar.
[1542.31s -> 1543.83s]  Well, RIP.
[1543.83s -> 1546.43s]  I was gonna go MF and then I decided to go Niko
[1546.43s -> 1548.27s]  and then I just fucked it all up.
[1548.27s -> 1551.41s]  Oh well.
[1551.41s -> 1571.54s]  Oh well.
[1571.54s -> 1572.62s]  What time is it, 10?
[1597.78s -> 1598.62s]  Oh.
[1619.19s -> 1621.07s]  What's up, boys?
[1621.07s -> 1634.70s]  How's everybody doing?
[1634.70s -> 1643.42s]  Oh, I'll be right back.
[1643.42s -> 1644.26s]  Sorry, I'm still waking up.
[1644.26s -> 1645.70s]  Let me, give me one sec.
[1645.70s -> 1647.70s]  Sup Sky?
[1647.70s -> 1649.70s]  Oh
[1649.70s -> 1675.98s]  Okay
[1675.98s -> 1679.68s]  Woo
[1679.68s -> 1681.68s]  Oh yeah baby
[1681.68s -> 1683.68s]  I was gonna play on my main at the start but dude
[1683.68s -> 1685.68s]  I don't know if I can sit through 8 minute queue times
[1685.68s -> 1687.68s]  To get people raging at each other all day
[1687.68s -> 1689.68s]  So we'll uh, we'll do some warm up on this account
[1689.68s -> 1703.10s]  For a bit
[1703.10s -> 1705.10s]  What a Mars's account
[1705.10s -> 1713.86s]  Like D1 Lowmaster
[1713.86s -> 1715.86s]  Like my other account's like 500
[1715.86s -> 1717.86s]  This one's, I wanna say like
[1717.86s -> 1722.26s]  I don't know, the MMR is really awkward when you get like low masters, right?
[1722.26s -> 1723.94s]  Like the MMR is super awkward.
[1723.94s -> 1726.54s]  So I don't know what the MMR is, but I know it's low masters.
[1726.54s -> 1727.94s]  So like sometimes there's diamonds.
[1727.94s -> 1729.98s]  Sometimes there's like 100 LP players.
[1731.30s -> 1737.40s]  Somewhere between there.
[1737.40s -> 1743.24s]  Dude, I I played some games off stream yesterday.
[1743.28s -> 1746.08s]  I got up to like 400 LP.
[1746.08s -> 1748.36s]  Then I lost three in a row.
[1748.36s -> 1755.54s]  That shit was painful.
[1755.54s -> 1759.22s]  I did into one of Tenacity's games, though, so that was fun.
[1759.62s -> 1773.46s]  That felt bad. No, yeah straight up. It felt so bad. He was doing so good, too
[1773.50s -> 1776.94s]  Like I straight up just had a bad game and I felt I felt like shit
[1779.41s -> 1782.09s]  Look at this shit. I just dropped like eight deaths. Look at the shits
[1785.05s -> 1787.93s]  Like he was just straight-up smurfing on the enemy top laner
[1788.65s -> 1793.21s]  And we all the entire team just like decided to collectively run it down
[1793.73s -> 1805.06s]  Like we all just got shit on this was a really weird game because I feel like
[1808.17s -> 1814.41s]  That game was like the first game. I felt everybody in the game was like actually high GM challenger, but they weren't right at that
[1814.93s -> 1831.78s]  There's a very weird system going on. Let's do a Cassiopeia game. Like I'll show you guys what I mean in a second
[1832.02s -> 1845.39s]  I'm assuming I should go this right? This is probably good
[1846.19s -> 1847.99s]  or this
[1847.99s -> 1857.46s]  That's probably good, too. Oh, well, okay. So yeah, we'll get this stuff
[1857.46s -> 1867.70s]  I don't even know who the fuck this guy was.
[1867.70s -> 1874.74s]  Some random Senna player who's like not playing Senna now and then this guy was like trying
[1874.74s -> 1878.10s]  to jungle and just like running it down.
[1878.10s -> 1883.26s]  It was I don't even know it was the weirdest game that I've played in a while.
[1883.26s -> 1886.82s]  Because like my AD carry wasn't bad.
[1886.82s -> 1890.82s]  Like this guy is clearly like on a smurf, but I don't know how good he was because he wasn't bad at the game.
[1892.52s -> 1894.22s]  The enemy AD carry wasn't bad.
[1895.52s -> 1897.02s]  This guy's also on a smurf.
[1897.72s -> 1898.92s]  It was the weirdest lobby.
[1898.92s -> 1904.52s]  It was like a bunch of smurf accounts all playing with each other, but it was like a non-smurf queue.
[1908.45s -> 1910.05s]  This guy was like the only non-smurf.
[1912.47s -> 1913.27s]  It was interesting.
[1923.03s -> 1925.23s]  Ooh, do I take Ghost here or do I just...
[1926.13s -> 1930.03s]  I feel like Ghost could be really OP versus their team with Cassiopeia,
[1930.03s -> 1939.50s]  Maybe I should just take I'm gonna try it. Oh
[1940.54s -> 1946.68s]  Somebody dodged cuz yeah, I don't know. I never know. I don't know if I should take ghost ignite whatever
[1948.52s -> 1954.64s]  Cuz I feel like ghost with Casio's feels like the same thing as AD carry right same idea where it feels really OP
[1955.20s -> 1974.66s]  Dude, there's so much drama going on in the league community yet again, by the way, like it's it's insane
[1994.56s -> 1996.56s]  Yeah, I don't know man. I
[1997.84s -> 2001.28s]  Just I'm
[2005.12s -> 2012.16s]  I like I like looking at drama because like drama is juicy like I like looking at drama but it's also like
[2015.42s -> 2033.80s]  How are people so stupid?
[2033.80s -> 2035.80s]  Yeah, i'm getting like I
[2036.44s -> 2039.48s]  I don't know man. My view on all of this shit is like
[2041.48s -> 2043.80s]  I I guess i'm just not hardwired that way
[2044.36s -> 2049.40s]  I I can't mentally wrap my head around being like excited to flirt with underage girls
[2050.28s -> 2055.10s]  or like when like
[2055.10s -> 2057.50s]  I just I i've never like had the want
[2061.13s -> 2067.77s]  like it happens so much between like league streamers and non-like just it's not even a
[2067.77s -> 2070.01s]  league thing it's just that we're in the league community right so you see it more
[2070.97s -> 2077.29s]  dude like well the the drama is like uh a decent-sized league streamer who is like
[2077.29s -> 2081.85s]  getting bigger or whatever like the ad carry streamer cookie or whatever he was like
[2081.85s -> 2094.06s]  Like, somebody made a 90 page, 90 pages of Google Doc to basically like expose this guy
[2094.06s -> 2100.34s]  for like, talking a bunch like sexually to underage girls, not paying his fucking like
[2100.34s -> 2116.66s]  mods who do work for him and like other stuff and I'm like, dude, how man, like
[2116.66s -> 2119.16s]  just be a normal human.
[2119.16s -> 2120.90s]  It's not that bad.
[2120.90s -> 2125.34s]  I take it from me being a normal dude. It's not that bad
[2200.23s -> 2202.23s]  Sorry, I was distracted. No, uh
[2202.75s -> 2208.15s]  Yeah, I don't know man. I I swear to God people are just stupid as fuck people were idiots
[2210.11s -> 2215.55s]  There's got to be some psychological underlying issue with people's brains not working but it is what it is
[2216.23s -> 2221.26s]  Huh? I've had this bark on account for a while
[2221.26s -> 2236.82s]  oh dude what is that taric skin you see this look at this taric skin man he's
[2236.82s -> 2256.90s]  fabulous good day my man's just straight-up fabulous people were
[2256.90s -> 2261.22s]  desperate I just can't like I don't think like I've been in the situation
[2261.22s -> 2265.78s]  where I was like a really really big streamer like much bigger than he is
[2265.78s -> 2269.68s]  And I got like I this is what I'm saying. It's like I understand
[2271.72s -> 2276.58s]  Like all of the crap that gets thrown at you like people will literally message you for no reason
[2276.78s -> 2281.48s]  Like you do have like fans that have like when I was at my biggest point
[2281.48s -> 2284.80s]  Like you you have fans that are younger girls guy
[2284.80s -> 2288.76s]  It doesn't matter and like you just got a like I just never in my mind
[2288.76s -> 2290.90s]  I guess thought like oh, I'm gonna flirt with these people like
[2290.90s -> 2296.24s]  It made me like I don't even I wouldn't even I literally didn't even see them as like sexual
[2297.02s -> 2302.55s]  in my brain
[2302.55s -> 2311.04s]  Like it blows my mind and then the fact that like if you like if you look at the Google Doc or whatever
[2311.92s -> 2316.28s]  The fact that like taco like I keep a taco whatever it was literally talking to him
[2316.68s -> 2320.16s]  Telling him he was doing it like what he was doing was wrong. He was like, yeah, I get it, right?
[2320.68s -> 2322.68s]  Then he did it again
[2333.06s -> 2336.30s]  dude the set ulting the pussy that that
[2337.26s -> 2340.34s]  I'll be honest that may be one of the funniest lines I've ever heard
[2355.02s -> 2361.80s]  Like dude, I mean whatever, you know, I'm not here to kink shame whatever gets people off, you know, maybe maybe maybe that's a fetish
[2361.80s -> 2388.99s]  I don't know
[2394.89s -> 2399.66s]  Safe and sounds either way
[2401.04s -> 2403.04s]  Don't worry. We cannot talk about the drama real quick
[2403.04s -> 2426.71s]  We can talk about how old and washed up Wings of Death is though.
[2426.71s -> 2427.71s]  I'm kidding.
[2427.71s -> 2436.43s]  Yo, did you see on a lighter note though, did you see Riot?
[2436.43s -> 2439.73s]  There was like a Reddit thread or something where Riot was saying that they're like
[2439.73s -> 2444.77s]  gonna try and do something about smurfing in the next few months.
[2444.77s -> 2458.33s]  I don't know what that means, but can you tell us something involving Wings just
[2458.33s -> 2459.33s]  between us?
[2459.33s -> 2460.77s]  Yeah, yeah, just between us and all the homies.
[2460.77s -> 2461.77s]  Yeah, yeah, in chat.
[2461.77s -> 2463.77s]  Nobody else say anything. It's fine. Yeah, no
[2467.26s -> 2480.14s]  What's up? My chat ain't snitches
[2480.70s -> 2503.46s]  When I was a teen, I made a montage of him having breakdowns in my games. Oh my god
[2504.22s -> 2506.22s]  That's amazing. Oh
[2510.38s -> 2517.10s]  My god, that's amazing. I feel like I need to pay you to see this montage
[2518.14s -> 2520.14s]  Like I will give you money
[2521.38s -> 2546.93s]  Okay, I need this this is important to me. Oh, I have dude you should see that
[2546.93s -> 2549.73s]  I I have so many rage compilations about me. It's crazy
[2550.65s -> 2567.35s]  So many I had a I had a villain arc for sure. I feel you just comes with like being a league streamer
[2567.87s -> 2581.86s]  But you players are not all mentally healthy. Let me let me tell you take it from me
[2582.38s -> 2591.85s]  Chad, okay. I'd like to think I'm not a villain anymore
[2592.81s -> 2607.74s]  Fuck you. I really want this plate
[2609.22s -> 2626.42s]  Nice dude anivia's roaming. Why is there Wukong just sitting top by the way?
[2626.42s -> 2643.78s]  That's actually hilarious, you know, it's interesting.
[2643.78s -> 2646.98s]  I feel like Tariq actually missed that stun.
[2646.98s -> 2671.98s]  I was kind of side-eyeing that, but I feel like he missed that stun somehow.
[2671.98s -> 2675.14s]  I feel like this is the easiest game I've ever played, by the way.
[2675.14s -> 2679.98s]  I'm on full autopilot, brain still waking up, and I feel like they're just walking
[2679.98s -> 2680.98s]  into me on repeat.
[2680.98s -> 2681.98s]  I'm just killing them all.
[2681.98s -> 2684.70s]  I don't even know what the fuck's going on.
[2685.54s -> 2690.80s]  Like they it feels like the enemy team has not like they didn't they didn't like understand we were playing league
[2691.24s -> 2693.70s]  Right, like they queued up and they were like, oh, yeah, this is league
[2694.98s -> 2696.98s]  That's what this feels like
[2697.66s -> 2701.66s]  This is what I imagine if like Mike Tyson went into a preschool, you know what I mean? Like this is what this feels like
[2721.80s -> 2723.80s]  much say I
[2733.66s -> 2735.66s]  probably could have killed those guys, but
[2736.90s -> 2749.37s]  Now one of the chill I'm assuming the Wukong is gonna come bot soon
[2754.44s -> 2755.96s]  There he is
[2755.96s -> 2764.13s]  Damn it. I quenched late. I
[2764.73s -> 2766.73s]  actually kill both
[2766.97s -> 2768.97s]  That was a late cleanse by me
[2769.17s -> 2771.17s]  my bad
[2771.85s -> 2773.85s]  I don't want to take the risk coming back up
[2774.81s -> 2779.45s]  She stuns me they can one-shot me. I should have killed the fucking guy though
[2780.97s -> 2785.25s]  The Wukong I just backed up too far and then I cleansed the stun for no like really late
[2785.25s -> 2795.06s]  I
[2795.06s -> 2797.06s]  Dare it was a man. So boys
[2797.62s -> 2802.06s]  Good evening. Good evening. Good morning. I don't know where the fuck you guys live. So good day
[2815.09s -> 2816.97s]  Fuck am I watching?
[2816.97s -> 2827.77s]  Wait that Wukong lived
[2828.01s -> 2837.08s]  Whoa, bro. Oh, I'm dead
[2839.20s -> 2841.20s]  Dude that wall was BS
[2843.20s -> 2847.24s]  There was like a little hole and then I flashed late because I was like, oh I could walk out the hole
[2847.76s -> 2849.76s]  But I couldn't walk out the tiny little hole
[2850.32s -> 2853.88s]  Mother fuckers I
[2854.44s -> 2863.57s]  Shouldn't have even been there. But like I'm stupid. I should just push bot. I was like dude
[2863.57s -> 2866.45s]  That's such a bad fight, but I walked over to those like I'm really fat
[2867.55s -> 2870.89s]  honestly, I'd probably could have killed him if I didn't if I had like flashed the
[2872.09s -> 2876.94s]  Done any stuns the only
[2878.00s -> 2883.76s]  Like most over like I swear if they reduced any stun by like point five seconds. She would never get played
[2885.02s -> 2886.58s]  like actually
[2886.58s -> 2890.04s]  The only reason to play Annie is her stun is just so OP
[2890.76s -> 2896.86s]  Because it's like a it's like the reason they changed Tarek so long ago where like when you have a point-click CC
[2900.30s -> 2902.40s]  It's typically really broken
[2911.14s -> 2913.14s]  Okay, I'm just dead
[2913.64s -> 2915.92s]  Does Tarek not have ult leveled up at six?
[2916.62s -> 2923.45s]  He didn't level his ulti
[2940.62s -> 2942.90s]  Maybe it's maybe Tarek ult sucks
[2944.97s -> 2946.97s]  Maybe it's underpowered, you know
[2946.97s -> 2960.38s]  Oh shit, I'm gonna walk over and help the homies. You never walk over and help the homies when the homies are getting shit on because
[2960.38s -> 2963.38s]  If you have like 900 gold or a thousand gold lead like like I did or whatever you don't want to do that's because
[2963.38s -> 2965.38s]  You'll give MF a ton of kills
[2965.38s -> 2967.38s]  We're in a good spot now though
[2967.38s -> 2969.38s]  But I am still a little
[2969.38s -> 2971.38s]  I'm still a little
[2971.38s -> 2973.38s]  I'm still a little
[2973.38s -> 2975.38s]  I'm still a little
[2975.38s -> 2977.38s]  I'm still a little
[2977.38s -> 2979.38s]  I'm still a little
[2979.38s -> 2983.72s]  I'm still a little
[2983.72s -> 2994.26s]  I'm still a little
[2994.26s -> 3001.93s]  but i am still a little wait taric oh he leveled his ult nice this taric does not know how to
[3001.93s -> 3012.39s]  play taric by the way he's throwing out his stun so awkwardly that's okay though i mean i
[3012.39s -> 3026.07s]  apparently don't know how to play draven so can't really blame the guy i mean you guys are doing
[3026.07s -> 3045.85s]  dragon with no smite but it seems like doing dragon with no smite i mean we could fight these
[3045.85s -> 3057.19s]  fights but it's like painful. We could easily fight these fights. I think a lot of it is
[3057.19s -> 3062.19s]  just like Tarrick isn't confident enough to walk up and stun right? Like that's that's
[3062.19s -> 3066.03s]  what I'm seeing the issue is. He's doing the thing where like he's not he doesn't
[3066.03s -> 3072.89s]  have the confidence to actually walk up since he's a melee champ. So he's walking
[3072.89s -> 3078.69s]  up and like taking half his health and it's making him nervous. It happens a lot with
[3078.69s -> 3085.81s]  players uh who aren't very melee champ centric because melee supports are actually pretty risky
[3085.81s -> 3101.30s]  or they're pretty scary rather oh he's totally dead i don't remember but yeah melee supports
[3101.30s -> 3106.98s]  are scary to play uh because you have to know when you can get a kill by going in because
[3106.98s -> 3118.99s]  you're gonna take damage right that's just like the nature of melee supports nice we're coming
[3118.99s -> 3123.95s]  back in a bit. Not bad. We threw a little bit early but yeah we're starting to get it back.
[3123.95s -> 3132.58s]  We're showing. Taric's a never good. I'm always confused by Taric because he feels like such a
[3132.58s -> 3139.62s]  good champion. Like the champion itself feels broken as shit. Like whenever I see Taric I think
[3139.62s -> 3151.70s]  I think to myself like, he's either unkillably like super OP or they're like 0-10.
[3151.70s -> 3152.70s]  There's no in between, right?
[3152.70s -> 3155.58s]  Like they either know how to play Taric or they don't, is what it feels like.
[3155.58s -> 3171.36s]  Oh, you are, I mean, yeah, you are wrong.
[3171.36s -> 3174.76s]  Taric actually requires mechanics.
[3174.76s -> 3175.76s]  That's actually true.
[3175.76s -> 3180.24s]  Whereas like most supports, like Nautilus doesn't have mechanics, you know?
[3180.24s -> 3183.80s]  like what's crank doesn't have mechanics they just hit their button and if it if
[3183.80s -> 3190.20s]  it works they they get a kill where's like Tarek after you stun there is like
[3190.20s -> 3212.50s]  stuff you have to do that doesn't make sense or block do you think um oh I'm
[3212.50s -> 3221.35s]  gonna die oh thank God do you think Tarek's one of the harder supports I
[3221.35s -> 3227.03s]  think he's I think he's pretty hard like I don't think he's well I mean
[3227.03s -> 3230.39s]  he's harder than the other supports like I think like I don't think there's
[3230.39s -> 3260.30s]  justbaskedbomba I'm just gonna die. I'm not gonna try and flash. I don't think I should
[3260.30s -> 3264.54s]  have just flashed over. But I kind of got baited by the taric olt I wanted to see like
[3264.54s -> 3272.12s]  if I could fight. But there's too much CC. I was like, Oh, he's ulting me. Let's go.
[3272.12s -> 3276.56s]  I can tell this is a really low evil game. Because there's so much random deaths like
[3276.56s -> 3283.04s]  I'm falling victim to like I'm autopiloting and like I'm not thinking and I'm just talking to you guys and I'm just dying for free
[3283.52s -> 3287.12s]  But it's like there's so many people just dying for free. It's hilarious
[3287.76s -> 3289.84s]  Thresh thresh isn't actually that hard
[3290.48s -> 3292.48s]  so
[3292.72s -> 3297.68s]  Like a lot of people think like thresh mechanically is very difficult because he is harder than the other supports
[3298.08s -> 3300.48s]  But he's not actually that hard. He's like
[3301.28s -> 3304.32s]  once you learn the thresh combos, he's pretty much
[3304.32s -> 3320.24s]  much a very upfront champion. Yeah, like, like lantern, for example, is one of the most
[3320.24s -> 3325.16s]  broken things to ever be put in league and everybody fucks it up. Like people will will
[3325.16s -> 3329.04s]  just mess up lantern because they'll throw it for souls or they'll mess it like you
[3329.04s -> 3335.78s]  can literally just hold lantern perma and your ad carry can walk up auto the turret
[3335.78s -> 3345.70s]  and and and you literally like they literally can't play the game after that. Like
[3345.70s -> 3348.54s]  The enemy team I'm in because like there's nothing they can do to stop it
[3349.06s -> 3352.44s]  We can totally fight this by the way
[3353.36s -> 3356.96s]  So like I've done that before we're like my thresh. Well, I know I have a good throw
[3356.96s -> 3358.96s]  Hold on. Let me let me win this team fight really quick
[3360.36s -> 3383.86s]  Give me a sec
[3383.86s -> 3387.62s]  Okay, cool. Sorry. I had to win that team power quick. Okay, so as I was saying
[3388.18s -> 3390.18s]  There's a lot more to thresh than
[3391.26s -> 3393.26s]  people think right
[3393.30s -> 3397.22s]  It's essentially people over complicate like what he needs to do
[3397.22s -> 3403.00s]  So it's like Thresh is a very basic, like when you see Thresh in pro play, you don't ever see like what you do
[3403.00s -> 3405.00s]  But it's very rare that you see like the sick
[3405.28s -> 3410.34s]  Permahooking like oh my god, like it's mainly like they pick him for like lantern
[3411.48s -> 3412.64s]  Straight up
[3412.64s -> 3414.56s]  Like when they pick Thresh in high elo
[3414.56s -> 3422.36s]  He's not picked to be the god tier like always landing permacisi hooks like flay god like he's picked to like shut down engage and
[3423.68s -> 3425.48s]  remove
[3425.48s -> 3432.52s]  Kill threat to your carries. That's all he's picked for but he's literally just an EW bot
[3434.95s -> 3439.95s]  Armour stacking. I mean, yeah, the armor thing on Thresh is nice, but it's I wouldn't say it's like OP on his kit
[3440.63s -> 3446.09s]  It just makes him like not die to 80 carries in two seconds
[3446.65s -> 3457.94s]  What is happening? But I instantly know I'm playing with a good Thresh player when I can walk up to the turret
[3461.66s -> 3463.66s]  When I can walk up to the turret and the threat
[3475.54s -> 3477.54s]  Sorry, I was trying to think and talk at the same time
[3477.54s -> 3481.54s]  When I can walk up to the turret, my Thresh player won't walk up and auto the turret with me.
[3481.54s -> 3483.54s]  That's like the sign of a good Thresh player.
[3483.54s -> 3489.54s]  When we don't know where the enemy is, and instead of walking up and trying to hit the turret to like help you kill the turret,
[3489.54s -> 3494.54s]  they'll stand in the back and literally just sit there and wait and hold lantern until, uh,
[3494.54s -> 3501.62s]  they just hold their lantern until like you can, until you get ganked, essentially.
[3501.62s -> 3508.89s]  And that's why, like I said, I just personally don't think Thresh's mechanics are as hard as people think.
[3508.89s -> 3513.41s]  I do think he's he's very knowledge-based. I think Thresh has high knowledge caps
[3514.01s -> 3516.89s]  Where like if you're playing I don't know like Lulu
[3517.33s -> 3521.85s]  Your skill is basically like do I W you your decision-making on Lulu is literally
[3522.25s -> 3527.29s]  Do I W to speed or do I W to CC right? Like that's your that's your decision-making
[3527.61s -> 3529.93s]  So it's like obviously much higher than that
[3530.77s -> 3532.85s]  but it's a
[3532.85s -> 3536.17s]  you son of a bitch
[3536.17s -> 3538.53s]  But it's still not like that bad. I
[3538.53s -> 3545.09s]  I think Thresh just intimidates people because he can do so much and so I
[3545.09s -> 3547.93s]  think people just get intimidated but because they they think it looks
[3547.93s -> 3555.68s]  overwhelming to learn the champ. I feel like that actually intimidates a lot of
[3555.68s -> 3560.36s]  people in terms of like people not wanting to learn new champions and shits.
[3560.36s -> 3567.32s]  I feel like a lot of it is just people are nervous about learning
[3567.32s -> 3574.36s]  champions that look overwhelming right like a felios for example I was talking
[3574.36s -> 3579.00s]  about this yesterday a felios is not a hard mechanical champion like he's
[3579.00s -> 3584.20s]  difficult in terms of the knowledge required like he's knowledge gated very
[3584.20s -> 3589.60s]  hard right so like you have to play him a decent amount or like research
[3589.60s -> 3593.80s]  him to understand what guns do what how to interact with the guns stuff
[3593.80s -> 3598.04s]  like that right but the actual mechanics of using the guns it's
[3598.04s -> 3599.28s]  It's actually not hard.
[3600.60s -> 3614.11s]  Guys, what are we doing?
[3614.11s -> 3618.95s]  I guess we're just winning the fight.
[3618.95s -> 3621.75s]  Pike?
[3621.75s -> 3626.60s]  Like, I think Pike's harder than Thresh.
[3626.60s -> 3627.60s]  Maybe that's a hot take,
[3627.60s -> 3631.86s]  but I think Pike is harder than Thresh.
[3631.86s -> 3637.16s]  Because Pike requires like really specific...
[3637.16s -> 3640.76s]  Pike is a lot harder to play than he looks
[3641.84s -> 3643.40s]  when you see people play him.
[3644.90s -> 3647.68s]  Because there's like timers of when you can go in
[3647.68s -> 3649.28s]  off of certain things.
[3649.28s -> 3655.04s]  hitting his ulti consistently in team fights is a little harder than people think and knowing how to
[3655.04s -> 3661.04s]  position in the lane like Pyke is capable of a lot more than people think so I think Pyke's I think
[3661.04s -> 3669.47s]  the reason the main reason I think Pyke's a little harder is because he's melee like melee
[3669.47s -> 3675.07s]  champions are always going to be like mechanically more difficult than ranged if the melee champion
[3675.07s -> 3682.90s]  is like you have to engage to go in and do stuff because there's always the counter play
[3682.90s -> 3693.70s]  factor support role yeah that's what i'm saying it's like i'm not saying overall like overall
[3693.70s -> 3697.94s]  ranged champions require a lot more mechanics than melee just because you're ranged you can
[3697.94s -> 3703.06s]  die in a global and you have to space and stuff but i think that like in just the support you
[3703.06s -> 3707.70s]  support support specific i think melees are a lot harder to play that's why you see a lot of
[3707.70s -> 3712.82s]  like support players we give like the best support players in the world are really good at
[3712.82s -> 3717.30s]  like the engage melee supports not the like enchanters and that's why you see like why we
[3717.30s -> 3725.52s]  praise the best support players because like when you see somebody go in like perfectly on Rakan
[3725.52s -> 3734.02s]  or go in like find a way in without getting knocked up on like I don't know something like
[3734.02s -> 3750.64s]  when they find the angle on Thresh and it's really nice. Rell. I think Rell sucks. I think
[3750.64s -> 3763.42s]  that champ is so bad because she just like she doesn't do anything. Like Rell's initial thing
[3763.42s -> 3769.02s]  was like she was supposed to go in be really tanky and then be like a stun bot for like
[3769.02s -> 3774.94s]  team fights she was a team fight monster but the problem with rel is like she has one chance
[3774.94s -> 3779.42s]  essentially in lane phase like if anybody has fingers on their hands and they can move left
[3779.42s -> 3784.94s]  and right rel's really easy to dodge like it's actually like it's incredibly easy to beat a
[3784.94s -> 3789.98s]  rel in lane to not die to her like you just have to move left and right right it's very
[3789.98s -> 3798.06s]  simple so it's like it's much more difficult to dodge like other engaged champs if that makes
[3798.06s -> 3801.74s]  sense like nautilus you can still move left and right but it's like he can walk at you while it's
[3801.74s -> 3807.82s]  happening whereas like if rao walks at you i'm still like just waiting for the animation and
[3807.82s -> 3814.62s]  then i can simply move to the left because like her animation is so slow on using her ability
[3814.62s -> 3819.74s]  that i can like dash i can flash i can there's so much counter play and it's like unless
[3819.74s -> 3823.34s]  she flashes on you, but even then you can tell she's gonna flash on you. So it's like,
[3824.78s -> 3831.66s]  I also feel like mid game Rell has this issue where she has her one trick ulti engage fight
[3831.66s -> 3838.27s]  in teamfights, but after she does that, she does literally nothing. Right? She's like a one
[3838.27s -> 3851.62s]  and done. That's why, like, she feels like she doesn't have other expression. She's countered
[3851.62s -> 3859.54s]  so hard by the meta too. Meleo counters Rell engage. Thresh counters Rell engage. Right?
[3859.54s -> 3877.26s]  Like either either of those champions shits on rel engage and you can't do anything. Like I don't know if you've ever tried to play rel
[3878.04s -> 3880.42s]  Gone in and been like thresh flayed
[3880.98s -> 3883.22s]  But it's the worst feeling
[3883.94s -> 3890.86s]  It's a bad feeling. It's like when people play Leona. It's the same reason Leona's shit right now
[3891.50s -> 3892.54s]  like
[3892.54s -> 3894.82s]  They both have the same idea of why they're bad, right?
[3895.90s -> 3899.10s]  They like have they're both good at doing what they're supposed to do
[3899.10s -> 3902.78s]  You know, stun and create pressure and point click and shit.
[3902.78s -> 3909.18s]  But the problem is, is like, you can easily counter pick them so incredibly hard that they
[3909.18s -> 3910.74s]  just become worthless the whole game.
[3910.74s -> 3916.15s]  Have you ever gotten Senna's secondary mission?
[3916.15s -> 3917.83s]  Oh, all the time.
[3917.83s -> 3921.39s]  With Senna being, like with Thresh being meta and Senna being like a champion I'm
[3921.39s -> 3926.07s]  playing a lot, I get that all the time.
[3926.07s -> 3929.31s]  You don't even notice it though, I'm gonna be real.
[3929.31s -> 3931.79s]  When you kill the Thresh or whatever and you get his souls, you don't even fucking
[3931.79s -> 3940.53s]  notice it because it's like 40 armor and it's like you're level 17 or some shit at that
[3940.53s -> 3941.53s]  point.
[3941.53s -> 3946.31s]  Like at the point you're getting it you're such a high level that like the 40 random
[3946.31s -> 3949.07s]  armor like it's nice but I never really notice it.
[3949.07s -> 3958.74s]  Trying to get your teammates ahead isn't that good?
[3958.74s -> 3962.68s]  You know what I've actually been doing as support on my main account?
[3962.68s -> 3976.37s]  I've actually been roaming non-stop and it's super OP because the key to roaming
[3976.37s -> 3984.05s]  is all you have to do to roam well is literally be there one or two times in the first five
[3984.05s -> 3990.29s]  minutes of the game to completely fuck over the enemy one time on an engage or something
[3990.29s -> 3994.53s]  and they get so far behind from it that you can literally just walk back bot.
[3998.40s -> 4002.16s]  Like I do it on Senna. Like I'll push bot lane. This is this is my strategy in Senna.
[4002.16s -> 4005.92s]  I'm gonna give it to you guys, okay? So I don't know I don't know if this works in
[4005.92s -> 4012.16s]  low elo but in like masters like high masters this works at least this is all i do on senna every
[4012.16s -> 4016.80s]  single player i play against on senna every single one except for like pike players even
[4016.80s -> 4021.60s]  nautilus blitz they they all can seed lane level one every single one of them right they just they
[4021.60s -> 4027.76s]  just let me push level one and so i'll push the waves in level one and i'll either crash
[4027.76s -> 4033.28s]  wave two or wave three depending on how far they're giving me like push power right so
[4033.28s -> 4036.12s]  So I will always crash wave two or wave three bot,
[4036.12s -> 4041.12s]  and I will immediately roam mid every time.
[4043.08s -> 4047.00s]  And even if I don't get a kill,
[4047.00s -> 4050.28s]  usually it fucks over the enemy mid laner so badly
[4050.28s -> 4053.08s]  because on that exact timer,
[4053.08s -> 4060.06s]  there's usually a gank happening on mid.
[4060.06s -> 4062.18s]  So a lot of the time,
[4062.18s -> 4063.52s]  people think that you're roaming
[4063.52s -> 4065.26s]  to get a kill for the laner.
[4065.26s -> 4069.22s]  You're not, you're roaming to counter pressure
[4069.22s -> 4073.57s]  from the other players in the game.
[4073.57s -> 4075.01s]  How many times have you guys been like,
[4075.01s -> 4077.89s]  oh, we can win this 2v2, you see the enemy jungler,
[4077.89s -> 4079.01s]  your jungler comes, you're like, oh,
[4079.01s -> 4080.73s]  we're gonna bait this, and then all of a sudden
[4080.73s -> 4083.33s]  the support shows up, and you're like, God damn it.
[4083.33s -> 4085.79s]  And then you die, and you're like, what the fuck?
[4085.79s -> 4088.75s]  That right there is how easy it is to play support.
[4088.75s -> 4093.75s]  Because all you have to do is show up once, twice.
[4093.75s -> 4102.24s]  And now that entire lane is fucked for the enemy team.
[4102.24s -> 4103.96s]  Roaming is so easy.
[4103.96s -> 4106.76s]  The only thing, people fuck up roaming really bad
[4106.76s -> 4108.40s]  when they roam on timers
[4108.40s -> 4111.30s]  where their AD carry can't safely farm.
[4111.30s -> 4113.66s]  So what ends up happening is on that timer, right?
[4113.66s -> 4116.28s]  Where like I told you wave two, three, right?
[4116.28s -> 4119.56s]  What happens is you push that wave in, you roam mid.
[4119.56s -> 4121.12s]  Let's say nothing happens, okay?
[4121.12s -> 4123.28s]  I can just walk back bot.
[4123.28s -> 4125.10s]  It's, you lose nothing.
[4125.10s -> 4126.72s]  And if usually at that point, you're not,
[4126.72s -> 4127.86s]  you have like 300 gold,
[4127.86s -> 4129.44s]  so there's no point backing, right?
[4129.44s -> 4130.60s]  Now let's say like,
[4130.60s -> 4134.24s]  I notice that my jungler is like invading top side.
[4134.24s -> 4136.24s]  I just walk over to top and help him.
[4137.52s -> 4140.32s]  Because you have like three to four,
[4140.32s -> 4141.96s]  you have like three to four waves
[4141.96s -> 4143.68s]  before the enemy bot lane.
[4143.68s -> 4150.76s]  The enemy bot lane has to play it almost perfectly
[4150.76s -> 4154.38s]  to be able to abuse your roam on certain timers.
[4155.88s -> 4157.28s]  They essentially have to play it perfect
[4157.28s -> 4158.80s]  to abuse the roam.
[4158.80s -> 4160.44s]  What I mean by that is like,
[4160.44s -> 4163.10s]  the best way to abuse a support roaming
[4163.10s -> 4166.74s]  is you either A, if you have the ability to dive,
[4166.74s -> 4171.06s]  you can pretty much A, immediately dive,
[4171.06s -> 4173.20s]  like push the next wave and then immediately dive
[4173.20s -> 4174.42s]  if you like have that ability,
[4174.42s -> 4176.34s]  say you're playing Leona Draven or something,
[4176.34s -> 4178.16s]  but even then it's a little risky
[4178.16s -> 4180.14s]  because then the AD carry can just walk back
[4180.14s -> 4182.50s]  and they only lose one wave and you gave up,
[4182.50s -> 4185.18s]  you know, a stack chance, so it's not that bad.
[4185.18s -> 4188.46s]  Two, you can stack the wave.
[4188.46s -> 4191.66s]  Now, stacking the wave is the best way to counter it
[4191.66s -> 4194.24s]  because let's say I'm roaming for an extended period,
[4194.24s -> 4195.98s]  you stack like a three wave
[4195.98s -> 4197.34s]  and then all of a sudden you're crashing it
[4197.34s -> 4199.10s]  and then you wanna like your up a level
[4199.10s -> 4200.38s]  because you've been gaining XP
[4200.38s -> 4202.26s]  and the AD carry has to back off.
[4202.26s -> 4203.78s]  But the way to counter that
[4203.78s -> 4206.62s]  is you simply just walk back on the timer
[4206.62s -> 4208.46s]  of the stacked wave crashing as an AD carry
[4208.46s -> 4209.70s]  or as a support.
[4209.70s -> 4211.74s]  It's so incredibly easy to do.
[4211.74s -> 4213.70s]  It's actually brainlessly easy to do.
[4214.46s -> 4216.24s]  Like it's literally,
[4217.14s -> 4219.24s]  you can roam all you want bot lane
[4219.24s -> 4222.90s]  as long as you are in bot lane for the stacked wave crashes
[4222.90s -> 4224.78s]  or you are in bot lane when your jungler
[4224.78s -> 4230.85s]  is bot side of the map.
[4230.85s -> 4234.09s]  It's easy as fuck.
[4234.09s -> 4236.95s]  But support players drool on themselves.
[4236.95s -> 4238.79s]  So they like to essentially,
[4240.25s -> 4243.47s]  support players like to like AFK in the lane phase.
[4243.47s -> 4246.37s]  They like to literally sit there and just do nothing.
[4248.19s -> 4249.55s]  That's like the average support I see
[4249.55s -> 4254.88s]  is they will stand and do nothing.
[4254.88s -> 4256.98s]  And I've said this before, but I'll say it again,
[4256.98s -> 4262.48s]  Being a good support is not being a better player than the enemy team, being a good support is queuing up to play League of Legends.
[4263.98s -> 4269.48s]  That's all it takes. All it takes to be a good support is queuing up with the intent to push buttons in the game.
[4270.48s -> 4271.48s]  And not just AFK.
[4498.50s -> 4500.00s]  Alright, I am back.
[4501.00s -> 4501.50s]  What's up?
[4503.00s -> 4504.50s]  I don't even remember what we were talking about.
[4505.00s -> 4506.50s]  Oh, supports. Yeah, they're all stupid.
[4511.25s -> 4515.25s]  Don't AFK on support, you'll gain LP. It's actually that easy.
[4528.21s -> 4530.73s]  Honestly, I don't think supports are stupid. I think it's more of a
[4531.61s -> 4534.85s]  How do I phrase this? It's in my opinion. It's more of like a
[4537.46s -> 4546.81s]  They're like they've never they don't have to learn support boys like don't have to learn
[4548.13s -> 4553.07s]  Important things because they can get away with not doing it. So they get they develop bad habits. That's all it is
[4553.61s -> 4564.41s]  Do you have a Spotify playlist?
[4564.45s -> 4570.66s]  Yeah, best role to climb. I
[4571.74s -> 4574.38s]  Think every role is good to climb as long as you're good
[4574.38s -> 4580.06s]  Oh, I don't see whatever you linked like I don't allow links in the chat because I had
[4580.06s -> 4590.32s]  to turn them off a long time ago so I can't see it.
[4590.32s -> 4594.04s]  I would say that climbing is just about like whatever because every role you can climb
[4594.04s -> 4599.00s]  on right like every single role so climbing a lot of the time is just about what you
[4599.00s -> 4607.72s]  think is most fun for you and you can get the best at.
[4607.72s -> 4616.20s]  I would say objectively the best roles to climb on are jungle and support for just like
[4616.20s -> 4617.20s]  higher elo.
[4617.20s -> 4621.44s]  Well, jungle and lower elo support and higher elo.
[4621.44s -> 4625.60s]  I wouldn't climb on support in like gold because you're not going to have a good
[4625.60s -> 4630.56s]  time trying to like help bad players play the game bad.
[4630.56s -> 4635.36s]  It's mean people who don't like you can get it like a gold Ezreal 30 kills by being
[4635.36s -> 4640.72s]  the better support, but you won't always win. Whereas like if you really want to control solo queue
[4640.72s -> 4645.52s]  and your teammates aren't like good enough to carry at that level by themselves, right? Like
[4645.52s -> 4660.32s]  you get frustrated. Just pick something that has more agency in the game. You lost 18 of 24
[4660.32s -> 4665.60s]  as jungle. You want to turn any role. I mean, you can play AD. If you think it's... AD carry is
[4665.60s -> 4680.36s]  I wouldn't say it's like fun, but it's not bad, you're in gold.
[4680.36s -> 4682.24s]  I mean you could try it.
[4682.24s -> 4685.56s]  My view on it is if people were wondering if they want to play a role or not, my view
[4685.56s -> 4687.24s]  is just try it, see if you like it.
[4687.24s -> 4689.48s]  Because if you don't like the role, you're not going to be able to put in enough games
[4689.48s -> 4690.88s]  to get good at the role, right?
[4690.88s -> 4694.60s]  So like, just give it a try, see if you enjoy it or not.
[4694.60s -> 4698.44s]  And if like it's not fun, then if it's not your play style, it's not fun.
[4698.44s -> 4703.56s]  Because AD carry is a very unique playstyle from all the other roles.
[4703.56s -> 4710.64s]  The reason people don't like playing AD carry and watching AD carry streamers and shit is
[4710.64s -> 4716.36s]  because AD carry is like, it's boring.
[4716.36s -> 4719.15s]  AD carry is like zero.
[4719.15s -> 4723.39s]  Like, if there was a graph of shit going on when you're playing AD carry in the game,
[4723.39s -> 4724.39s]  it's like this.
[4724.39s -> 4728.75s]  Then it's like spikes to a hundred and then it's back to like this, right?
[4728.75s -> 4737.16s]  It's like, ad carry is a lot of, every game is different, right?
[4737.16s -> 4743.88s]  Every game when you play ad carry is different, because you're always with a different player,
[4743.88s -> 4745.78s]  like a different support, unless you do OQ.
[4745.78s -> 4752.20s]  So every ad carry's game's different, coupled with, you spend a lot of the game just farming.
[4752.20s -> 4755.14s]  Like you don't get to interact with the enemy a lot.
[4755.14s -> 4761.50s]  So you just kind of farm a lot of the game, and even then, you basically are farming for
[4761.50s -> 4764.70s]  like little dopamine hits of like team fights and stuff that you get around the game.
[4764.70s -> 4768.42s]  So that's kind of fun.
[4768.42s -> 4770.30s]  But like I said, it's all you.
[4770.30s -> 4771.86s]  You can climb on any role.
[4771.86s -> 4778.82s]  I think AD carry requires the most mechanical skill to climb because the difference between...
[4778.82s -> 4781.46s]  Climbing is like a jungler is about being in the right spot at the right time, right?
[4781.46s -> 4784.42s]  Like you need to path this way, get objectives, etc.
[4784.42s -> 4789.62s]  an ad carry is more about like this person fucked up their positioning I'm gonna kill them type shit
[4812.36s -> 4823.46s]  we're gonna start with Q also I want to I want to say something uh if you are playing
[4824.34s -> 4829.62s]  make sure and this is just a really good standardized bit of advice make sure you're
[4829.62s -> 4833.30s]  always tracking what the enemy cooldowns are what their spells are stuff like that's
[4836.38s -> 4841.26s]  okay because playing the game is not just about like farming and and you know like your team
[4841.26s -> 4845.34s]  goes into the auto and shits. Like right now mid's mia right? I can see that varus is mia,
[4845.34s -> 4849.34s]  but it is a varus so like I'm not too worried about being like level two'd by a varus.
[4850.30s -> 4853.74s]  Not that much right? So I can kind of play backward because I know that
[4855.18s -> 4858.22s]  it's a high chance he's not gonna rumbot a level two as a varus. Now if that was like
[4858.22s -> 4863.26s]  a fizz or some shit I immediately back up. So we notice that it's pretty obvious rakan
[4863.26s -> 4867.50s]  probably got w level two we don't know what it is but he has q so he doesn't have shield
[4867.50s -> 4878.03s]  which means because he doesn't have shield it's hard for the Rakan to get
[4878.03s -> 4881.91s]  back out if he fucks up and engage so you need to think about these type of
[4881.91s -> 4886.67s]  things right now this is wave 4 I believe and because it's wave 4 we're
[4886.67s -> 4890.35s]  gonna get level 3 on wave 4 you always get level 3 on wave 4 if you have
[4890.35s -> 4899.87s]  full XP you get level 2 on wave 2 and you get level 3 on wave 4 and these
[4899.87s -> 4908.00s]  timers for when you get certain level ups bot lane are very important now I'm
[4908.00s -> 4914.24s]  gonna hover over here you see how fiddle is right here I'm actually gonna just
[4914.24s -> 4920.24s]  walk in here and see if I can get like yeah we see him nice see this is
[4920.24s -> 4924.20s]  exactly what I was talking about before do you see what my support is doing
[4924.20s -> 4926.84s]  I I left the lane
[4927.96s -> 4934.56s]  Guys, I walked to like stand next to my jungler after we pushed the wave in my Lulu is
[4935.68s -> 4959.51s]  Hanging out by herself bot lane. They should just chill it. You don't want to do that
[4960.45s -> 4965.47s]  You don't ever want to be the guy who's like by yourself bot lane as a support
[4966.73s -> 4967.97s]  because
[4967.97s -> 4970.93s]  You don't know like supports don't need gold, right? Not really
[4971.29s -> 4973.81s]  And you don't need farm you don't need all that shit
[4973.81s -> 4978.37s]  So if your ad carry roams and unless the wave is fucked and they're just being stupid and you have to fix the wave
[4978.37s -> 4980.69s]  Or something you don't want to be by yourself in the lane
[4981.25s -> 4988.17s]  It just doesn't do anything. How do they not auto tower? Oh, I used
[4989.17s -> 4994.73s]  Tilda so there's a way there's actually a setting you can have in the game where when you hit a button
[4995.33s -> 5002.69s]  It makes it so that I can't physically hit anything but a champion. It's target. It's called target champions only
[5003.05s -> 5007.57s]  And it's basically like here. I'll do it for you right now watch you see how like I can hit the tower you see how
[5007.57s -> 5008.81s]  It's the red
[5008.81s -> 5010.81s]  sword
[5011.17s -> 5014.81s]  So when I hit this button, I can no longer hit the tower or the minions
[5015.93s -> 5017.93s]  But I can still hit the champions
[5019.65s -> 5025.49s]  So essentially when you're fighting at a big minion wave or you're fighting under a turret you don't want to miss click
[5026.89s -> 5029.25s]  you just hit target champions only button and
[5029.25s -> 5033.79s]  And it makes it a thousand times easier because you can literally only hit the champion
[5034.17s -> 5051.23s]  It's really nice and you can make the button anything you want. Obviously. I just I use tilde. It's the default
[5051.23s -> 5061.52s]  I actually want to kill these guys, but I need to wait for the wave to push out just a hair
[5062.60s -> 5066.66s]  The jungler could be bought but it is a fiddlestick. So it's like I don't really care about a Phil sticks being bought
[5067.02s -> 5082.95s]  We can straight up just kill them. Okay. Well, apparently we can't kill them
[5086.88s -> 5089.92s]  Because apparently my Lulu didn't want to walk up
[5090.88s -> 5095.78s]  That's so frustrating man, I did fuck up my my auto there
[5095.78s -> 5101.34s]  But I am a little I am kind of curious what happens. I don't have to go watch the VOD
[5101.34s -> 5106.26s]  I fucked up my kill in the Xayah. I think I walked to left instead or down my movement was bad
[5106.62s -> 5110.84s]  Like essentially when they fought right? I walked like this. I should have walked like this
[5111.76s -> 5115.12s]  Because you want to cut off the Xayah from the gank now
[5115.12s -> 5118.88s]  I do think when Lulu just blindly ran away. I think she kind of griefed
[5118.88s -> 5124.00s]  You don't need to insta run from ganks, especially when like you could see what I have right? I have Dirk and Sheen
[5125.48s -> 5131.20s]  Something that a lot of people do as well is they will see that like the numbers are uneven and they'll instantly run away
[5131.20s -> 5135.00s]  They don't think about like how to win the fight or like what the the win con is of the fight
[5135.32s -> 5137.24s]  Because that's what I was saying before we got ganked right?
[5137.24s -> 5141.92s]  I was like fiddle can't gank us and he can't pre six fiddle does nothing in the gank. I had cleanse
[5142.92s -> 5148.72s]  They don't actually beat us in 3v2. So the problem was is we weren't focusing the same target
[5148.72s -> 5154.04s]  I went for the Zyia and she backed really far up now if we had played forward a bit
[5154.40s -> 5158.64s]  Like say she played a little more forward with me that would have gone a lot better or if I had played a little more back
[5158.64s -> 5166.40s]  With her it was basically like we don't have comms. So the you know, it got rough now fiddle is six now
[5166.78s -> 5168.78s]  So it's a little scary. I
[5169.50s -> 5173.48s]  Don't like playing versus fiddle sticks for like the reason of like 90% of the time
[5174.46s -> 5178.18s]  Players don't know how to ward around fiddle people put wards and weird spots
[5178.74s -> 5182.87s]  We should have won that fight though. I'm a little salty
[5183.65s -> 5194.64s]  Mainly myself. So this too Lulu keeps speeding me up
[5197.32s -> 5206.21s]  I'm gonna be honest with you. I don't like when Lulu's do that. It's like a pet peeve thing of mine when Lulu's use their speed
[5206.89s -> 5210.45s]  Okay, I'm okay with it if I need to dodge something or I need to chase somebody
[5210.73s -> 5214.49s]  But I think it's just so much less value than using it to CC early game
[5214.49s -> 5222.45s]  Early game the CC of Lulu like using W is so broken to me because they they just physically can't move their character for
[5222.89s -> 5232.78s]  Like 1.5 seconds, which is crazy. I think Fiddle's bot
[5234.34s -> 5236.34s]  You can kind of tell
[5236.84s -> 5242.50s]  You see how they're playing really aggressive. They don't beat us 2v2
[5243.10s -> 5245.86s]  So I'm thinking and they just cleared this ward out
[5246.74s -> 5251.14s]  I'm thinking Fiddle is either on dragon or he's bush ganking bot somewhere
[5251.66s -> 5259.94s]  So I don't really want to walk up. You see how this guy is confidently hitting the turret?
[5260.02s -> 5267.04s]  This is making me think Fiddles trying to lane gank because they cannot beat us 2v2
[5267.46s -> 5274.74s]  Like I think Fiddles in here. So I'm actually just gonna play safe
[5276.38s -> 5278.38s]  Until we see him on the map, I don't know
[5279.46s -> 5290.51s]  I'm not gonna take the chance because
[5291.95s -> 5294.71s]  You got to think about like what you see and what you don't see on the map
[5294.79s -> 5298.87s]  Like we can't physically see Fiddle right? But think about this. We don't see him top
[5298.87s -> 5304.43s]  That's something you have to think about we we had a ward on rift just now for 15 15 seconds, right?
[5305.31s -> 5307.31s]  We didn't see him top
[5307.63s -> 5314.40s]  So like if he's not top, where is he now? I think he finally left
[5315.16s -> 5331.38s]  This looks like he went to dragon. Yeah. What are we doing by the way? I
[5332.58s -> 5334.46s]  Mean, I guess I'm just gonna die
[5334.46s -> 5337.96s]  Now would be the time to speed me. I
[5338.68s -> 5342.76s]  Mean, I don't even know what to say about that. Malzahar just didn't walk
[5342.76s -> 5354.68s]  Gragas didn't flash his E. Malzahar didn't walk. You always walk there by the way. I want to make this clear.
[5354.68s -> 5361.68s]  If you're a mid laner and you're playing a late game scaling mid, you always walk to the fight no matter what though.
[5361.68s -> 5364.68s]  If it's at, if it's going, if it's doing that.
[5365.44s -> 5367.44s]  Okay guys
[5367.88s -> 5375.24s]  We need to walk to fights and Lulu you need to follow up when I go in don't run
[5375.72s -> 5383.19s]  I'm just gonna type it because I'm actually fucking annoying. I'm a little frustrated
[5383.19s -> 5389.79s]  I still think the game is 100% winnable, but I'm playing Draven. We're playing like I'm playing fucking Ezreal or some shit
[5390.55s -> 5395.49s]  And I can't walk up because essentially we know fiddle was bought for the last two three minutes, right?
[5395.49s -> 5407.13s]  He just sat down there. What is my Lulu doing bro? What are you doing?
[5410.66s -> 5412.66s]  No, we we fight this go
[5413.30s -> 5422.15s]  Yeah, this guy doesn't get to do this for free now. They have a gale force. So I need to be a little care
[5423.15s -> 5425.15s]  This guy has no ulti though
[5427.74s -> 5430.70s]  Like this is what I'm losing my minds man
[5431.58s -> 5433.58s]  like dude just
[5433.70s -> 5438.60s]  follow
[5438.60s -> 5442.26s]  No, what she was doing was she was trying to protect her ward
[5442.26s -> 5444.42s]  ward.
[5444.42s -> 5449.46s]  She saw the Rakan hitting the ward, but the Xayah walked up to get a free to just die.
[5449.46s -> 5458.80s]  The problem is, my Lulu was like, oh, I don't want to give up my ward, and she wasn't thinking.
[5458.80s -> 5462.90s]  Please just sit with me, okay?
[5462.90s -> 5465.38s]  Yep, sorry.
[5465.38s -> 5468.06s]  I need you to follow me.
[5468.06s -> 5470.14s]  Always.
[5470.14s -> 5483.97s]  Even if it looks scary, you gotta follow, okay?
[5483.97s -> 5489.95s]  So one thing is, there's actually not a lot of fighting that happens in lower elo.
[5489.95s -> 5493.55s]  So a lot of these players don't know how to fight early.
[5493.55s -> 5497.67s]  Because one thing that I think has gotten really bad about League lately, just in
[5497.67s -> 5503.03s]  the past few years, is people don't ever limit test in League ever anymore.
[5503.03s -> 5505.85s]  They always just play like pussies.
[5505.85s -> 5509.25s]  Every single player in League plays like a fucking pussy nowadays.
[5509.25s -> 5519.12s]  And it's literally just like sad to see.
[5519.12s -> 5520.16s]  Like right there.
[5520.16s -> 5522.48s]  Why aren't we W-ing?
[5522.48s -> 5526.80s]  Use W on the Xayah.
[5526.80s -> 5527.80s]  Not to speed.
[5527.80s -> 5533.45s]  Like, I'm losing my mind.
[5533.45s -> 5536.37s]  Because all you have to do there is W the Xayah, she gets CC'd, we kill her on the
[5536.37s -> 5537.37s]  W.
[5537.37s -> 5545.39s]  I'm telling you, Lulu players are like hard-wired for some reason to not play correctly.
[5545.39s -> 5570.59s]  I'm never gonna catch this guy, he's got Galeforce and tier 2 boots.
[5570.59s -> 5574.19s]  Yeah, I mean I I have to go for it though because if I don't go for kills now the game's over
[5574.61s -> 5578.67s]  So it's either we go for it or we lose. So I'm willing to like look stupid
[5581.98s -> 5585.90s]  Honestly, this game was my fault for the one to be three that happened early
[5585.90s -> 5589.32s]  I misplayed it and if I didn't miss play that we would have won the game off it
[5590.22s -> 5592.22s]  Now the game's pretty much over
[5593.02s -> 5595.24s]  Like it's solo queue so we can always come back
[5595.24s -> 5602.06s]  But the problem is I don't think we have good enough players to come back like look at what Lulu's doing Lulu
[5603.18s -> 5605.18s]  Why are you bot solo?
[5605.18s -> 5606.18s]  At the moment.
[5606.18s -> 5609.13s]  Think.
[5609.13s -> 5610.13s]  Like what-
[5610.13s -> 5610.63s]  He's-
[5610.63s -> 5612.13s]  AAAAAAAAHHHHH
[5612.13s -> 5614.13s]  What are we doing?
[5621.90s -> 5623.90s]  This is exactly what I was telling you guys.
[5623.90s -> 5625.40s]  It doesn't make sense.
[5625.40s -> 5626.90s]  Remember when I told you support's easy?
[5626.90s -> 5628.40s]  All you have to do
[5628.40s -> 5629.90s]  is be a human.
[5629.90s -> 5631.40s]  Remember when I said that 40 sec-
[5631.40s -> 5633.90s]  or 4 minutes ago before the game started?
[5633.90s -> 5637.72s]  All you have to do to play support is
[5637.72s -> 5640.22s]  think, push buttons, and be active in the game.
[5640.22s -> 5646.45s]  And if you can do those things, you'll get challenger on support.
[5646.45s -> 5648.45s]  Like, it blows my mind.
[5648.45s -> 5650.45s]  Like, look at what she's doing.
[5650.45s -> 5671.75s]  What are you doing?
[5671.75s -> 5673.75s]  This is a forfeit though. I'm gonna lose my mind.
[5673.75s -> 5677.25s]  Auto-filled AD.
[5677.25s -> 5683.19s]  I'm gonna lose it.
[5683.19s -> 5692.32s]  My bad guys.
[5692.32s -> 5694.32s]  I'm an auto-filled AD. I'm just bad.
[5694.32s -> 5704.10s]  It's on me. I apologize.
[5704.10s -> 5706.10s]  Oh man, these players are crazy.
[5706.10s -> 5711.33s]  I'm actually really surprised.
[5711.33s -> 5715.86s]  We're just not forfeiting now.
[5715.86s -> 5717.86s]  The best way to play the game is something that like
[5717.86s -> 5719.86s]  I fall victim to too, where I fuck this up sometimes, right?
[5719.86s -> 5723.84s]  times right but the best way to play the game a lot of the time is you
[5723.84s -> 5730.48s]  essentially don't play to take risks I know it sounds silly because you got to
[5730.48s -> 5740.14s]  find essentially you have to find the my Malzahar just let a let this guy
[5740.14s -> 5748.10s]  this 1000 gold walk away hey mouse if you moved by the way you get 1k gold
[5748.10s -> 5775.94s]  mid isn't hard role I can mid in my sleep it's not ad is easiest role I'm
[5775.94s -> 5791.12s]  ad carry streamer I play ad but Lulu is small brain that was mean Lulu took some
[5791.12s -> 5796.86s]  some crossfire there that she didn't need to take that was my bad that was
[5796.86s -> 5818.62s]  toxic I'll be real I think today is gonna be a mute all kind of day
[5818.62s -> 5823.68s]  listening to low elo players talk about the game and then they think that they're
[5823.68s -> 5826.60s]  right about the game and like how it works and all this shits it actually
[5826.60s -> 5831.30s]  like hurts me like it shouldn't I should just laugh it off but sometimes when I
[5831.30s -> 5833.92s]  see a low elo player talk about how they think the game should be played
[5833.92s -> 5842.41s]  and I just know that they're wrong it actually like physically hurts me it
[5842.41s -> 5856.76s]  does it physically hurts but I should follow my own rule where if you're
[5856.76s -> 5861.64s]  playing with people that aren't as good like they don't see what you see right there there's like
[5861.64s -> 5867.00s]  something where it's better to play safe and scale even on draven it's better to play safe
[5867.00s -> 5878.84s]  and scale than to go for plays in lane uh mainly because if you go for plays in lane and let's
[5878.84s -> 5883.96s]  say your support is not as good as you or your support's not confident in their ability to 2v2
[5883.96s -> 5888.72s]  Right, then you're just gonna lose. So you're like forcing that person to be in an uncomfortable situation
[5889.40s -> 5890.52s]  so
[5890.52s -> 5896.68s]  Like it's hard for me as a player to just play safe when I see the enemy making mistake after mistake
[5896.84s -> 5902.04s]  It's like something that I have trouble like personally working on right just like a personal issue
[5902.52s -> 5906.44s]  Where like I'll see an enemy make a mistake positional wise. I'm like, oh shit
[5906.44s -> 5909.44s]  let's abuse this but a lot of the time the problem that happens is
[5909.44s -> 5912.24s]  is you have somebody who doesn't know
[5912.24s -> 5913.36s]  that that person made a mistake
[5913.36s -> 5915.24s]  or doesn't see the same mistake as me.
[5915.24s -> 5916.46s]  And because there's no comms,
[5916.46s -> 5918.74s]  I can't relate to them that we should fight, right?
[5918.74s -> 5920.18s]  So if I go in and they don't know
[5920.18s -> 5921.60s]  that we should be fighting there,
[5921.60s -> 5927.72s]  I end up dying and it looks, it feels really bad.
[5927.72s -> 5930.38s]  Which is, I mean, my fault.
[5930.38s -> 5931.76s]  It's like a personal thing.
[5931.76s -> 5933.52s]  Cause you can't control your supports.
[5933.52s -> 5935.44s]  You can only control yourself.
[5935.44s -> 5938.24s]  It's just something that like I suck at doing sometimes.
[5939.62s -> 5942.33s]  Right?
[5942.33s -> 5968.22s]  That's just on man. We could actually kill the Zyra now, by the way. She's like 60% HP
[5968.98s -> 5995.73s]  Like we could kill her. What is my Gragas doing? Oh
[5997.37s -> 6006.84s]  He got her though nice bro use W
[6008.28s -> 6010.28s]  Just to see people
[6011.08s -> 6018.24s]  Not to speed people
[6018.24s -> 6029.30s]  That was a good example, too. Oh, well, I just got to get better at doing that where I play safe though
[6029.30s -> 6032.18s]  That's on me. This is a personal thing. I got to get better at
[6032.18s -> 6063.38s]  Oh, man, I think we're warmed up though. What ad carry do you guys want to see next game?
[6064.58s -> 6066.58s]  That was that was a brutal ass game
[6067.46s -> 6069.66s]  I'm gonna be real. That was a brutal ass game
[6071.08s -> 6074.42s]  What ad carry streamer you guys want to see or ad kick stream what ad carry?
[6076.62s -> 6078.30s]  Champion do you guys want to see this game?
[6078.30s -> 6087.14s]  I just goofed up and tried to play too aggressive with a player that wasn't willing to play aggressive that was on me
[6088.72s -> 6091.62s]  That's my bad
[6091.62s -> 6111.25s]  I'll uh, I'll play better this guy this guy goes scion
[6118.16s -> 6121.52s]  Oh never change twitch chat never change
[6140.91s -> 6144.03s]  Well, the thing is is you have I have to change my mindset so like the thing
[6144.35s -> 6146.67s]  Okay, let me explain something. It's like a personal thing with me
[6147.47s -> 6152.27s]  I'm very very very good mechanically at this game. Right? Like it's my best trade is like I have very good mechanics
[6153.39s -> 6155.95s]  So and I also have like an autistic weird brain
[6155.95s -> 6163.47s]  where I can see I have really good pattern recognition so when I see that
[6163.47s -> 6167.71s]  the enemy is fucking up I know that I'm pretty much always gonna be better at
[6167.71s -> 6176.67s]  the 2v2 okay so because I know that I'm always gonna be better at the 2v2 I
[6176.67s -> 6181.63s]  always want to take the fight when I see that they make a mistake like they
[6181.63s -> 6186.47s]  miss a skill shot, or they walk up too far, stuff like that, right? But the
[6186.47s -> 6190.95s]  problem is, when you're bot lane, you have to work with a teammate. And that's part
[6190.95s -> 6193.75s]  of just playing AD carry, right? And if you're in solo queue, you can't always
[6193.75s -> 6201.71s]  duo. So you have to, I have to like train myself to just be okay with them
[6201.75s -> 6206.31s]  making mistakes and us not abusing those mistakes. It's very frustrating
[6206.31s -> 6208.87s]  for me personally, because I'm a perfectionist. So it's very
[6208.87s -> 6211.15s]  frustrating for me to like see this happening. And I'm like, oh, I want to
[6211.15s -> 6215.53s]  abuse this because I know we can but we have to like I have to like tell myself
[6215.53s -> 6219.29s]  not to and to just like not fuck up the wave state not take bad trades and shit
[6219.29s -> 6223.25s]  because every time there's there's more to it too so if like I walk up and I
[6223.25s -> 6226.01s]  take a fight right let's say like when Rakan W'd in when the fiddle
[6226.01s -> 6232.03s]  ganked for example right if I take that fight I'm now banking that fight
[6232.03s -> 6235.89s]  on Lulu also playing correctly right like they they missed all their
[6235.89s -> 6243.89s]  abilities and they fucked up but I also messed like you nobody can play perfectly every game
[6243.89s -> 6248.53s]  like I can't teammates can't nobody can it's league we're all humans right so you have to bank
[6248.53s -> 6252.29s]  when you're doing that on like your teammate being able to know what you want to accomplish
[6252.29s -> 6257.41s]  in that moment in solo queue with no comms and it's really hard like it's it's a really bad
[6257.41s -> 6265.25s]  mindset that I have sometimes but it's hard to get over because like I like the landing phase
[6265.25s -> 6271.79s]  for me is the most fun part of the game. I love landing face because in my opinion landing
[6271.79s -> 6276.45s]  face is like a little mini chess game between the enemy ball in right. It's like a it's
[6276.45s -> 6282.07s]  like a chess game with like mechanics where it's like how how well can like I auto space
[6282.07s -> 6287.03s]  them right. Can I can I space them well. Can I space them like can I by spacing I
[6287.03s -> 6291.47s]  mean can I walk into them trade and not take damage back right. And I'm always thinking
[6291.47s -> 6295.55s]  to myself okay can I do that. I can. And I'm like I want to do this right. And
[6295.55s -> 6298.91s]  then I'll like get somebody to half and then they'll panic and they'll engage on
[6298.91s -> 6303.59s]  me and the problem is though is like I said without comms or without like
[6303.59s -> 6309.07s]  people who are recognizing what you're trying to accomplish sometimes supports
[6309.07s -> 6314.33s]  and junglers people get flustered and it will go badly and it's my fault at
[6314.33s -> 6317.75s]  the end of the day because I'm choosing to that play style of relying on my
[6317.75s -> 6321.99s]  teammates instead of like knowing that I can probably outscale and play better
[6321.99s -> 6326.79s]  late game and just like keep good CS and not die and shit which is what you guys should all do
[6327.83s -> 6332.23s]  and that's what I tell people to do when they ask me how to play ID I tell you like don't die
[6332.23s -> 6337.43s]  scale up get items but like because I've played the game for so long and my favorite part of
[6337.43s -> 6344.07s]  the game is lane phase and like winning lane and playing that little chess game I fuck myself
[6344.07s -> 6349.67s]  over in a lot of games because I'll like you know force fights that like my teammate would
[6349.67s -> 6353.99s]  would have to play well in as well to win and I'll make a mistake or they'll make a
[6353.99s -> 6360.23s]  mistake and we'll just lose the game off it and it's not a good play style right it's
[6360.23s -> 6365.37s]  not a good play style but that's just like something that like I know other people
[6365.37s -> 6369.25s]  probably also have and I'm telling you that like if you want to climb you got to get
[6369.25s -> 6377.33s]  out of that mindset and get into the mindset of like consistency because you can see last
[6377.33s -> 6385.05s]  game for example I just straight up like lost the game off of me trying to fight when
[6385.05s -> 6392.11s]  my support didn't know how to fight or want to fight and we lost the game off it like
[6392.11s -> 6396.71s]  I was too aggro and even though if they did play correctly we win they didn't so we
[6396.71s -> 6403.35s]  lost so it's basically like it's just not like a good it's not a good uh what's the
[6403.35s -> 6417.08s]  what I'm looking for. Strategy. Because last game was my fault. Because I'm good enough at the game
[6417.08s -> 6421.64s]  that I know that I can't play like that if I want to be consistent. And I still played like it,
[6421.64s -> 6430.88s]  so it's my bad. All right, what are we playing this game, boys? We got Rengar, Karma, Jin.
[6432.08s -> 6434.80s]  What do people want to see? Let me see if any of the AD carries people want to see if I
[6434.80s -> 6440.48s]  can play these. I can't play Vayne into this. Vayne would be way too hard in the Karma,
[6440.48s -> 6451.14s]  and I would just get zoned off the wave.
[6451.14s -> 6452.34s]  I could play Ophelios.
[6453.52s -> 6459.66s]  This is actually a good Ophelios game.
[6459.66s -> 6461.32s]  You know what kind of sucks?
[6461.32s -> 6463.90s]  I feel kind of bad playing Ophelios
[6463.90s -> 6466.48s]  when I'm on my like teaching accounts.
[6466.48s -> 6468.52s]  Like this account I like teach you guys.
[6468.52s -> 6470.62s]  I feel bad playing Ophelios sometimes.
[6472.14s -> 6473.76s]  Because I know a lot of people
[6473.76s -> 6477.30s]  don't want to learn Ophelios or play Ophelios
[6477.30s -> 6478.98s]  because he is like really,
[6480.62s -> 6482.06s]  he's very unique.
[6482.90s -> 6488.16s]  But he's he's hard to learn for a lot of people so I feel I always feel kind of bad doing it
[6489.34s -> 6490.98s]  right
[6490.98s -> 6495.78s]  But I'll be real. I don't know in this specific situation outside of like jinx. I
[6497.14s -> 6499.14s]  Didn't really know what else to pick
[6499.90s -> 6504.30s]  Like jinx is good kaisa is probably okay, but you still get zoned off the wave on kaisa
[6504.82s -> 6513.76s]  Cuz like if we if we look at this, right?
[6514.36s -> 6517.43s]  uh
[6517.43s -> 6522.95s]  Kai'Sa would have been I guess okay, but when you're picking a champion for bot lane, right?
[6524.15s -> 6527.91s]  When you're picking a champion for bot lane, uh, one thing that you guys should think about when
[6527.91s -> 6531.03s]  picking like what you know, what champion you want to play unless you're a one trick and then
[6531.03s -> 6534.63s]  play whatever you want. But if you're like somebody who wants to actually like play the
[6534.63s -> 6542.72s]  meta and learn why champions are meta and when to pick what they picked Jin Karma. Now
[6543.76s -> 6549.20s]  we have a Lulu if we had something with a hook like a Nautilus, a Blitz, a Thresh,
[6549.20s -> 6553.92s]  Pike like if we had something like that, I could pick a low-range fighter, right?
[6554.28s -> 6556.56s]  Like I could pick a low-range fighter if we had a hook champ
[6557.76s -> 6563.52s]  But because we don't have a hook champ and we have an enchanter I have to pick something that can safely
[6564.12s -> 6569.84s]  Consistently farm and not get zoned off by their bot lane. So there's not a lot of options that can do that
[6570.24s -> 6573.70s]  There's like I didn't want to pick you could pick Ezreal here
[6573.70s -> 6577.14s]  It's not the worst but we had a Lulu so I didn't want to pick Ezreal because Lulu goes to waste
[6577.14s -> 6582.14s]  So it's like you could pick Jinx, but I kind of didn't want to pick Jinx this game because Jinx bores the shit out of me right now.
[6582.14s -> 6588.14s]  So this would be a good Jinx game though, if you guys are curious, like this would be a completely fine Jinx game.
[6588.14s -> 6596.46s]  Your E stops Rengar jump. You can follow up really easily with Lulu. Like this would be a good Jinx game.
[6596.46s -> 6603.46s]  But Aphelios, it's a good Aphelios game too. It's both. It's got Aphelios game, good Jinx game.
[6603.46s -> 6618.46s]  Jankx
[6618.46s -> 6625.98s]  Trist is unique because you only pick Tristana if you plan on winning lane.
[6625.98s -> 6630.38s]  Tristana doesn't actually scale better than Jinx in any way.
[6632.08s -> 6634.08s]  Like she does not have a better scaling than Jinx.
[6634.88s -> 6636.88s]  Trist versus Jinx, three items.
[6637.18s -> 6639.98s]  Jinx wins every time in teamfights, no matter what.
[6640.78s -> 6642.98s]  Like she just does what Trist does better.
[6645.18s -> 6647.68s]  Now, the reason you pick Trist is because you do want to win lane.
[6647.68s -> 6650.68s]  You want to like jump in, you want to kill them, you want to be aggressive, right?
[6650.88s -> 6653.38s]  So that's what you're picking Trist for, is that I get kills in lane.
[6653.78s -> 6659.18s]  The problem is is again what we were just talking about right? Let's say I picked Trist to get kills in lane now
[6659.18s -> 6665.92s]  Let's say my my support doesn't want to be aggressive and let's say like the Jaina and the Karma have a really good push
[6666.42s -> 6671.46s]  Okay, something that Trist is really weak at is being pushed in right?
[6671.46s -> 6676.98s]  That's one of her weakest things because she has she struggles especially early game. She struggles quite a bit on farming under turret
[6677.82s -> 6679.82s]  so let's say
[6680.62s -> 6686.68s]  It's just like a coin flippy pick you could pick Trist if you had like a support duo for sure
[6687.26s -> 6691.40s]  Into into Jin Trist is amazing into Jin. It's one of Jin's hardest actual counters
[6691.78s -> 6694.64s]  But again, it's not about countering the champion
[6694.64s -> 6698.90s]  it's about countering the lane and what the lane is going to do to you and and being able to play around that and
[6699.54s -> 6705.46s]  This lane is a shoveling Jin karma doesn't fight you they poke you and shove waves in that's what they do
[6705.46s -> 6708.56s]  They're a prio lane. So they're just gonna shove and shove and shove, right?
[6708.56s -> 6710.92s]  So because they're just gonna shove and shove and shove
[6710.92s -> 6716.00s]  I need to play something that isn't gonna have issues playing under turret or something that can shove back if I need to
[6717.08s -> 6726.40s]  Right, which is why Jinx a fairly else are both good as real again would just get shoved in stuff like that
[6726.40s -> 6730.20s]  Right. Yeah, these are things you actually have to think about when you're playing the game for certain
[6731.00s -> 6732.20s]  champions
[6732.20s -> 6734.84s]  It's certain matchups because a lot of the time
[6735.42s -> 6740.12s]  People will pick a champion that's meta and they won't understand why they're still losing the matchup
[6740.12s -> 6742.28s]  even though they're good at that champion.
[6742.28s -> 6744.44s]  And it's just that you're not bad at the champ.
[6744.44s -> 6746.28s]  The matchup is just unplayable.
[6746.28s -> 6749.40s]  You could put Faker, Doublelift,
[6749.40s -> 6751.32s]  fucking Gumiase in certain matchups
[6751.32s -> 6752.32s]  and they will just lose.
[6752.32s -> 6753.64s]  They will lose the matchups.
[6753.64s -> 6756.88s]  And it's because no matter how good your mechanics are,
[6756.88s -> 6758.60s]  if the matchup is played correctly,
[6758.60s -> 6761.38s]  it's not winnable.
[6761.38s -> 6762.82s]  And that's why you see in pro play,
[6762.82s -> 6763.94s]  drafting is so important.
[6763.94s -> 6765.74s]  It's a perfect example of why in pro play,
[6765.74s -> 6767.94s]  drafting is 10 times more important than solo queue.
[6767.94s -> 6769.94s]  And it's because when everybody plays the matchups
[6769.94s -> 6775.31s]  correctly and shit right when everybody's playing the matchups correctly and shits
[6775.31s -> 6781.11s]  the matchup like skill becomes a thousand times more important or like
[6781.11s -> 6784.93s]  you know how the matchups being played like the champions become way more
[6784.93s -> 6790.05s]  important whoa what the fuck my monitor just fucked up what the hell is going
[6790.05s -> 6798.25s]  on another little tip for you guys who I fucked that but another little tip
[6798.25s -> 6811.96s]  for you guys is melee champions or melee minions take one turret shot two
[6811.96s -> 6817.81s]  autos or sorry two turrets shots one auto and casters take one auto one turret shot
[6819.57s -> 6824.85s]  when you're under turrets like luck okay so learning uh this would be actually a pretty
[6824.85s -> 6828.29s]  good game to explain to you how to farm under the turret actually i was thinking about like
[6828.29s -> 6830.85s]  what i could teach you guys because we're just gonna get shoved in a lot this game
[6832.61s -> 6842.68s]  it's actually not that bad though uh so right now we could actually space forward here
[6842.68s -> 6859.37s]  Okay, that did not hit me that was BS, but sure I did the same thing I did last game man. I
[6860.69s -> 6862.85s]  Did the same thing you said I walked up
[6863.93s -> 6868.61s]  It wasn't it was a good fight. But again, I keep doing that
[6868.61s -> 6872.17s]  We're like I see the fight and I'll take the fight because I know it's a good fight
[6873.05s -> 6879.04s]  But Lulu was too far back. So I ended up just inting. It's really stupid
[6881.47s -> 6899.54s]  like I was such a dumb play by me because I had to blow both my sums right there because
[6899.56s -> 6904.76s]  uh the jinn or i mean the jinn was in a really bad spot and the karma was in a really bad spot
[6904.76s -> 6908.12s]  because i was level three and they were level two and they were walking up to contest waves
[6909.08s -> 6915.16s]  but my uh lulu was behind me and when you're playing you know solo queue you have to play
[6915.16s -> 6926.48s]  as a team with your teammate okay so this jinn is kind of griefing right now he's griefing
[6926.48s -> 6936.32s]  by like walking up when i'm blue gunning him i don't know what lulu is doing oh she's killing
[6936.32s -> 6940.64s]  That guy nice. Yeah, they're they're grieving really hard. So the blue guns OP for what you just saw
[6941.52s -> 6945.60s]  All you have to do with the blue gun if you really want to just like have a funny ass overpowered fucking
[6947.20s -> 6958.85s]  When they're farming under the turret like that just hit the minions. Okay, we're getting ganked
[6960.53s -> 6966.76s]  Back up
[6966.76s -> 6970.60s]  So I kind of did a cardinal sin there. I would say like a sin of like
[6971.56s -> 6973.56s]  I overstayed a bit. I think
[6973.56s -> 6976.88s]  Oh, okay, we'll fuck off dude
[6978.64s -> 6980.94s]  That was greedy I should have backed out the turret
[6980.94s -> 6985.60s]  But I didn't think karma was actually knew that but I did overstay because you can see like this is the perfect example
[6985.60s -> 6987.96s]  of why I overstayed so they stopped my back, right I
[6988.92s -> 6991.52s]  Can give you guys a really good example of what just happened. I
[6992.64s -> 6993.96s]  overstayed and
[6993.96s -> 6996.34s]  When I overstayed I didn't actually get anything out of it
[6996.48s -> 6999.64s]  Like I got what you saw I just have extra gold for nothing
[6999.64s -> 7005.74s]  So now I just have extra gold right and because I have extra gold the Jhin actually gets a net positive because they stop to
[7005.74s -> 7010.26s]  My back so he gets a free plate here. I miss a cannon and even though I'm still up 10 CS
[7010.78s -> 7014.80s]  It's like I could have been up 10 CS not given a plate and not
[7015.30s -> 7018.26s]  Missed a cannon so it's it's basically like
[7019.78s -> 7031.38s]  It's interesting should you get Pryo for your jungle every game? No, no, that's not important some games Pryo is important
[7031.38s -> 7035.86s]  It's very important in some games, but you don't need to always be thinking about getting
[7035.86s -> 7038.10s]  prio for your jungler.
[7038.10s -> 7040.82s]  That's not something you should be thinking about always, right?
[7040.82s -> 7043.66s]  You think about it in terms of timers.
[7043.66s -> 7049.46s]  That's important, but prio for jungler always is not something you should be worrying
[7049.46s -> 7054.96s]  about.
[7054.96s -> 7057.96s]  Because if you're perma shoving and you're like, oh, I have prio for my jungler,
[7057.96s -> 7062.36s]  but then your jungler doesn't do anything, having that prio, you don't have prio.
[7062.36s -> 7065.81s]  It doesn't do anything.
[7065.81s -> 7102.32s]  rather hold the wave in like a certain spot. Oh my god I suck. I mean it worked
[7102.32s -> 7110.32s]  out. I think if I was six I triple kill them there but I think we actually
[7110.32s -> 7114.28s]  almost I think we actually triple kill them too if Lulu helped me but again
[7114.28s -> 7160.66s]  you guys know what I'm gonna say I go back to the thing. I don't know if
[7160.66s -> 7183.27s]  Rengar has ulti or not. I want to shove this because chill. I want to
[7183.27s -> 7187.99s]  it in for a second and I really don't have anything to do so I'll just stand here. You want to also be
[7187.99s -> 7193.67s]  backed once it's hit for when to buy boots. I bought boots. Aphelios you can buy boots really
[7193.67s -> 7199.11s]  early. He's like he's a champion where the more attacks you do is actually very valuable and
[7199.11s -> 7204.79s]  positioning on Aphelios is very important. It's kind of like some ad carries like you don't need
[7204.79s -> 7210.23s]  boots really early like like with like Jinx for example I usually go free boots right or I go
[7210.23s -> 7217.83s]  boots like after my Kraken but with Aphelios I really like the early mobility the early trading
[7218.55s -> 7227.91s]  stuff like that's okay so always be watching the map too we see that Rengar's top right
[7228.63s -> 7241.89s]  we can actually just straight fight these guys 2v2 right now uh what wait what what's my Lulu
[7241.89s -> 7261.51s]  doing homie what what are we he's ulting us so you're saying helping the ad carry is bad got it
[7268.84s -> 7275.72s]  i can't believe my lulu just walked away from me and just like watched like you work as a team
[7277.24s -> 7286.21s]  this is something that i cannot stress enough play as a team when you play league of legends
[7286.21s -> 7290.21s]  This tilts me more than anything because this happens even in Grandmaster.
[7290.21s -> 7294.21s]  I see teammates who will be selfish and not help each other.
[7294.21s -> 7297.21s]  Just help each other.
[7297.21s -> 7300.21s]  Help each other. Please man.
[7300.21s -> 7303.97s]  We are a team.
[7303.97s -> 7306.97s]  Don't just run and leave your ADC.
[7306.97s -> 7312.99s]  Like I'm not even flaming you but like dude you can't do that.
[7312.99s -> 7317.99s]  You can't be upset that like I can't dodge every spell.
[7317.99s -> 7319.91s]  Welcome to the League of Dreams.
[7319.91s -> 7321.67s]  I feel like something that I notice that happens a lot
[7321.67s -> 7324.87s]  in League now is players will have this weirdly
[7324.87s -> 7327.75s]  high expectation for everyone to play
[7327.75s -> 7329.79s]  absolutely perfect at all times.
[7330.83s -> 7333.95s]  And they want me to like be Gumiase.
[7333.95s -> 7337.39s]  And I'm like, dude, I dodged two of the gin bullets.
[7337.39s -> 7338.75s]  I dodged a Karma Q.
[7339.85s -> 7341.91s]  Like you literally, like I can't dodge
[7341.91s -> 7343.39s]  literally everything while slowed, right?
[7343.39s -> 7353.00s]  Like that's not how it works.
[7353.00s -> 7355.80s]  Like, dude, I'm gonna lose my mind with this guy.
[7385.33s -> 7392.39s]  My Lulu is blaming me.
[7392.39s -> 7395.26s]  It's okay.
[7395.26s -> 7396.28s]  It's okay.
[7396.28s -> 7397.70s]  I don't need to be upset.
[7398.70s -> 7399.54s]  It's fine.
[7400.42s -> 7408.96s]  The Lulu player is totally okay.
[7408.96s -> 7412.32s]  You know, sometimes people think they're right.
[7412.32s -> 7423.95s]  It's just what happens in the worlds, right?
[7423.95s -> 7425.95s]  Right? It's just...
[7425.95s -> 7427.59s]  It is what it is.
[7427.59s -> 7442.08s]  No big deal.
[7442.08s -> 7445.68s]  Sorry, I'm trying really hard to not be an asshole right now.
[7445.68s -> 7448.44s]  This Lulu player is making me like...
[7448.44s -> 7450.24s]  Making me one of like fun Thanos.
[7450.24s -> 7453.44s]  You know what I mean? Like this guy is like making me...
[7453.44s -> 7455.84s]  Like this guy... Like we talk about...
[7455.84s -> 7460.00s]  We... Like in League, we talk about like the players...
[7460.00s -> 7463.04s]  Like we talk about AD carry players having ego.
[7463.04s -> 7465.40s]  I genuinely think...
[7465.40s -> 7471.32s]  support players have five times the ego ad carry players have, but with like a third of the skill.
[7475.28s -> 7482.20s]  I think ad carry players do have massive egos, but again, I don't think that like,
[7483.00s -> 7487.56s]  I think support players are genuinely the dumbest motherfucking humans on the planet,
[7488.12s -> 7490.60s]  and they think that they're the best players to ever touch the game,
[7491.32s -> 7519.96s]  and it hurts my fucking balls. Hey Lulu, would you be willing to have a
[7521.48s -> 7528.84s]  VOD review with me in discord after the game. Let's just see. I want to see if like this person
[7528.84s -> 7559.47s]  is willing to listen to reason. Let's see. I'm trying to not tilt but it's really frustrating
[7561.07s -> 7567.07s]  because this player is playing specifically for KDA and they're playing like they don't
[7567.07s -> 7571.71s]  understand how like I can already tell you if I go look at this person's op.gg
[7571.71s -> 7579.39s]  They only play for KDA. I can tell you right now right here. This person plays only for KDA never takes any risks
[7579.95s -> 7584.27s]  Doesn't ever help their ad carry ever when they get behind doesn't ever walk up to like
[7584.75s -> 7586.51s]  Try and fight doesn't do any of that
[7586.51s -> 7590.19s]  I can tell you right now without even looking at their op.gg from how this person plays
[7590.75s -> 7593.71s]  That they have high KDAs, but really low win rate
[7598.40s -> 7602.80s]  But I don't want my entire stream to be bitching about this Lulu. So we'll try and focus on how to win from this position
[7602.80s -> 7607.86s]  So I'm sure you guys get shitty supports too. So we'll try and focus on how to win from the current position. We're in
[7619.93s -> 7625.15s]  Yeah, it doesn't get better. I mean, I'll be honest with you. My grandmaster supports on my main suck
[7625.15s -> 7633.15s]  Like it doesn't get better. They get better like mechanically at the game, right? Like the higher elo supports get better mechanically
[7633.59s -> 7636.37s]  but they get work they don't get better when like
[7637.23s -> 7641.71s]  It doesn't get better. It's always like you'll either have a really good support or you have somebody who sniffs glue
[7641.71s -> 7674.16s]  I'm just dead or I'm not dead. Okay, uh
[7676.86s -> 7680.90s]  Honestly, our biggest issue here is I need to get blood thirster ASAP
[7681.42s -> 7683.42s]  Once I get BT the game gets a lot easier
[7683.98s -> 7694.20s]  We could kill this guy right now
[7694.40s -> 7697.12s]  If the Lulu helps me we can actually just straight kill these guys
[7698.04s -> 7703.32s]  Because I can ulti to heal myself right we have Lulu ult I have ult to heal myself and I'm strong
[7704.44s -> 7707.92s]  She has ignite. I have ult. I have everything right we could easily
[7709.56s -> 7711.68s]  Kill that that Taliyah right there. I
[7713.48s -> 7715.48s]  Mean yeah, whatever man
[7715.56s -> 7717.56s]  This is what I'm talking about
[7721.24s -> 7722.72s]  again
[7722.72s -> 7728.24s]  Are you willing to get into discord and vod review? Yes or no?
[7728.24s -> 7738.72s]  I mean I have to be honest with you
[7739.28s -> 7747.00s]  The reason this is frustrating is because as an ad carry player you want to be able to rely on your support, right?
[7747.00s -> 7751.60s]  But you want to be able to make plays, go in, fight, and rely on your teammates.
[7751.60s -> 7754.80s]  Because as an AD carry player, support an AD or like a duo, right?
[7754.80s -> 7756.40s]  Like you want to play together.
[7756.40s -> 7758.64s]  No, no, man.
[7758.64s -> 7760.60s]  I'm not attacking you.
[7760.60s -> 7764.62s]  I'm saying let's discord after.
[7764.62s -> 7776.02s]  You can explain your POV and I'll explain mine.
[7776.02s -> 7778.84s]  Maybe we can like improve this player.
[7778.84s -> 7784.34s]  Like get them to be a better player and not ruin every game they play in.
[7784.34s -> 7786.34s]  Like that would be that would be the goat
[7791.00s -> 7794.36s]  Like the that did not hit me by the way that hip-hop should be s but
[7803.96s -> 7805.96s]  I don't even understand
[7810.08s -> 7816.96s]  Oh, man
[7816.96s -> 7821.49s]  This is the person's
[7821.65s -> 7823.75s]  By the way, this is the person's opi.gg
[7825.09s -> 7826.45s]  Average win rate
[7826.45s -> 7830.29s]  50 win rate, like I said has really good kda's on all his champs
[7831.97s -> 7834.93s]  But he doesn't win
[7834.93s -> 7836.93s]  i'm telling you right now
[7836.93s -> 7841.01s]  The biggest thing in league that the fakest thing in the league of legends
[7841.89s -> 7844.69s]  Is believing that you are a good player based on kda
[7846.37s -> 7851.49s]  If I go look at any challenger level support player right now their kda's will be like
[7852.53s -> 7854.37s]  four
[7854.37s -> 7857.97s]  They'll still have good kda, but it'll be like four and three and it'll be on
[7859.49s -> 7862.77s]  That's your mutual i'm gonna be real with you right now t
[7863.97s -> 7865.89s]  this lulu player
[7865.89s -> 7872.85s]  Like you could tell me that this person sniffed glue as a kid and their parents never told them to stop and I would believe you
[7873.97s -> 7875.97s]  I'm not even meaning like I would say that makes sense
[7877.49s -> 7880.53s]  I mean like I said, I don't even care. I don't care if it's a girl a guy
[7881.09s -> 7884.77s]  The e-girl thing is like that doesn't bother me right? Like like it could be a girl a guy a pigeon
[7885.01s -> 7887.01s]  They could they could fucking
[7887.09s -> 7893.01s]  They could relate as a fucking peanut in a in a fucking plane. I don't care about that at all
[7896.23s -> 7898.23s]  You know what I mean? Like say that shit doesn't bother me at all
[7899.19s -> 7905.21s]  Like then be like I actually think it's stupid when people are like, oh, it's an e-girl e-guy like I think that's dumb
[7905.21s -> 7907.71s]  It's shit because that arguments so crap
[7908.19s -> 7911.59s]  Cuz like I don't give a shit if it's a guy or girl because like, you know what?
[7911.59s -> 7915.05s]  I mean, I'm more upset at the fact that this person is delusional than anything
[7915.87s -> 7929.98s]  That's like what's tilting me here. I'm just gonna mute
[7930.58s -> 7935.46s]  We'll do one more game on this account after this game and I'm gonna mute from the start of the game for you guys
[7935.46s -> 7942.36s]  Okay
[7942.36s -> 7945.24s]  Dude if he didn't actually get me into the wall there
[7945.24s -> 7949.52s]  I tried to walk forward so that I wouldn't get condemned in the wall if he didn't stun me. I kill him
[7950.36s -> 7952.36s]  That's annoying
[7952.64s -> 7956.04s]  That was actually such a good hitbox for him my bad
[7970.33s -> 7975.57s]  Nice huge shutdown. Nice job. If you're wondering why I'm even here, by the way, I'm actually I'm not trolling
[7975.89s -> 7979.93s]  I'm trying to get this turret because this gives me a lot of gold at the moment
[7979.93s -> 7984.73s]  I'm not actually worth that much gold. There's nothing going on on the map. There's no objective or anything like that, right?
[7984.73s -> 7987.77s]  So I'm trying to push in top waves right now so that I can get gold
[7989.25s -> 7992.45s]  To try and like hyper inflate my two item before this next dragon
[7993.01s -> 7997.17s]  Because this next dragon is gonna be incredibly important if we if we want any chance to win
[7998.01s -> 8000.01s]  we have to win that this next dragon and
[8000.49s -> 8003.93s]  the only way for me to do that is to either get really lucky or
[8005.19s -> 8007.19s]  Go get some gold in a sideline
[8007.53s -> 8012.01s]  It's just support difference every game. It is I want to point this out
[8012.01s -> 8018.33s]  This person is playing this victim complex bullshit. Like you know what I mean? But it is it is actually support death
[8019.05s -> 8057.21s]  Sorry, I'm tilted. I'm playing bad this game. I
[8058.69s -> 8061.69s]  Need to mute these players because these players are actually tilting me
[8063.09s -> 8066.81s]  Like I was fine with it before but I'm actually getting a little irritated that's making me play bad
[8067.65s -> 8069.97s]  So I need to mute them so I don't keep inting
[8070.73s -> 8074.75s]  Like it's affecting my gameplay and it's pissing me off
[8075.47s -> 8078.43s]  That's just my bad
[8078.43s -> 8087.69s]  T split are you here T?
[8088.09s -> 8094.15s]  Yo T, message this Lulu. I mean this in the nicest way. I don't even want to be
[8094.15s -> 8102.21s]  toxic. I genuinely want to use this for content. Like this guy's been flaming me
[8102.21s -> 8106.69s]  the whole game. Like I want to use this for content to show you guys that it is
[8106.69s -> 8111.49s]  so easy to tell people how the game should be played. So easy if you if you
[8111.49s -> 8118.23s]  can communicate by talking. Because this guy's been doing nothing but
[8118.23s -> 8124.13s]  flaming me the entire game. This Lulu, right? But he's an absolute, like he played the lane
[8124.13s -> 8130.23s]  completely bad. Then he, then he stopped trying to win. Stop shielding me, stop doing anything,
[8130.23s -> 8135.55s]  right? After he played the lane bad. Then he started playing the victim thing when I
[8135.55s -> 8139.03s]  asked him to be a human and like come over and like help me and play teamwork. You
[8139.03s -> 8142.55s]  gotta remember, I didn't flame him a single time, right? Like I didn't say a single
[8142.55s -> 8150.97s]  negative thing to this guy in game. I said, let's work as a team. He got upset.
[8150.97s -> 8156.81s]  I genuinely think it'd be great content if I could talk to this guy in discord and just like oh, I'd be so good
[8173.56s -> 8176.88s]  Right, dude. I'm I'm trying to kill these people guys
[8177.68s -> 8184.32s]  That wasn't bad though. We got 800 gold not the worst, but I don't know if my team can stall this
[8185.10s -> 8187.34s]  maybe if they can like kill this they can stall it but
[8191.56s -> 8195.92s]  Nah, they're yeah, that's that's GG. That was disgusting tallia W
[8196.68s -> 8238.04s]  All right, I'm gonna add him and he'll probably not add me but I might as well try
[8238.04s -> 8255.17s]  This would be such a good learning experience. Oh, excuse me, dude. I've had like bad heartburn today
[8255.17s -> 8262.19s]  I need to take one of those heartburn pills
[8262.29s -> 8265.49s]  What Lulu what man just say I just let it out
[8266.13s -> 8271.61s]  Let it out. Let it out, baby. Yo
[8272.73s -> 8280.43s]  Lulu, let's just just have a talk. Yo
[8281.13s -> 8283.13s]  Let's discord
[8283.29s -> 8285.29s]  We can bottom of you
[8285.81s -> 8291.11s]  Since I'm so bad. Yeah
[8297.35s -> 8303.79s]  Trust you you just
[8305.15s -> 8307.91s]  Blamed everyone by yourself
[8308.59s -> 8317.80s]  But you didn't play correctly at all you played lane completely wrong
[8319.52s -> 8325.18s]  Didn't help each other left people to die on repeats
[8326.78s -> 8366.62s]  Then played victim I genuinely want to help you this guy
[8366.62s -> 8382.86s]  I screenshotted what I just said and put it in the end game chat.
[8382.86s -> 8385.34s]  What is happening right now?
[8385.34s -> 8388.50s]  What is going on?
[8388.50s -> 8400.18s]  There is no way that this is not an NPC.
[8400.18s -> 8404.78s]  There is no way this is not an NPC.
[8404.78s -> 8407.84s]  There's no way.
[8407.84s -> 8414.80s]  There's no way.
[8414.80s -> 8417.68s]  It's Geronimo Lamau.
[8417.68s -> 8419.92s]  It is me, yes.
[8419.92s -> 8422.46s]  Bro, just come talk in Discord.
[8422.46s -> 8430.35s]  I'm not even gonna flame you.
[8430.35s -> 8431.95s]  What does this even mean?
[8431.95s -> 8440.78s]  Bro, I don't think I've seen anybody more insecure in my life.
[8440.78s -> 8445.36s]  Bro, you are so insecure.
[8445.36s -> 8451.25s]  It's cringe how insecure you are.
[8451.25s -> 8453.93s]  Like oof.
[8453.93s -> 8464.71s]  Good luck, man, on the climb to Masters, but Jesus Christ.
[8464.71s -> 8467.60s]  That's sad.
[8467.60s -> 8468.60s]  Oh, God.
[8468.60s -> 8473.00s]  I, dude, I don't even know what to say, like, I'm gonna be real.
[8473.00s -> 8475.36s]  I wasn't, like, I'm not even gonna flame the guy, right?
[8475.36s -> 8481.34s]  I just genuinely want to, like, improve the community.
[8481.34s -> 8486.06s]  Because that was three straight supports in a row that didn't know how to play Lulu.
[8486.06s -> 8488.22s]  And I'm not even gonna flame the guy's skill.
[8488.22s -> 8489.22s]  He's not a Lulu player, right?
[8489.22s -> 8490.30s]  He doesn't play Lulu.
[8490.30s -> 8491.44s]  That's fine.
[8491.44s -> 8497.12s]  But the issue was that I had with that guy specifically was that it's okay to be bad
[8497.12s -> 8498.78s]  at the game, right?
[8498.78s -> 8501.06s]  There's nothing wrong with being bad at League.
[8501.06s -> 8502.46s]  Everybody has bad games.
[8502.46s -> 8505.50s]  But when we're playing a game together and you're saying it's winnable and you want
[8505.50s -> 8512.18s]  to win the game, you can't pick and choose who to like help win the game.
[8512.18s -> 8516.98s]  Like if I'm sitting there bot lane, we're both being dove by Jhin and you're intentionally
[8516.98s -> 8523.30s]  trying not to take damage and not die because you want to value your KDA over everything else
[8524.10s -> 8530.02s]  so that I you know what hold on let me think about this I think I figured this person out
[8531.70s -> 8535.62s]  this person lives in delusion and I think I figured this out let me let me explain this
[8535.62s -> 8538.74s]  a lot of players do this but I think I'm figuring this out as I'm as I'm thinking
[8538.74s -> 8545.30s]  about this so this person has really good KDAs on their profile right this like this
[8545.30s -> 8548.34s]  eye-catching person. They've really really good KDAs in the profile, right?
[8549.30s -> 8556.02s]  This person doesn't ever take risks, doesn't ever do anything to try and win the game outside of
[8556.02s -> 8563.76s]  like just existing and hitting buttons. And what they do is they will always have good KDAs
[8564.64s -> 8569.04s]  and they will they will sit here and never like I know why they're losing. They will sit here
[8569.04s -> 8572.72s]  and they will do this shit where they have good KDAs they they don't ever die that much
[8572.72s -> 8578.56s]  blah blah blah. But what they do is they lie to themselves and they say look how good my KDAs are.
[8579.36s -> 8589.92s]  If I had better teammates I'd always win. Like I cracked the code actually. That's totally what it
[8589.92s -> 8596.96s]  is. The players actually like play so safe and they play to like for statistics right. They
[8596.96s -> 8602.40s]  play like purely for the stats and then they can say that it was their team's fault that
[8602.40s -> 8606.60s]  that they didn't win, because they played really bad,
[8606.60s -> 8612.54s]  but they didn't die.
[8612.54s -> 8615.54s]  Because I mean, in theory, I could have a perfect KDA
[8615.54s -> 8618.06s]  on every AD carry I play, right?
[8618.06s -> 8621.46s]  All I'd have to do is literally walk up, get one kill,
[8621.46s -> 8625.70s]  and then AFK and stand in the base the rest of the game.
[8625.70s -> 8626.54s]  And I could be like,
[8626.54s -> 8627.62s]  yo, why is my team not able to carry?
[8627.62s -> 8631.45s]  What's happening?
[8631.45s -> 8632.41s]  Right?
[8632.41s -> 8633.97s]  Like, you could literally do that.
[8633.97s -> 8635.41s]  No, I seriously think the person's
[8635.41s -> 8636.73s]  self-gaslighting himself.
[8638.09s -> 8638.93s]  Like, I'm serious.
[8638.93s -> 8641.93s]  I think this person's like self-gaslighting where they're like,
[8641.93s -> 8644.07s]  oh, it's my team's fault every game, right?
[8644.07s -> 8646.81s]  Like they're always blaming their team for their loses
[8646.81s -> 8648.29s]  and their mistakes and shit.
[8648.29s -> 8651.77s]  And it's sad because like, there's a reason you're D2.
[8651.77s -> 8653.17s]  And I'm not saying that to be toxic.
[8653.17s -> 8655.93s]  I'm saying that like you haven't improved in four years
[8655.93s -> 8657.45s]  and you haven't improved because all you're doing
[8657.45s -> 8659.75s]  is playing to blame your team every single game.
[8659.75s -> 8662.49s]  When I just saw like 500 mistakes that you made
[8662.49s -> 8671.64s]  that we could have won the game off of early game.
[8671.64s -> 8672.94s]  Here, I remember somebody wanted me
[8672.94s -> 8674.98s]  to play a Caitlyn game last game.
[8674.98s -> 8677.82s]  So we're going to play Cait.
[8677.82s -> 8679.66s]  I don't remember who it was in the chat.
[8679.66s -> 8681.70s]  Somebody, like two people said Cait.
[8681.70s -> 8684.22s]  But we'll do a Cait game for you guys.
[8684.22s -> 8703.31s]  I got you boys, don't worry.
[8703.31s -> 8706.11s]  All right, I'm going to take Ghost Flash
[8706.11s -> 8708.43s]  because they have three melee champs, four melee champs.
[8708.43s -> 8710.43s]  They have Rakan, Zed, Kled, Gragas.
[8710.43s -> 8712.23s]  So I'm going to take Ghost Flash.
[8713.39s -> 8715.27s]  These are going to be my runes this game.
[8715.27s -> 8716.31s]  I'm going to take a little more MR
[8716.31s -> 8717.59s]  because I don't think we're going to be fighting
[8717.59s -> 8718.75s]  too much in lane.
[8718.75s -> 8720.91s]  We're pretty much just going to be poking them
[8720.91s -> 8722.53s]  with KarmaKate.
[8722.53s -> 8723.73s]  So I'm gonna take a little bit of extra MMR
[8723.73s -> 8725.43s]  cause I'm gonna be playing for mid delay game.
[8725.43s -> 8726.27s]  I'm just scaling.
[8727.93s -> 8737.39s]  And these are gonna be the runes that I take.
[8737.39s -> 8740.63s]  Giving classes on AD Carry or the easier to play ones.
[8740.63s -> 8742.67s]  In AD Carry, I usually do,
[8742.67s -> 8744.11s]  like when I'm playing on this account right now,
[8744.11s -> 8746.27s]  this is like my teaching account.
[8746.27s -> 8747.55s]  It's a little lower MMR, right?
[8747.55s -> 8749.33s]  It's like D1 low masters.
[8749.33s -> 8752.49s]  I usually play AD Carries
[8752.49s -> 8754.35s]  that like the chat wants to see me play
[8754.35s -> 8756.55s]  so that you guys can learn like good and bad matchups
[8756.55s -> 8757.75s]  and things like that.
[8758.43s -> 8764.43s]  The last two games, I got way too tilted by shitty support players, like egos and all that shit.
[8764.43s -> 8767.43s]  I got way too frustrated and I played bad the last two games.
[8767.43s -> 8772.43s]  So, we're gonna... Honestly, I think I'm just gonna mute these people at the very start of the game.
[8772.43s -> 8778.43s]  Normally, I wouldn't suggest you mute people because, like, playing as a team is really important.
[8778.43s -> 8783.43s]  Because, like, you know, you need to communicate and all that shit, but I am just, like, I'm gonna mute them.
[8783.43s -> 8785.43s]  because I
[8785.75s -> 8789.91s]  Dude, my mental is taking a fucking hit right now. So we're gonna just chill and play. I
[8793.57s -> 8798.55s]  Just don't know how to play Naila. I think that was really good. I just thought I don't know how to play her. I
[8799.97s -> 8806.46s]  Think she's a great champ like I've been getting shit on by Naila on my main account
[8807.78s -> 8822.58s]  Like a lot of grandmaster Naila's have been dumpstering me. I think she's just really good at abusing solo queue
[8823.54s -> 8825.54s]  like the the issue with Naila is
[8825.54s -> 8828.62s]  is from what I've seen, all the losses I've had with Nailah,
[8829.16s -> 8832.44s]  people don't, um, it's like the thing I was telling you about before,
[8832.84s -> 8835.04s]  people don't play aggressively
[8835.18s -> 8837.86s]  in the lower ELOs, like, uh, even in Grandmaster,
[8837.86s -> 8841.40s]  people don't play, like, aggressively enough, it sounds crazy to say that, but it's true,
[8841.50s -> 8845.06s]  they don't play aggressively enough in lane, so you can get away with just picking Nailah,
[8845.06s -> 8848.16s]  and scaling, and Nailah at, like, one item,
[8848.16s -> 8851.16s]  you'll always be up in levels, right, because that's how the champion works.
[8852.04s -> 8855.32s]  The champion works in like you'll always be up in levels because of her passive
[8855.32s -> 8862.72s]  So you basically just like scale through existing. It's pretty it's pretty interesting
[8864.12s -> 8870.29s]  All right, so we're playing Kate karma. Oh, I missed the minion because I suck
[8871.41s -> 8873.41s]  I'm gonna ward this bush
[8874.53s -> 8876.49s]  Just because I don't want the recon in the bush
[8877.09s -> 8885.70s]  So now that the bush isn't warded anymore
[8886.34s -> 8889.82s]  Okay, he warded it nice. I was gonna say what I want to do is I actually want to play
[8889.82s -> 8895.68s]  Oh, I suck. I actually wanted to play. Oh, man. I'm so bad at Kate
[8895.68s -> 8900.44s]  I wanted to play on the top side of the wave so that I'm not standing near the bushes, right?
[8900.96s -> 8902.96s]  Because if you stand near the bushes
[8903.76s -> 8908.24s]  The Rakan can obviously like W me and I just get fucked so I'd rather play in a safer spot
[8909.48s -> 8911.48s]  Can't believe I missed two CS. I'm so fucking bad
[8912.36s -> 8916.64s]  Now I want to push in wave three and I want to go buy a cull. So I'm gonna ping to push
[8925.36s -> 8927.00s]  Okay
[8927.00s -> 8931.80s]  So I actually want to back here and I'm gonna go buy a coal. So this is called a cheater recall
[8933.28s -> 8937.10s]  You usually have perfect CS to back on this timer
[8937.84s -> 8939.84s]  Go and you can go by a coal. Okay
[8940.32s -> 8944.34s]  This is like something that you can do if you're in a lane that's gonna be perma shoving
[8944.48s -> 8950.60s]  So what happens is the reason it's called the cheater recall is because we push the wave in they had to stay and
[8950.60s -> 8953.00s]  Form the wave right now watch
[8953.00s -> 8961.01s]  They have to push this wave in right now if karma was here instead of roaming this room is fine
[8961.01s -> 8964.05s]  By the way, but if she was here instead of roaming she could actually hold the wave
[8965.21s -> 8976.13s]  And if you notice here, I don't actually miss that many minions, right? We're chilling now. We can slow push this
[8976.25s -> 8978.93s]  We're safe. I should actually fast push this
[8979.81s -> 8983.25s]  Because I wanted to bounce. I don't want to slow push this but I can't I
[8984.17s -> 8987.85s]  Can't fast push this at level three by myself
[8987.85s -> 8997.69s]  so we're just gonna chill. Caitlyn's really good at abusing like early lane phase
[8997.69s -> 9002.77s]  bullying just based on like what our kit does. We see Rakan on the map top side
[9002.77s -> 9009.99s]  you guys see that? So because we see Rakan I can walk up a bit and we
[9009.99s -> 9020.28s]  could play a little aggro here you can kind of see like I don't have to play
[9020.28s -> 9023.96s]  behind the minion wave you see what I'm doing to this guy right? I hate
[9023.96s -> 9033.55s]  this game we can quit we can forfeit it's fine I hate this game I really
[9033.55s -> 9037.63s]  hate this game dude what is wrong with me right now it's like my brain doesn't
[9037.63s -> 9051.12s]  work it's the 280k nerf telling you so Rakan's gonna be bought right now I know
[9051.12s -> 9056.32s]  he's gonna be bought so I need to be a little care now my karma is here
[9056.32s -> 9062.05s]  there we go so you notice I didn't use any spells I'm not I'm just
[9062.05s -> 9072.86s]  chilling dude are you kidding me man I'm gonna be honest I'm getting really
[9072.86s -> 9079.98s]  tilted by these players now. Like the Rakan W's in, they just stand there and watch me die.
[9081.50s -> 9084.94s]  Okay, it's fine. Listen, I'm not gonna get too mad about it. It's fine. I should have flashed
[9084.94s -> 9089.58s]  the knockup, I guess. Even though in reality, I should never have to flash the knockup.
[9089.58s -> 9093.74s]  But I should have flashed it because I can't trust the teammates. So what I'm saying is,
[9093.74s -> 9097.98s]  right there, Karma and Fiddle were both right here. I was being chased down. They stood here.
[9097.98s -> 9101.42s]  They didn't walk up to do anything. They just stood and waited.
[9102.86s -> 9105.42s]  That pisses me off because I hate when players
[9106.62s -> 9108.38s]  play
[9108.38s -> 9110.94s]  Selfish and scared. It's my biggest pet peeve
[9113.87s -> 9115.87s]  It drives me fucking crazy, man
[9116.83s -> 9118.83s]  Sorry, i'm getting i'm losing my mind
[9122.78s -> 9126.44s]  Like it's so easy
[9126.44s -> 9129.72s]  It's fine though. I I shouldn't have walked up and ego'd it. It's on me
[9141.28s -> 9148.81s]  I want to still push this wave
[9148.81s -> 9154.57s]  Yeah, i'm losing it
[9154.57s -> 9158.01s]  This by the way would be an example of a bad time for karma to roam. She needs to come back bot
[9158.01s -> 9165.48s]  There's absolutely no reason for her to roam on that timer.
[9165.48s -> 9167.40s]  There's also no reason for her to be in that bush over there.
[9167.40s -> 9170.64s]  We should be playing up to try, we're playing Kate Karma, right?
[9170.64s -> 9174.08s]  We should be playing forward so that we can actually be aggressive.
[9174.08s -> 9175.40s]  Kate Karma is a lane bully lane.
[9175.40s -> 9177.00s]  We don't want to sit here and just do nothing.
[9177.00s -> 9180.28s]  If you pick Karma, you want to be aggressive, you want to be playing up, you want to
[9180.28s -> 9183.28s]  be stunning, you want to be doing like aggressive things, playing the game.
[9183.28s -> 9187.31s]  We're level six.
[9187.31s -> 9188.63s]  I'd really like to like go in.
[9188.63s -> 9198.71s]  Yeah, like that was actually not bad by the Karma.
[9198.71s -> 9202.39s]  She W'd the Xayah, and then I got to trap off of it, so that wasn't too bad.
[9203.59s -> 9204.59s]  Not the worst.
[9219.68s -> 9220.68s]  Not bad.
[9223.56s -> 9224.56s]  That was good, that was good.
[9225.64s -> 9226.48s]  Really nice, really nice.
[9226.48s -> 9229.36s]  Okay, so I'm gonna back here, because I don't want to overstay for the wave.
[9243.17s -> 9244.17s]  I'm gonna grab boots.
[9248.00s -> 9249.80s]  You know what I think a lot of it is, too?
[9250.64s -> 9253.00s]  I think a lot of it is people get really scared when they...
[9253.00s -> 9254.88s]  Like, Rakan is really strong in this meta, right?
[9254.88s -> 9256.32s]  Like, he's very, very powerful.
[9256.32s -> 9258.52s]  His, like, numbers are a little too high right now,
[9258.52s -> 9260.72s]  so, like, everything he does is just a little too good.
[9260.72s -> 9266.26s]  So I think people get nervous around Rakan, especially with Xayah because it's like when people would get nervous around Nami Lucian
[9266.28s -> 9269.20s]  The lane like plays itself. It's very strong. It's very hard to beat
[9269.60s -> 9273.72s]  But you can still see people making mistakes when they play the lane. So you got to watch for that type of stuff
[9274.16s -> 9283.71s]  now a good way to play against a Xayah once you hit six is
[9287.79s -> 9289.79s]  You don't want to
[9291.07s -> 9296.11s]  You don't want to ever walk melee range of her or give her the ability to just kill you with the feathers
[9296.67s -> 9298.67s]  Your main goal here is gonna be
[9298.87s -> 9300.87s]  Try and stay in a good spot when it comes to
[9302.07s -> 9304.07s]  Feathers like I want to be to the side of her
[9304.35s -> 9308.65s]  The side of her is the best option like where she can't pull in like I'll get hit by maybe a few
[9308.79s -> 9313.39s]  But she can't pull in all of them. That's a really
[9313.99s -> 9317.63s]  Key thing when playing versus her because I remember back in the day
[9317.63s -> 9320.29s]  I didn't know how to play Versailles and I would always get fucking frustrated this shit
[9320.99s -> 9323.89s]  So we're cons five. I want to hit tab see where cons five
[9324.99s -> 9332.45s]  We shouldn't be able to die here. I want to push this wave in but I also need to stay away
[9332.57s -> 9339.56s]  from where the Rakan could be so if you want to push waves in and reset the wave
[9339.56s -> 9343.40s]  make sure that you're standing as far away as you can from where they can
[9343.40s -> 9351.69s]  engage on you now they're about to be six Rakan is so they have a really
[9351.69s -> 9355.17s]  strong level six she has pickaxe and noon quiver we do want to be a little
[9355.17s -> 9360.53s]  hesitant here we don't want to fight now I'm gonna kind of push this in a
[9360.53s -> 9364.57s]  bit we should have been spam pushing the whole wave because that's how Kate
[9364.57s -> 9371.01s]  karma plays we just push push push push but we played that that early roam by
[9371.01s -> 9376.89s]  karma kind of put us behind on that it's not a big deal it's just something
[9376.89s -> 9388.80s]  that we have to adjust why does this say 88 and this say 90 which one is it
[9388.80s -> 9411.33s]  is it 88 or 90 I mean that guy's dead I don't know what that karma's
[9411.33s -> 9422.44s]  But we probably have to give this Drake. I mean, maybe we could fight it if fiddle had ulti but
[9423.16s -> 9432.34s]  Him not having old. Yeah, there's no way the higher one counts ward kills
[9433.38s -> 9435.38s]  Why? I
[9436.10s -> 9439.08s]  Think that's so stupid so they might try and engage here
[9440.82s -> 9442.54s]  Unless they somehow know
[9442.54s -> 9446.08s]  Fiddles in the bush which would be impressive because we know it's not warded
[9446.54s -> 9472.70s]  So that'd be pretty impressive if they knew that we could actually rift. I'm just gonna ghost
[9473.54s -> 9479.12s]  This is crazy what the fuck
[9479.84s -> 9481.52s]  Well, this is interesting
[9481.52s -> 9490.18s]  They saw fed a hundred percent. Yeah, I don't know where though. It must it cuz he used this thing
[9491.70s -> 9496.58s]  Little used his whatever it's called his effigy
[9497.32s -> 9504.32s]  I'd have to go look one million. Oh, I guess I didn't see it. I
[9506.42s -> 9508.42s]  Should back I can get dove here
[9508.62s -> 9512.50s]  We don't know where Greg is says like if Greg is happens to be like he ease over this wall or something
[9512.50s -> 9515.98s]  I think it don't really easy. I'm greeting really hard
[9515.98s -> 9516.98s]  Pardon.
[9516.98s -> 9519.30s]  Greeting usually gets you killed.
[9519.30s -> 9520.30s]  Typically.
[9520.30s -> 9524.46s]  I shouldn't be doing this.
[9524.46s -> 9528.70s]  They're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right?
[9528.70s -> 9535.70s]  It's like if you know something's gonna be a bad habit, you should not do it.
[9535.70s -> 9536.70s]  Just cue the bush.
[9536.70s -> 9543.50s]  Okay, that was, I meant use like an actual cue.
[9543.50s -> 9552.14s]  They could also be in the alcove, so I'm a little hesitant, but it's fine.
[9552.14s -> 9557.38s]  Okay, so the reason I stayed was because now I have my, I have my mythic, right?
[9557.38s -> 9560.98s]  we finished the coal and we finished the mythic at the same time or finished the wave so
[9562.90s -> 9566.66s]  now i have two options i go gale force here uh to dodge a lot of their shits
[9567.54s -> 9575.46s]  or i can do what sounds like a fun option we're gonna do shield bow i'm gonna show you guys why
[9575.46s -> 9582.34s]  i like shield bow on caitlyn it's not the best mythic but it's good into certain comps
[9582.34s -> 9587.94s]  If you don't want to get uh, yeah
[9589.70s -> 9591.86s]  Because I have alacrity this game I don't have bloodline right
[9592.74s -> 9604.37s]  So I kind of want to go shield bow and then i'm gonna end up going, uh, either ie or i'm gonna end up going
[9608.05s -> 9610.05s]  like bloodthirster seconds
[9610.05s -> 9612.05s]  ie or bt
[9612.29s -> 9614.29s]  Probably ie just because uh
[9615.41s -> 9617.73s]  I think I think it's actually easier to go ie this game
[9617.73s -> 9637.96s]  But yeah, this is a kind of boring game. Our team's done really well though. So we just chill we gotta be a little care
[9638.60s -> 9639.68s]  Okay
[9639.68s -> 9657.40s]  It was kind of hard to do anything there
[9657.68s -> 9659.68s]  Even though I got like a few autos on the gragas
[9659.72s -> 9662.14s]  It's a little difficult to actually play the game there
[9662.56s -> 9672.56s]  Because if I walk up too far like see where cons are if I walk up too far, I just get killed by Rakan
[9672.68s -> 9677.05s]  All right. I'm just gonna reset and go get boots
[9679.82s -> 9682.10s]  Typically 80 carry is really fucking boring
[9682.86s -> 9684.86s]  in games like this
[9685.22s -> 9687.22s]  Where?
[9687.22s -> 9700.48s]  You can't really blow the game open. Oh, I'm dead. Maybe wait karma shield me. I'm not dead. Nice
[9721.32s -> 9728.24s]  Motherfucker Kobe'd me man. Here's like goby. We can fight this though. They have no ults
[9734.21s -> 9736.89s]  Like this is actually fightable. They have no Zyra and no
[9737.61s -> 9746.09s]  Braggas are and this is also why it's really important that you relate to your team the cooldowns of your team
[9747.21s -> 9752.67s]  Remember that don't forget that if somebody uses a big cooldown tell your team because that was an illegal dragon
[9752.83s -> 9756.67s]  Right, like they just that was one of the most illegal things i've seen in a while
[9757.79s -> 9759.07s]  homie
[9759.07s -> 9778.10s]  Completely griefed that
[9778.10s -> 9781.94s]  That's another very very very important thing that you need to take away from playing
[9782.34s -> 9784.98s]  League and being like this is what I was saying about the teamwork and shit earlier
[9786.58s -> 9789.86s]  Being good at the game is a lot of spreading knowledge as well, right?
[9790.86s -> 9795.98s]  Like if you if your team doesn't know if a flash is up or down you have to play completely differently, right?
[9796.38s -> 9798.74s]  Like you got to think about the game in that in terms of that as well
[9798.74s -> 9803.18s]  Like how many times have you seen like, you know, you're like, oh I can walk up here if this guy can't flash
[9803.18s -> 9804.54s]  Ult me or something, right?
[9804.54s -> 9820.85s]  It happens all the time. I wonder if I can kill a duskblade Zed. I don't know. I probably could
[9831.10s -> 9832.58s]  I should go mad
[9832.58s -> 9843.30s]  What do you think about Teemo and other top lane as AD carry? I play Teemo AD carry when I'm playing for fun sometimes
[9844.22s -> 9855.09s]  It's okay. Yo, go look on your game, man
[9856.07s -> 9860.11s]  So during the mid game is Caitlyn a few things that I can kind of teach you
[9860.11s -> 9862.03s]  This was kind of a boring lane phase, right?
[9862.03s -> 9867.99s]  Like we didn't really do that much the lane phase was essentially just like we died once and then you know
[9867.99s -> 9869.87s]  Everything all hell broke loose
[9869.87s -> 9871.87s]  When you're walking up the fights like this
[9872.43s -> 9874.95s]  Make sure that you're putting traps down in places
[9875.63s -> 9884.98s]  Where the enemy has to walk just like that?
[9884.98s -> 9889.98s]  Playing Caitlyn is not always about just like autoing and getting Qs and shits.
[9889.98s -> 9893.98s]  If you noticed during that fight, I put two traps here, two traps here.
[9893.98s -> 9902.61s]  I forced the enemy team into like a location where they had to eat traps or they can't find us, right?
[9902.61s -> 9909.88s]  And even if like they avoid the traps, they're still having to like move their character
[9909.88s -> 9913.88s]  in a very unique specific way that they probably don't want to do.
[9913.88s -> 9921.11s]  So you should always be thinking where should I put these traps down at the start of a fight?
[9921.11s -> 9927.27s]  Not like how do I get autos off think about using your traps to zone and that I control the team fight before the fight starts
[9927.27s -> 9929.27s]  rather than using it to
[9929.59s -> 9933.05s]  Do damage because they'll step in the traps themselves
[9933.99s -> 9937.63s]  People will just people are stupid. They're bad. People aren't paying attention
[9938.55s -> 9940.55s]  Everything I'm bad
[9940.59s -> 9944.99s]  You know what? I mean people can't pay attention to every bush that you're putting traps in during a big fight
[9945.11s -> 9962.01s]  It's it's too much attention span. Nobody has it nice
[9962.01s -> 9965.38s]  I'm gonna go grab this red. Oh
[9967.57s -> 9969.97s]  big tip for all the ad carries in chat guys
[9970.77s -> 9972.33s]  I'm gonna tell you right now
[9972.33s -> 9974.33s]  Once the 20-minute mark happens in league
[9975.01s -> 9977.09s]  Your junglers camps are no longer his I
[9978.01s -> 9982.97s]  Know I know junglers are gonna hate me for this. Okay. Listen, if you're a jungle player, you're like fuck this guy
[9982.97s -> 9989.89s]  Now I hate him. Listen, you know, it's true. You know at 20 minutes your camps no longer like they're not yours anymore, man
[9989.97s -> 9993.77s]  Okay, like you you you are full items at this point
[9993.77s -> 9997.57s]  Okay, like I want to be honest you would I'm taking your camps
[9998.01s -> 10014.11s]  I'm trying to get my third item as fast as humanly possible because 80 carries spike on three items extremely hard
[10020.79s -> 10024.47s]  And I want to walk top but we have no vision of this area. So it's a little scary
[10025.03s -> 10030.78s]  Like I said, I typically don't like to take
[10031.52s -> 10033.52s]  jungles camps early game ever
[10034.16s -> 10036.98s]  Because like that's why I say if I get 20 minutes
[10036.98s -> 10041.72s]  Usually you have two items at this point if you're like farming decent and you know, you know, etc
[10041.72s -> 10046.00s]  Sometimes it'll be faster, but usually it's around average of like you'll have your items at this points
[10048.63s -> 10051.65s]  Always be tabbing to the team fights. Even if you're farming as well
[10073.30s -> 10079.30s]  Zed is in this bush
[10079.34s -> 10081.70s]  Wait, where is he? Wait, I'm stupid. Where'd he go? Oh
[10082.66s -> 10084.66s]  He died. I killed him
[10085.38s -> 10094.77s]  Wow, I'm really smart. I like didn't notice that I killed that guy
[10095.91s -> 10102.44s]  I'm so dumb
[10102.44s -> 10111.22s]  80 carry brain right boys. I was like playing that so scared too because I was like I was like is he there?
[10121.02s -> 10123.02s]  Pull the dragon out. Oh
[10123.94s -> 10129.18s]  I asked this yesterday, but what do you guys think the coolest looking dragon is? I swear it's the I
[10130.22s -> 10132.22s]  Think Mountain Drake looks fucking sick
[10168.90s -> 10171.82s]  Welcome to the here. You saw that I like three time to push mad, right?
[10172.34s -> 10176.74s]  Jara height that's mainly because we are karma just got picked off and
[10178.66s -> 10182.00s]  I don't want to give them the option of pushing the wave
[10182.00s -> 10207.54s]  So by pushing the lane nice by pushing the the lane in it takes away an option for the enemy
[10208.18s -> 10210.56s]  That's something that a lot of people think like oh, I just want farm
[10210.56s -> 10214.98s]  I don't care about the farm right like when I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game
[10215.38s -> 10217.26s]  and I'm pushing like a
[10217.26s -> 10220.98s]  mid-wave in before a fight if we're just sieging around the Baron I
[10222.10s -> 10226.60s]  Having that wave pushed in gives them gives us an another option. I'm like what we can do in the game
[10227.30s -> 10229.62s]  And it takes you three seconds to push it in so
[10229.62s -> 10234.62s]  So if the fight's already over and you have time,
[10234.62s -> 10237.86s]  always be paying attention to like trying to push in waves
[10237.86s -> 10241.02s]  so that you can create a little bit of that pressure.
[10241.02s -> 10242.50s]  Yo, hail, thank you so much for the 14, man.
[10242.50s -> 10244.10s]  Welcome back.
[10244.10s -> 10244.94s]  What do I get next?
[10244.94s -> 10246.58s]  I kind of want to get BT.
[10247.50s -> 10251.71s]  I'm gonna get BT.
[10251.71s -> 10253.91s]  I could get Dom's, but I think BT is better
[10253.91s -> 10256.55s]  because I already have Overheal, right?
[10256.55s -> 10259.59s]  So the shield from BT plus Shield Bow plus IE,
[10259.59s -> 10261.27s]  I don't think I'll be able to die.
[10261.27s -> 10263.03s]  Okay, I think I'm unkillable.
[10263.03s -> 10265.31s]  Act, actually, like actually unkillable.
[10266.19s -> 10267.99s]  So here, I'm gonna actually give these camps to Fiddle
[10267.99s -> 10269.45s]  because he's literally pathing to them.
[10269.45s -> 10287.22s]  I don't want to be an asshole, but wow.
[10287.22s -> 10288.54s]  What just happened?
[10288.54s -> 10289.38s]  I'm bad.
[10290.78s -> 10293.18s]  I feel like I got hooked by Kled.
[10294.60s -> 10296.26s]  Oh, he flashed.
[10296.26s -> 10297.10s]  Okay.
[10297.94s -> 10299.90s]  I was like, I feel like what just happened was like,
[10299.90s -> 10302.06s]  I mispositioned because like I went up here, right?
[10302.06s -> 10303.58s]  Like I ghosted and went up here
[10303.58s -> 10307.82s]  there was two people here two people here i put traps down these kind of sloppy traps and then
[10307.82s -> 10313.26s]  i positioned here and then cled flash cued me under the yeah okay that makes sense i'm just bad
[10316.12s -> 10326.67s]  it was okay though because if the entire enemy team has to literally like double flash on you
[10326.67s -> 10330.35s]  to kill you under the turret and then your team follows up it's not that big of a deal
[10330.99s -> 10332.83s]  galeforce would have saved me there though actually
[10332.83s -> 10343.04s]  Okay, Galeforce totally gonna save me because he has serpents
[10345.67s -> 10350.83s]  Serpents definitely shits on chill bow. I'm kind of stupid for going show by this game. I
[10353.07s -> 10357.71s]  Wanted to try it out cuz I when I before when I was playing Caitlin like before the IE rework and everything
[10358.15s -> 10359.75s]  everybody would go
[10359.75s -> 10363.57s]  Or there was like one guy in challenger would go shield bow into shit every game
[10363.75s -> 10366.19s]  And I wanted to see if like it was still viable
[10366.19s -> 10368.75s]  But there might just be better options now like always scale force a
[10369.71s -> 10376.20s]  BT or something. Oh my god. I flashed late. I'm dead
[10379.31s -> 10382.59s]  Dude, I flashed late for some reason. I'm so dumb
[10383.55s -> 10385.55s]  my bad
[10385.79s -> 10387.47s]  I was giving an mb
[10387.47s -> 10389.47s]  Like my brain is moving slowly
[10390.27s -> 10392.27s]  Like I can feel it turning
[10392.99s -> 10394.99s]  I'm just playing bad
[10394.99s -> 10398.35s]  Like I I was baiting the cled to go in on me because karma was there
[10398.35s -> 10401.15s]  But what I need to do is I need to trap on top myself when he goes in
[10401.71s -> 10404.71s]  Then I need to flash net and the clutches dies
[10405.31s -> 10408.88s]  You can also just kill him. I
[10410.12s -> 10412.40s]  Was gonna say they have nothing
[10413.16s -> 10424.90s]  We just play for dragon here. I don't know why I'm playing so bad today. I played bad yesterday, too
[10424.90s -> 10427.44s]  I don't know what's going on. My like brain is broken
[10444.97s -> 10447.09s]  Dude, there were con was trying so hard. Oh
[10482.41s -> 10489.11s]  I've made so many mistakes this game. I fucked up positioning
[10489.31s -> 10509.21s]  mechanics farm all kinds of shit uh i still don't want lord dom's actually i don't think lord dom's
[10509.21s -> 10517.77s]  is good this game like they have no armor like kled has merc treads which i feel like
[10520.01s -> 10533.28s]  really bad into our team but uh oh a little tip that you guys can have for caitlyn too
[10534.16s -> 10540.40s]  when you are like baron's up in in 50 seconds right so a little thing you can do that's
[10540.40s -> 10544.50s]  It's actually kind of fun is you want to be at the objective before the like rule with them
[10544.50s -> 10548.32s]  When an objective is coming up, you always want to be on that side of the map before the before the objective comes up
[10549.16s -> 10550.98s]  but
[10550.98s -> 10552.98s]  You can put down traps
[10553.82s -> 10555.82s]  in the bushes
[10555.82s -> 10559.44s]  Around the objectives and people will face check them and you can just one tap them away game
[10561.22s -> 10569.62s]  It's actually incredibly fun, but you just put them in the corners of the bushes where people have to walk
[10575.74s -> 10578.02s]  Like right here. I can put it right between the turret
[10590.08s -> 10592.48s]  I don't know why I didn't ghost.
[10592.48s -> 10597.33s]  I'll be honest, I have no idea why I didn't ghost.
[10597.33s -> 10598.81s]  I was like saving it for something.
[10598.81s -> 10599.73s]  I'm not sure what.
[10602.65s -> 10604.41s]  Next year, a birthday present.
[10604.41s -> 10605.45s]  Who the fuck knows?
[10609.36s -> 10610.48s]  Oh, I could have one shot that guy
[10610.48s -> 10611.72s]  if I was better at Cait.
[10613.16s -> 10615.12s]  I did a really classic combo right there.
[10615.12s -> 10618.74s]  I just didn't Q because I'm bad.
[10618.74s -> 10619.94s]  I should have, when he hit the trap,
[10619.94s -> 10621.82s]  your two headshots sit on him for a few seconds.
[10621.82s -> 10622.98s]  So what I should have done
[10622.98s -> 10624.58s]  is I should have instantly Q'd on top of the trap
[10624.58s -> 10626.52s]  then auto-auto'd and he would have died.
[10626.52s -> 10628.68s]  Cause your Q does the max damage when they're trapped too.
[10628.68s -> 10632.14s]  So it would have been like a, just a perfect three shot.
[10632.14s -> 10634.44s]  But like I said, I don't play Kade enough
[10634.44s -> 10636.16s]  and my muscle memory is kind of trash sometimes.
[10636.16s -> 10650.00s]  So that was my bad.
[10650.00s -> 10651.40s]  Oh, we're getting cluttered.
[10652.32s -> 10674.97s]  I don't know where he is, but I shouldn't have done that.
[10674.97s -> 10677.43s]  I'm limit testing really hard right now.
[10677.43s -> 10678.99s]  I suggest you guys don't limit test.
[10678.99s -> 10680.75s]  Well, actually I do think you should limit test,
[10680.75s -> 10682.51s]  but not if you want to win, like play safer.
[10682.51s -> 10684.79s]  Like right there, the play wasn't to go back in.
[10684.79s -> 10692.02s]  The point was to like back off, but I wanted to see if I could like I wanted to see if I was terrible or not
[10693.62s -> 10695.14s]  You know
[10695.14s -> 10697.14s]  I was
[10697.54s -> 10700.10s]  But yeah, I mean the combo with kate is like if they're trapped
[10700.66s -> 10703.86s]  you want to queue while they're in the trap essentially because
[10705.22s -> 10708.74s]  Your auto will always give you the range. So if you auto and then queue
[10709.38s -> 10711.38s]  um
[10711.46s -> 10714.34s]  When when they're trapped they get uh, not a lot of people know this
[10714.34s -> 10721.14s]  because I just found this out like a few years or like after I should have.
[10721.14s -> 10726.10s]  When you queue on top of a K-trap, the way K8's queue works is when you queue, the initial
[10726.10s -> 10730.74s]  like it hits initially and then it does less damage to the targets behind it, right?
[10730.74s -> 10732.74s]  It's very narrow and then it like gets bigger.
[10732.74s -> 10738.06s]  So when they're trapped though, it does the maximum queue damage that it can do
[10738.06s -> 10740.06s]  in like the isolation of the queue.
[10740.06s -> 10745.57s]  So that's why when people are trapped, you want to open up with your queue.
[10745.57s -> 10750.77s]  You either want to net into the queue and then double auto or you want to net or you
[10750.77s -> 10756.49s]  want to like you want to queue then trap net at the same time then double auto.
[10756.49s -> 10759.27s]  You basically it's a very interesting way to play it.
[10759.27s -> 10762.15s]  You always want to try and overlay a trap on your trap.
[10762.15s -> 10766.85s]  So when they get trapped, you can overlay a second trap to either in front of them
[10766.85s -> 10767.97s]  or behind them.
[10767.97s -> 10770.95s]  And what will happen is there's actually like a little mini like I want to say
[10770.95s -> 10775.21s]  one second cooldown of being able to be trapped right like a little 1.5 two second
[10775.21s -> 10778.95s]  cool down. But what can happen is they sit in the trap. Then what you can do is your
[10778.95s -> 10784.07s]  neck and slow them. So you can you can actually queue in the first trap, then you can drop
[10784.07s -> 10788.31s]  a second trap net slow them into the second trap and then triple auto headshot them from
[10788.31s -> 10803.31s]  all three of the net the two traps. It's really complicated sounding. But this man
[10803.31s -> 10822.63s]  is redeemed end my stream whenever you want. What? Why? Why would you want to
[10822.63s -> 10851.82s]  my stream right now why would you want to be that guy wow okay don't change don't end just change
[10851.82s -> 10861.85s]  the camera position did you just spend one million points to tell me to put the camera back on the
[10861.85s -> 10880.38s]  right side of my fucking no way no way you just did that i was like this man is just flexing
[10880.38s -> 10885.38s]  He's just like, yeah, I got some points to spare. I guess I could like throw them, you know, eh
[10889.29s -> 10902.39s]  Alright, fine. There's that better
[10903.39s -> 10910.04s]  Is that better?
[10910.04s -> 10917.25s]  Drink water. Actually, that's a good one. I'll be our B. I'm gonna get some water. Should we play on our main?
[10917.87s -> 10919.87s]  I kind of want to try and hit GM
[10919.91s -> 10923.37s]  Yeah, let's get on our main account. It's like 1 p.m. So it's like 3 p.m. Eastern. I
[10924.27s -> 10925.63s]  think I
[10925.63s -> 10927.63s]  Can get queues at the moment
[10927.63s -> 10934.57s]  Let me get some water and then we'll queue up or we'll queue up then get some water real
[10934.57s -> 10943.66s]  quick.
[10943.66s -> 10953.06s]  Because I think it's late enough in the day I can get queues now without waiting 40 minutes.
[10953.06s -> 10957.46s]  By the way, it is a teaching stream when I'm doing that like AD Carry Academy thing.
[10957.46s -> 10960.78s]  So if you guys have any questions you want to ask or like, you guys can ignore that.
[10960.78s -> 10964.54s]  If you guys have any questions you want to ask or anything like that, you know,
[10964.54s -> 10967.34s]  we're just chilling between games, just ask whatever you want.
[10967.34s -> 10971.74s]  I can answer a lot easier between games that I can in game.
[10971.74s -> 10975.74s]  It's a lot easier for me to see that shit. I try and answer in game, but like sometimes I'm like focusing and shit
[10976.14s -> 10988.01s]  So it's a little harder. I am gonna get some water though. So I'll be right back. Okay
[10989.09s -> 10991.09s]  Talk amongst yourselves
[10991.25s -> 10994.73s]  Is Kraken troll on Kate? No, Kraken is good on Kate
[10995.57s -> 10999.49s]  you can go Kraken into bloodthirster or Kraken into IE if you really need it if
[11000.33s -> 11002.67s]  If they have like tanks so they have like Sion
[11002.67s -> 11006.99s]  So 20 and stuff like that you have to like you're the only damage
[11006.99s -> 11011.87s]  Let's say you're like the only tank killer on the team. You're the only 80 damage. You have to go cracking sometimes
[11075.51s -> 11077.51s]  Best day of my life
[14449.64s -> 14453.64s]  .
[14453.64s -> 14457.72s]  .
[14457.72s -> 14461.72s]  .
[14461.72s -> 14465.72s]  .
[14465.72s -> 14469.76s]  .
[14469.76s -> 14473.80s]  .
[14473.80s -> 14477.80s]  .
[14477.80s -> 14480.94s]  often we won because we were the better AD carry, right?
[14480.94s -> 14483.14s]  This game, it doesn't matter.
[14483.14s -> 14487.96s]  Because TF does 11k damage, doesn't ulti bot more than one time.
[14487.96s -> 14495.34s]  Like Rengar did well, Gnar did well, but they also had a horrible macro.
[14495.34s -> 14500.34s]  Like it is insane to me how easy support is as a role and just how dogshit every
[14500.34s -> 14502.80s]  support player is on the server.
[14502.80s -> 14506.18s]  Like your role requires zero thought.
[14506.18s -> 14512.16s]  Your thought when playing support is, do I get vision or not?
[14512.16s -> 14515.78s]  If no, where can I be the most useful?
[14515.78s -> 14522.99s]  Your thought should never be, this game's over, my team sucks.
[14522.99s -> 14524.31s]  It drives me ludicrous.
[14524.31s -> 14531.89s]  Like I'm sorry that I have to play support on this account to climb, but it's crazy
[14531.89s -> 14535.89s]  how dog shit AD carry is when you're solo queuing in Masters.
[14535.89s -> 14540.37s]  Like in GM, like if it's a full GM game, AD carry is easy as fuck.
[14540.37s -> 14544.15s]  If everybody has a brain activity and they're not idiots ad carry is amazing
[14544.41s -> 14550.83s]  Favorite role in the game when you're playing with people who don't know what they're doing and you're actively trying to climb and improve it
[14551.45s -> 14558.25s]  Genuinely feels like I'm pulling out a ball hair with my tweezers or pulling out my ball hairs with tweezers like one by one
[14558.85s -> 14565.01s]  It is so painful. It's crazy
[14565.61s -> 14571.74s]  Like let's take a look at this this support main right now
[14572.58s -> 14574.90s]  97 LP negative win rate, right? I
[14574.90s -> 14582.18s]  I could I could literally tell that he was not a good player in the first 30 seconds of that game
[14582.46s -> 14589.83s]  I'm sorry. I'm being mean but dude this has been driving me crazy
[14590.59s -> 14600.36s]  Like look at the look at the support. I had last game. Also, can I ask a question? Why am I even allowed?
[14601.12s -> 14608.80s]  Why am I even allowed to be in games with a challenger support one game? I win the game
[14609.60s -> 14610.96s]  then
[14610.96s -> 14614.04s]  Immediately it puts me in a game with a 97 LP
[14615.28s -> 14620.54s]  Master support
[14620.54s -> 14622.54s]  What is this matchmaking?
[14622.74s -> 14629.45s]  This is insane
[14629.57s -> 14660.98s]  That's crazy. I I don't even I'm wondering why
[14661.66s -> 14668.15s]  So I'm gonna go on a rant for a second. Why is this allowed?
[14668.83s -> 14674.39s]  Why can you be in a game? Why can I be in a game with a literal guy who's about to promote to challenger?
[14674.39s -> 14680.75s]  right? We win the game, and then the very next game it puts me in a game with a guy
[14680.75s -> 14704.63s]  who's 97 LP. This is insane. Sorry, that's just frustrating as fuck. Because it's like
[14704.63s -> 14719.14s]  such bad game design. Right? Like that's that's 900 LP difference. And the thing is,
[14719.14s -> 14723.98s]  this guy doesn't have good MMR. Right? Like, like, it's not it's not like this
[14723.98s -> 14731.10s]  this guy has good MMR, right? Because look at his games. He's playing with all masters
[14731.10s -> 14737.98s]  players. They're all like 100 LP masters 70 LP 30 LP right? It doesn't make sense. He
[14737.98s -> 14744.50s]  it's not like his MMR is high. So why is this guy getting into like a 600 LP Grand
[14744.50s -> 14749.70s]  Master game? Why are we putting that guy in the game? That's so frustrating. Sorry,
[14749.70s -> 14758.94s]  I just I needed events. How do you know which ad carry to pick in each situation?
[14759.58s -> 14762.38s]  Uh, it's a lot of knowledge a lot of knowledge
[14764.38s -> 14766.38s]  Like you have to know
[14766.86s -> 14768.38s]  A lot of shit
[14768.38s -> 14773.98s]  Like what the enemy champions do what your champions need to do to win the game what the win cons are
[14775.18s -> 14777.02s]  You can just pick
[14777.02s -> 14779.02s]  And i'm being honest though. You could just pick uh
[14781.50s -> 14785.66s]  Like there are ad carries in the current meta where you can just pick their blinds like I was making a tier list
[14785.74s -> 14787.18s]  I forgot about it
[14787.18s -> 14789.78s]  But I mean, you can blind pick Jinx pretty much every game.
[14791.28s -> 14793.18s]  Like Jinx is just blindable every game, pretty much.
[14793.18s -> 14795.18s]  She's insane. She's super OP.
[14796.18s -> 14798.38s]  So if you if you ever just want to play a champion
[14798.38s -> 14800.68s]  and you think like, OK, I want to practice AD, like Jinx is insane.
[14801.08s -> 14802.08s]  Super good.
[14805.53s -> 14807.43s]  Draven's not blindable,
[14807.43s -> 14809.83s]  but I do think he's really good if you're good at the game.
[14810.23s -> 14811.43s]  Draven's very good.
[14812.23s -> 14815.53s]  He's he's he's harder than Jinx by a mile, like Draven's a lot harder,
[14815.53s -> 14819.53s]  But he's definitely like good at carrying with a lead as well
[14820.09s -> 14824.50s]  Like another blindable AD that I think is like A tier is like Varus
[14825.04s -> 14829.32s]  You can blind pick Varus really easily because Varus doesn't really have counters
[14830.34s -> 14835.66s]  Like he doesn't get countered by anything. He's more of like a you can pick him and then
[14836.18s -> 14841.28s]  Go even and your ulti will always be useful. You can look to like win lane. You can look to like
[14841.90s -> 14867.55s]  engage things like that, right
[14868.15s -> 14870.15s]  Okay, so this game I
[14870.55s -> 14877.41s]  As the support, I need to be tracking the jungler, so I'm going to think where, always
[14877.41s -> 14880.97s]  be thinking what the enemy jungler wants to accomplish and how to stop it.
[14880.97s -> 14885.41s]  That's like a pretty big tip of advice that I can give you guys.
[14885.41s -> 14888.05s]  Like think to yourself like, okay, if I was the enemy jungler, what would I be wanting
[14888.05s -> 14891.57s]  to do against the scrams, right, as Lee Sin?
[14891.57s -> 14894.55s]  He's probably going to want to either gank early, like gank bot early, or he wants
[14894.55s -> 14901.71s]  to invade on certain timers, right, because that's like what Lee is really good at.
[14901.71s -> 14908.61s]  ganking and invading so what I think I'm gonna try to do this game is I'm
[14908.61s -> 14913.69s]  gonna try and watch for early ganks and early pressure bot lane like a level 2
[14913.69s -> 14918.77s]  level 3 ganks we're still gonna be aggressive but Lux took TP which means
[14918.77s -> 14923.33s]  this Lux does not plan on playing aggressive at all like she basically if
[14923.33s -> 14927.85s]  anybody takes TP like this in a lane I already know from start of the game
[14927.85s -> 14930.93s]  that they're not planning on doing anything so I'm probably gonna end up
[14930.93s -> 14950.00s]  roaming a lot this game. This is gonna be a game where I roam a ton. We do have some good lanes to
[14950.00s -> 14966.22s]  roam to too, like roaming top and mid is both really good. I just want her to ward early,
[14968.40s -> 14974.88s]  because I don't want to get shit on by Lee. So okay, I'm just gonna flash immediately.
[14976.24s -> 14980.24s]  There's no reason to not flash there, because Alistar used this flash to get my flash,
[14980.80s -> 14986.00s]  which is totally fine. It's better for him because he has hex flash, but it's not that
[14986.00s -> 14993.66s]  Because I can outrange him and I can stay away from his
[14994.38s -> 14999.16s]  His shit, so we know he's in the bush. We just chill
[15000.10s -> 15002.70s]  There it is. He fucked up now we go forward. I
[15004.18s -> 15008.20s]  Don't know why Lux isn't throwing spells at this guy like I don't know why she didn't Q him
[15009.30s -> 15011.60s]  Like he fucked up the Alistar should have died there
[15013.02s -> 15018.22s]  And she's pinging me. Okay, the Alistar should have died there if Alistar ever fucks up and engage like that where he
[15018.22s -> 15023.00s]  Hex flashes in, gets stuck, like, Q is cooldown, yeah, I don't know why it was thrown is what I'm saying.
[15023.30s -> 15027.38s]  You don't throw, you don't throw spells that, uh, that aren't gonna land.
[15027.94s -> 15033.22s]  So there's no point in Lux ever throwing her Q until Alistar fucks up the combo.
[15033.90s -> 15038.62s]  Like, she should just poke with E, and then, um, because it's almost like a Blitzhook, right?
[15038.62s -> 15043.66s]  Think of it like a Blitzhook. If she throws the, uh, the Q out, right, now
[15043.66s -> 15047.80s]  they have an opportunity to be aggressive because they know the hook, they know the hook is down.
[15048.64s -> 15052.08s]  So it's better for her to just hold the hook essentially, right?
[15053.44s -> 15058.90s]  Hold the queue and now when Alistar does go in they have to be nervous about that queue
[15059.40s -> 15064.16s]  Because they can't just think oh the queues down. Let's let's engage right so they can't actually think about that
[15064.88s -> 15066.88s]  this is why I don't like a
[15071.43s -> 15073.93s]  Lot of the time doing this like push push the wave
[15074.43s -> 15081.09s]  They can't engage on us without like flashing so it doesn't matter like look
[15081.49s -> 15092.57s]  Did she cue the wave again or am I an idiot like just oh man, I'm losing my mind here
[15092.57s -> 15097.07s]  Oh these I'm tilting. It's fine. I need to not tilt
[15097.07s -> 15103.91s]  I need to just chill but I'm getting frustrated because we're like not using cooldowns properly and it's driving me fucking crazy
[15107.54s -> 15111.32s]  Because these are very simple things to do. You guys got to walk the way then by the way
[15111.32s -> 15114.38s]  You can't let them freeze. Okay, they're very simple things to do
[15114.38s -> 15116.26s]  I know I'm being annoying as shit whining about this
[15116.26s -> 15121.62s]  But this is stuff that you you need to be thinking about when you're playing the game. Well, you should actively be thinking
[15123.92s -> 15131.74s]  What can I do with my champions toolkit to stop their champions toolkit and you should be thinking okay, I have Q right
[15132.30s -> 15138.12s]  So what do they want to do? They want to go in okay, and when you're thinking they want to go in
[15140.98s -> 15146.64s]  Right, you should be thinking. Okay when they go in I can just Q and that should be your entire thought process
[15147.52s -> 15149.52s]  Your thought process should never be oh
[15150.84s -> 15158.58s]  Maybe I can land a random cue at max range and we can get a kill she queued the wave. Yes, that's what I mean
[15158.58s -> 15163.56s]  Like you should never cue the wave on Lux either unless you're going to a hundred percent reset
[15165.50s -> 15171.50s]  That would be like if I hooked the wave as like blitzcrank or some shits. Why is my Lux bait pinging my graves?
[15172.18s -> 15175.70s]  Dude, I got to keep this a hundred percent honest with you, man
[15177.46s -> 15179.26s]  You don't get
[15179.26s -> 15181.26s]  You you don't get to be mad here
[15181.86s -> 15184.02s]  Why are these players are such babies?
[15187.68s -> 15196.09s]  Jesus Christ what pussies man these people are such babies the graves played correctly by the way like a hundred percent
[15197.43s -> 15199.51s]  He's mad at the graves for taking a wave
[15199.75s -> 15202.89s]  He wanted to not like he wanted to be able to TP back and get the wave
[15203.21s -> 15210.83s]  That's what this Lux is so trash that she actually believes that the graves faults that graves misplayed by pushing the bot
[15210.83s -> 15211.55s]  wave
[15211.55s -> 15213.55s]  But it was the right play
[15214.19s -> 15217.89s]  Pushing the bot wave was the correct play there because then she doesn't have to TP
[15218.05s -> 15220.65s]  The whole reason that he's pushing it is to save her teleport
[15221.09s -> 15223.09s]  So that she doesn't have to TP to lane
[15227.40s -> 15232.40s]  Players like this are why the game is hard to play right now in the current meta why it feels bad
[15233.12s -> 15238.16s]  Because this Lux is trash everybody you guys can all see this Lux is terrible. She's already made a bunch of mistakes
[15238.16s -> 15240.74s]  She's blaming her team. She's being a dipshit, right?
[15241.44s -> 15243.44s]  but
[15243.84s -> 15246.28s]  She can climb up to this elo being this bad
[15246.28s -> 15275.25s]  Because of the system the current system in place. We should immediately do Baron hair dragon. I mean we should do this come
[15276.29s -> 15278.29s]  You don't have time for this just come do dragon
[15279.65s -> 15288.63s]  Bro the Lee Sin just showed top we should be doing dragon when um
[15297.10s -> 15299.50s]  when this shit happens, by the way where you have
[15300.86s -> 15307.14s]  Enemy jungler shows on one side of the map. You should always be playing on the other side of the map to make a counter play
[15308.02s -> 15312.82s]  So jungler shows on topside we go for dragon, right? Easy
[15313.42s -> 15321.06s]  Yo, be careful Alistar is going to be there. Zerath's going to be there. Just leave
[15321.70s -> 15327.25s]  Just leave leave of leaf. I'll do it for you. I'll make you leave. I got you man
[15329.68s -> 15336.68s]  but we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and I need the back now, but we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and
[15337.68s -> 15339.68s]  not only do their bot lane have to back but
[15339.68s -> 15348.44s]  But the enemy was top.
[15348.44s -> 15349.44s]  I tried, man.
[15349.44s -> 15354.76s]  I tried to flash Q him.
[15354.76s -> 15358.42s]  But yeah, it's really, I don't know, a lot of junglers don't, I don't think they know
[15358.42s -> 15360.52s]  what they're, oh, I'm dead by the way.
[15360.52s -> 15364.16s]  I'm not even gonna pop exhaust, I'm just dead.
[15364.16s -> 15368.44s]  A lot of junglers don't know what the goal of the game actually is.
[15368.44s -> 15371.72s]  A lot of them think it's, I think that was a bad insect, but a lot of junglers
[15371.72s -> 15374.76s]  think the goal of the game is to like get as much farm as you can and run over
[15374.76s -> 15376.26s]  the enemy team and shit.
[15376.26s -> 15382.38s]  But it's also about getting early objectives and turning those small leads into big leads
[15382.38s -> 15386.82s]  through objective control.
[15386.82s -> 15389.22s]  So right now, I want to rotate top.
[15389.22s -> 15390.22s]  Rift is up.
[15390.22s -> 15392.44s]  I know Lee Sin is going to be on top side of the map right now.
[15392.44s -> 15396.98s]  I want to rotate top so that I can help my team by being in the top side of the
[15396.98s -> 15399.58s]  map because that's where the next play is going to be made.
[15399.58s -> 15413.20s]  Well, the play is made mid, but I'm here so it's fine.
[15413.20s -> 15418.66s]  Oh my god.
[15418.66s -> 15422.58s]  I did not think the fucking Lee Sin would be there, too.
[15424.42s -> 15429.30s]  Oh, oops.
[15429.30s -> 15432.98s]  This is rough. I don't really know how to how to play this
[15432.98s -> 15436.46s]  because I got there in time to counter the gank, right?
[15437.22s -> 15439.10s]  I exhausted the guy, saved the Zerath.
[15439.86s -> 15445.44s]  I got there in time to counter the gank, but, oh, well played.
[15447.08s -> 15449.36s]  That's actually mega well played.
[15451.24s -> 15454.61s]  That was really good.
[15454.61s -> 15456.61s]  I want to push this wave in but I can't
[15465.34s -> 15470.86s]  Like uh, you guys are noticing there's no objectives taken on the map yet at 10 minutes, which is kind of crazy
[15471.74s -> 15475.42s]  The alley's doing really good. The alice is not a bad support player. He's playing well
[15484.61s -> 15493.94s]  like he's playing very well
[15493.94s -> 15498.02s]  a lot of this is more of like I need I don't have anything to do on the map because uh,
[15498.90s -> 15501.62s]  I'm trying to help my jungler, but my jungler is trolling
[15502.90s -> 15504.90s]  It's really rough
[15505.06s -> 15508.50s]  Because like i'm trying to rotate over and help my jungler on cooldown basically, right?
[15508.90s -> 15514.14s]  But my jungler doesn't want to fight you see like I'm countering the Alistar's fight. They're ganks. It's just
[15514.74s -> 15524.30s]  I'm just dead
[15524.30s -> 15526.30s]  dude
[15527.02s -> 15533.34s]  Like we shouldn't have made that play mid because we knew that they were all there and we knew that our jungler is doing this
[15534.74s -> 15537.02s]  This might just be a jungle diff honestly
[15538.70s -> 15542.76s]  Like our ad carry sucks, but it might just be a straight-up jungle diff game they do happen
[15542.76s -> 15553.50s]  Especially in this elo where jungle has so much control of the game, they do happen.
[15553.50s -> 15554.90s]  It's a pretty big jungle diff, Chipopi.
[15554.90s -> 15555.90s]  You know it.
[15555.90s -> 15556.90s]  I know it.
[15556.90s -> 15562.82s]  Like, yeah, he's saying yeah, like he knows the jungle is getting outclassed insanely
[15562.82s -> 15566.09s]  hard.
[15566.09s -> 15567.69s]  Because Graves counters Lee Sin.
[15567.69s -> 15571.83s]  It's a massive counter.
[15571.83s -> 15575.79s]  But this guy doesn't know what he's doing.
[15575.79s -> 15578.91s]  I think he's a Rengar one trick and Rengar got banned.
[15578.91s -> 15581.55s]  I think that's what's going on.
[15581.55s -> 15587.93s]  Rengar one trick who got banned out and he tried to play a champion that requires thought not just a I jump you die champ
[15589.11s -> 15599.30s]  Right, and he just gets shit on for it. I mean dude, I can't even I can't even do anything this game
[15600.66s -> 15610.37s]  Our top lenders getting his ass whipped too. It's really fucking rough. I mean he's in here. I'm pretty sure
[15610.89s -> 15613.21s]  It's not it was just it was warded though. I
[15614.33s -> 15616.97s]  Mean we can't really do anything here. I'm dead. I think
[15617.97s -> 15619.97s]  Yeah, I'm just dead
[15620.25s -> 15624.37s]  This is just rough. I I kind of want to go next because I don't think I
[15625.13s -> 15627.41s]  Don't think we have the skill on the team to win
[15629.17s -> 15634.29s]  The jungle diff is huge the 80 diff is huge and I'm just I can't I can't impact the map
[15647.96s -> 15651.58s]  Like I can't I just can't do anything this game to impact the map and it feels really bad. Oh
[15662.69s -> 15664.69s]  Some of it I should have flashed I
[15667.68s -> 15671.20s]  Got like creep blocked a little bit when he knocked me and I like had to walk through I should just flashed up
[15671.20s -> 15675.40s]  That's my man. Like what was that TP man? Oh God get me out
[15676.06s -> 15679.48s]  I'm gonna be a hundred percent real get me out that TP was miserably bad
[15680.20s -> 15682.20s]  dude just TP'd to the wave
[15683.08s -> 15692.82s]  like what is our Lux doing too like I
[15693.86s -> 15695.90s]  Just feel like everybody's late to the fights
[15697.58s -> 15699.58s]  Lux is always late to the fights
[15700.02s -> 15703.92s]  The Graves doesn't want to take fights even though he's playing Graves and Elise in
[15704.62s -> 15707.60s]  Like I I feel like ooh, this is rough. This is a rough game
[15708.50s -> 15710.62s]  Games like this tilt me and I kind of just want to go next
[15710.62s -> 15715.80s]  Because games like this they are winnable, but I feel like I want to go next to save mental, you know
[15716.66s -> 15718.86s]  Like low-key. I just want to save my mental
[15728.82s -> 15730.82s]  Cuz oh, it's so gross
[15732.36s -> 15736.88s]  Like watching what Lux did in the early stages of the lane phase just wasting her Q on repeat
[15737.00s -> 15741.98s]  That was one of the most embarrassing things ever and then like look at that. She just queued a minion. Oh
[15756.55s -> 15765.11s]  Bro, like oh my god, you gotta push the wave man. Holy shits
[15765.71s -> 15777.26s]  I mean, I can't even walk. Oh my god. I
[15779.02s -> 15781.18s]  Don't even have help from my fucking team
[15782.74s -> 15784.74s]  That's the worst part about this
[15788.42s -> 15791.64s]  Dude these games feel so unplayable man
[15793.54s -> 15797.18s]  Like I don't know how else to say it except for they just feel miserable to play
[15797.18s -> 15806.04s]  Like I'm trying to focus on playing like improving myself, but it's so hard to know how to improve in games where like
[15807.94s -> 15809.94s]  You genuinely just
[15810.06s -> 15811.82s]  Get no help
[15811.82s -> 15824.11s]  My locks has been tilted since like minute two for some reason and my graves has been completely pathing wrong doing wrong shit
[15824.67s -> 15827.07s]  It's hard to know how to help like I went mid to help
[15827.51s -> 15829.51s]  countered two of the early ganks
[15829.51s -> 15836.44s]  Lux still griefed the game, so like yeah, it's just it's hard to know and then top lane lost
[15837.24s -> 15841.64s]  It's so rough, man
[15841.92s -> 15851.67s]  Like I'm gonna keep it a hundred percent honest with you. If you are a one trick do not try and play other champs
[15853.11s -> 15854.79s]  You you will int
[15854.79s -> 15864.54s]  You will play badly always and you will int and you will you will complete like look at this. This is
[15865.50s -> 15867.50s]  2.9 K damage as a
[15867.50s -> 15873.88s]  Dude, like what are we doing?
[15873.88s -> 15876.74s]  How are these people getting into this elo?
[15876.74s -> 15880.56s]  How does this lux like end the game?
[15880.56s -> 15888.48s]  She was against an Alistar bot and she did 1 point 2.9k damage in a 16 minute game
[15888.48s -> 15892.28s]  against a melee heavy team.
[15892.28s -> 15893.28s]  Like what is this?
[15893.28s -> 15895.36s]  What is happening?
[15895.36s -> 15903.79s]  This guy was D4 30 LP last season and now he's magically in Masters?
[15903.79s -> 15909.85s]  No, we need to fix matchmaking
[15910.15s -> 15912.15s]  This is this is insane
[15912.17s -> 15919.36s]  Like this is just a matchmaking diff. It's nothing else
[15920.40s -> 15922.32s]  my man literally
[15922.32s -> 15928.88s]  Does not belong in master tier 400 LP MMR at all. Well, you can see that he's not at this level
[15929.40s -> 15946.30s]  Dude, I have the Lux player on my team again. Oh
[15949.71s -> 15962.83s]  This is a Zareth one trick and a Rengar one trick on the enemy team. I don't know man. I
[15962.83s -> 15970.48s]  I guess I care more about the Rengar than the Xerath, but this is rough.
[15970.48s -> 15984.23s]  Oh, what's up, Chipoppy?
[15984.23s -> 15986.23s]  Dude, sorry I hit yes on that, man.
[15986.23s -> 15988.23s]  I know the game was winnable. I'm going to be real.
[15988.23s -> 15992.23s]  But, dude, you didn't see what I saw during the early game of that game, Chipoppy.
[15992.23s -> 15999.18s]  Like, man, the entire early game of that game was like,
[15999.18s -> 16006.18s]  we lost lane because Lux wouldn't use her Q to fight the Alistar.
[16006.18s -> 16008.18s]  She was using it to farm minions.
[16008.98s -> 16012.74s]  Like she was so scared of being engaged on by the Alistar and the Kalista
[16013.22s -> 16016.66s]  That she would use her Q to max range farm minions
[16017.66s -> 16020.86s]  Instead of save it. So when the Alistar engages we just kill him
[16022.38s -> 16025.78s]  Right because if Alistar ever engages on me and Lux he just gets killed
[16026.14s -> 16029.34s]  We just bind him walk away and he's stuck there and he dies, right?
[16029.86s -> 16035.22s]  But for some reason she didn't understand how to do that
[16035.22s -> 16039.38s]  So she was just throwing it to farm so we would just get engaged on so I started roaming and
[16039.38s -> 16045.42s]  Every time I was like roaming to an objective or something the graves would always walk away and not fight
[16045.70s -> 16049.62s]  Like he wasn't attempting to fight. He was basically just like oh, I'm gonna go farm some more
[16049.66s -> 16051.34s]  But I'm like dude, you can't do that
[16051.34s -> 16056.46s]  Like if the Alistar is ganking mid and I'm countering mid you can't just farm farm before coming mid or you can't just like
[16056.46s -> 16061.70s]  Not take dragon and shuttling that right like it blows my mind that these players can get like it's like this guy too
[16062.02s -> 16064.20s]  Same thing like that jungler last game, right?
[16064.20s -> 16069.24s]  Look at this, it's the same thing as the last game, like NA is riddled with this shit,
[16069.24s -> 16070.92s]  it's so miserable to play.
[16070.92s -> 16072.80s]  Look at this, this jungler last game, right?
[16072.80s -> 16074.80s]  He's not, he's what, like a D1 player, right?
[16074.80s -> 16076.64s]  He's not a bad player, he peaked D1.
[16076.64s -> 16078.60s]  But why is this guy in this game now?
[16078.60s -> 16083.16s]  He like artificially inflated to this elo, getting lucky with his first few games,
[16083.16s -> 16084.56s]  and now we have to play with this guy.
[16084.56s -> 16089.15s]  Oh, it's an account share.
[16089.15s -> 16092.75s]  The person, it's a different player, look.
[16092.75s -> 16095.03s]  On the account.
[16095.03s -> 16098.52s]  D flash, F flash.
[16098.52s -> 16103.21s]  So, it's a fucking account share.
[16103.21s -> 16112.18s]  That's frustrating.
[16112.18s -> 16113.62s]  Sorry for whining so much, guys.
[16113.62s -> 16115.82s]  This shit's just really frustrating to me.
[16116.78s -> 16118.22s]  Like, I know I should play it to, like,
[16118.22s -> 16120.70s]  specifically only care about, like, improving,
[16120.70s -> 16121.84s]  and then while you're improving,
[16121.84s -> 16123.74s]  you'll climb automatically and shit,
[16123.74s -> 16125.78s]  but it's really frustrating when, like,
[16127.42s -> 16129.82s]  the players in the game would rather be idiots
[16129.82s -> 16131.94s]  and assholes to each other than play the game.
[16131.94s -> 16134.22s]  Right, like, the game before, the Amumu, right?
[16134.22s -> 16137.32s]  the game before this the amumu was just being toxic the whole game and into the
[16137.32s -> 16140.96s]  win away the last game the Lux and the graves were being toxic to each other
[16140.96s -> 16147.44s]  the whole game we entered the game away it's like I it's it's not fun to lose
[16147.44s -> 16151.44s]  because one player gets mad at another player over them both being idiots
[16151.44s -> 16160.61s]  I'm sorry it's not fun it's so unfun but we'll try and we'll try and
[16160.61s -> 16177.34s]  win this one all we can really do is try and carry the games right it's
[16177.34s -> 16194.68s]  about it what is what what man what what do you think they're gonna do to me
[16194.68s -> 16198.56s]  welcome to the league of the only thing over the seven months man welcome back
[16198.56s -> 16201.92s]  be passed like I really don't want to meet all I don't I don't want to meet
[16201.92s -> 16217.11s]  all because like I I want to like value the pings and shit but dude if
[16217.11s -> 16220.99s]  they walk up I'm gonna flank them that's why I'm standing here
[16220.99s -> 16256.98s]  well that's a big cue I need to get level two first here hundred
[16256.98s -> 16281.59s]  since. Ashe should have just been autoing there that whole time. Because we have heal, so she
[16281.59s -> 16286.39s]  should have just walked up and autoed. As soon as, this is what I mean by tracking cooldowns,
[16286.39s -> 16293.51s]  as soon as the Niko missed her cooldown, as soon as she missed her E, the Ashe should have just
[16293.51s -> 16298.71s]  walked up and immediately started fighting. Because they can no longer kill us.
[16298.71s -> 16303.95s]  The Niko doesn't actually have spells outside of her E
[16304.63s -> 16309.43s]  Right, so if she misses that snare and she used her W too, right? So it's like we just go ham
[16309.87s -> 16317.27s]  You don't need to be too scared. It happens quite a bit sometimes where people will just be like really nervous
[16335.06s -> 16338.68s]  Damn, if I had dodged that Q I actually would have killed all three
[16339.32s -> 16344.54s]  Damn, I don't know if it was worth the flash after the guy. I think it was if I had dodged the Q
[16344.54s -> 16346.18s]  I would have been fine
[16346.18s -> 16352.02s]  So that was that it's whatever I also doesn't miss any creeps here. So it's not the end of the world
[16352.58s -> 16359.43s]  Like I'm pretty sure Lee sin did not have his top camps, by the way
[16366.59s -> 16369.31s]  Damn, if I was a little better mechanically I turned that by the way
[16370.83s -> 16373.82s]  100%
[16373.82s -> 16400.32s]  We should push this wave so that I can go get vision because yeah that guy can't freeze that wave. So
[16400.84s -> 16416.19s]  Sounds too bad
[16416.19s -> 16426.69s]  Lisa's top you can kind of see some really good
[16427.69s -> 16432.79s]  What is this?
[16432.79s -> 16434.79s]  Why is my Karthus afk at turret?
[16435.19s -> 16453.64s]  What is happening right now?
[16453.64s -> 16470.32s]  Why was he afk? I mean, I guess it worked out. But yeah, maybe he had to go let his cat out. I don't know
[16472.64s -> 16481.80s]  Happens we do their bot lane is not very good
[16483.00s -> 16492.46s]  They're trying too hard to force fights that they can't win. Like they they genuinely can't win half these fights that they're trying to force
[16492.46s -> 16496.98s]  Maybe if they were against people who like don't push their buttons they could win those
[16496.98s -> 16499.66s]  But it's like all I have to do is stand there and fight back and they lose
[16500.54s -> 16504.42s]  They're on dragon a thousand percent right now. There's not a lot I can do about that
[16505.86s -> 16508.74s]  We just have to chill there's almost nothing I can do about it
[16509.30s -> 16512.46s]  Kaisa is trying to fake act like she's big but it's just
[16515.77s -> 16517.77s]  There's just nothing we can do
[16519.26s -> 16529.21s]  Cuz our car this is top. So we just chill they finished the cheerless. No, no, not yet
[16530.05s -> 16535.25s]  Oh, Lee sin could be bought right now
[16537.49s -> 16541.89s]  Mmm, I don't think it's too bad if he's bought though. They can't really dive us especially with card assaults
[16542.53s -> 16559.12s]  Why why does my ash just run?
[16560.16s -> 16567.74s]  She like just straight-up runs away. It's kind of silly
[16576.82s -> 16581.62s]  Because we have we have card this ulti like we can win at five. All right, we can win a fight bot right now
[16581.62s -> 16588.78s]  I guess I guess I'm just gonna have to get them low enough for car this to kill them
[16588.78s -> 16592.54s]  Like without the uh, ash's help
[16593.82s -> 16595.82s]  Which I think I can do that's not too bad
[16597.61s -> 16599.61s]  Okay, the akali's coming bot
[16600.65s -> 16602.65s]  We just killed him. I mean, let's just fight
[16610.84s -> 16612.84s]  I don't know why we should just ash arrow. Honestly
[16615.04s -> 16621.63s]  Just ash arrow
[16621.63s -> 16623.63s]  Okay, that was pretty bad ash arrow, but
[16630.76s -> 16633.64s]  Filled, uh, I don't think he's filled. I think he's just having a bad game
[16635.24s -> 16637.24s]  Like I think it happens, you know
[16637.80s -> 16642.72s]  Whoa, okay
[16642.72s -> 16644.72s]  Do it ult me. I fucking dare you
[16649.34s -> 16651.34s]  i'm trying to keep some mana
[16651.74s -> 16666.64s]  So that I can ulti
[16666.80s -> 16668.88s]  Oh carthus already used his ults fuck
[16675.44s -> 16677.44s]  They both backed there. Wow
[16681.84s -> 16684.24s]  My bad. I honestly didn't think they were both gonna back there
[16686.86s -> 16689.66s]  Like I thought the kaisa was gonna back right where I saw her like last
[16690.78s -> 16692.54s]  That was my bad
[16692.54s -> 16694.54s]  Um, I should be
[16694.94s -> 16696.94s]  I think we sin can come bot here and kill me
[16699.96s -> 16701.96s]  I should actually stop this guy's back
[16706.57s -> 16712.41s]  Yeah, I should stop his back because it's more value to stop the back now even if Lee sin isn't but it's more value
[16713.57s -> 16715.57s]  Because he's so low
[16716.45s -> 16718.97s]  Collie is Mia though. So we got to be care. I
[16720.81s -> 16723.37s]  Wasted my ult though, which makes me kind of scared
[16723.81s -> 16726.93s]  The other thing that kind of sucks about this is we don't have good vision
[16727.45s -> 16737.23s]  And I can't really help anybody on the map because the same thing is happening as before
[16738.55s -> 16741.59s]  We're like we're missing opportunities to get kills on timers
[16745.12s -> 16749.60s]  I mean the dog lightning guy is playing fine this game. I think he's trolled a lot like he's he's trolling
[16749.68s -> 16751.68s]  This isn't like his best game
[16752.48s -> 16756.40s]  But it's also I I don't know why we're getting so tilted around the map right now
[16757.20s -> 16760.00s]  because if i'm if i'm being honest, we should just win the game off of like
[16761.76s -> 16773.00s]  Being better players
[16773.00s -> 16774.84s]  I don't know what this carthus is thinking but
[16780.43s -> 16782.43s]  Do it do it
[16782.43s -> 16788.60s]  Carthus we can fight we can fight just fight bro. What are we doing?
[16788.60s -> 16798.68s]  I'm losing it man. Ah, no, no, no. I'm tilted. I'm tilted as fuck. He didn't walk in just go onto the Akali shroud, man
[16800.12s -> 16804.16s]  Well, I just walk a foot to your right and stand on the Akali shroud
[16804.62s -> 16808.68s]  She just eats your damage like while she's in the shroud. She can't stop that
[16812.67s -> 16814.67s]  Holy shit. I'm losing my minds
[16816.64s -> 16820.78s]  Like Ash is just inting bot waves right now not trying to do anything
[16820.78s -> 16828.02s]  thing locks is really far up on CS which is really good but I'm losing it man
[16828.02s -> 16833.08s]  like we see exactly where they are every game like we see where everybody is on
[16833.08s -> 16836.58s]  the enemy team permanently and we still can't manage to like walk to the right
[16836.58s -> 16845.48s]  location this is driving me crazy my my Carthus 80 my Carthus jungles
[16845.48s -> 16849.18s]  getting out farmed like a Carthus jungles getting out farmed by Elise in
[16849.18s -> 16853.96s]  jungle that's insane like I don't think I don't think I can stress enough how
[16853.96s -> 16860.72s]  crazy that is well you should never be a world where Carthus ever gets out farms
[16860.72s -> 16872.13s]  no way I'm dead dude no way I just fucking ate the end of that now I'm
[16872.13s -> 16888.00s]  playing that just kill the Lee Sin man I fucked up there that was my fault
[16888.00s -> 16892.00s]  cuz I got hit by the tip of the that was my fault I got barely clipped
[16892.00s -> 16896.72s]  by the tip of the neko ults when i was trying to space because i'm bad and if i was alive there
[16896.72s -> 16903.69s]  and i could have saved my flash for the lee sin q we just win i am confused at why we decided to
[16903.69s -> 16908.89s]  like not fight that immediately though like we caught out two of their members and we just got
[16908.89s -> 16913.77s]  scared for whatever reason wait we win this fight we thousand percent win this fight this
[16913.77s -> 16932.62s]  fight this fight this bro do not throw a fucking temper tantrum right now there's one
[16932.62s -> 16942.35s]  kill do not throw a temper tantrum oh my god here we go i took one kill the guy's about to lose his
[16942.35s -> 16957.88s]  mind guys i need to mute all i'm gonna mute all in a second like i i can't with these people right
[16957.88s -> 16968.48s]  now like i can't man you people are disgusting like you guys just whine you play bad you whine
[16968.48s -> 16972.48s]  and you bitch about every little mistake that everything happens even though it's like in the
[16972.48s -> 16976.08s]  the middle of a fight I guarantee I'm a better player than you are and you're
[16976.08s -> 16980.16s]  still whining and crying over one shutdown that like you didn't even walk
[16980.16s -> 16985.00s]  to until I spam pinged you like I literally 1v2 them you hit 1e and now
[16985.00s -> 16996.25s]  you're mad dude I swear League players are fucking psychopaths at least I got
[16996.25s -> 17003.85s]  the exhaust off surely she dies right surely she dies here or not okay okay
[17003.85s -> 17004.85s]  At least she died.
[17006.35s -> 17007.35s]  Help each other, guys.
[17008.95s -> 17009.95s]  Help each other, teamwork.
[17012.74s -> 17014.64s]  Teamwork, teamwork, teamwork, teamwork.
[17019.83s -> 17021.03s]  Wait, this Ashe is insane.
[17026.07s -> 17026.77s]  Okay, I'm not gonna lie.
[17026.77s -> 17028.87s]  That Ashe played that so good.
[17029.27s -> 17031.27s]  I only saw the end of it and she still played that good.
[17032.87s -> 17033.57s]  That was sick.
[17035.37s -> 17036.17s]  Well done.
[17036.47s -> 17037.57s]  That was actually really good.
[17040.26s -> 17041.46s]  She almost stopped the dive.
[17042.56s -> 17043.26s]  That's crazy.
[17043.50s -> 17052.46s]  This game is definitely 1000% still winnable though. We just have to play
[17053.38s -> 17059.46s]  For late game and not lose our fucking minds. I'll let that push back into my ash. I'll go mid and get some vision
[17062.26s -> 17064.26s]  That's pretty much all we have to do
[17064.70s -> 17075.48s]  Play for late and not lose our mind early. We could play to kill this Akali right now. She doesn't know there's no ward here
[17076.82s -> 17082.97s]  We could also invade here. Oh, that's so unlucky
[17082.97s -> 17120.29s]  lucky. That was such a close Q. Kill that guy. Jesus Christ. I feel like we should have
[17120.29s -> 17126.01s]  won that fight. I feel like something awkward happened and we lost. Did my Ashe just walk
[17126.01s -> 17131.21s]  directly into the Sakali and not use her ulti? Use your ulti. You have ulti. Use
[17131.21s -> 17150.27s]  your ulti. Oh my god. What the fuck. Oh my god. I don't even know what to say
[17150.27s -> 17157.15s]  right now. This is insane. This genuinely feels like everybody in the game is losing their mind
[17157.71s -> 17165.60s]  in the freest game I've ever seen in my life. Like that's what we're losing to right there,
[17165.60s -> 17172.40s]  that guy. The guy who like doesn't understand how Senna works. Like that player. That's why
[17172.40s -> 17178.40s]  I'm frustrated. Like that player right there has no idea how Senna works, tries to fight me.
[17178.40s -> 17182.40s]  I'm trying really hard not to be an asshole, but like it's flooding out right now from these games
[17184.40s -> 17193.38s]  It's crazy like he's so toxic. Look at this. He went proto belt. I only a boot
[17195.38s -> 17202.38s]  Nico but like what that doesn't do anything to help his team. You could arrow that guy. I mean, it's not impossible
[17219.32s -> 17223.32s]  Or don't that's fine. Oh my god
[17223.32s -> 17225.32s]  Or don't that's fine
[17236.01s -> 17243.03s]  Oh my god
[17243.11s -> 17245.11s]  Guys, I think my lux is afk
[17248.01s -> 17250.09s]  She's been sitting in base for like five minutes
[17256.49s -> 17258.49s]  I think she's like
[17258.49s -> 17260.49s]  Literally just throwing there some bits
[17261.13s -> 17273.46s]  All right, let's push this wave
[17273.46s -> 17275.46s]  We could make a pick right now
[17280.38s -> 17283.26s]  Jax, what are you doing, man? Why are you up there? Oh, no
[17285.69s -> 17288.65s]  Also, why does this ash have the worst build i've ever seen
[17289.29s -> 17298.66s]  Dude, if we lose to the Kai'sa that just did that I'm gonna lose my mind
[17299.46s -> 17318.58s]  Wait, I just blind art in without any vision of anybody and just died
[17319.34s -> 17321.34s]  There's just no way we can lose this
[17324.28s -> 17326.28s]  We got this guys just play
[17326.60s -> 17332.15s]  like I just need to I need help getting vision control on Baron and
[17332.75s -> 17334.75s]  Mid and then we can we can win
[17335.27s -> 17336.83s]  We got this
[17336.83s -> 17418.71s]  Right now. I mean we still got Baron, but he did get two of them. I guess
[17419.27s -> 17423.10s]  Or no, we only yeah, you got card this in ash
[17423.10s -> 17426.90s]  topazshot883 But we did get baron which is very nice so
[17426.90s -> 17439.35s]  I'm gonna go doms this game I'm gonna go
[17439.35s -> 17457.06s]  Black Cleaver but I think I'm gonna go doms I need to get vision control on dragon and
[17457.06s -> 17472.39s]  mid I need to get vision control and I need I
[17472.39s -> 17484.12s]  need help to do it though I'm gonna act like I'm backing here
[17484.12s -> 17488.60s]  we should just be pushing mid with baron I don't know what we're doing
[17488.60s -> 17491.32s]  Like lowkey, it should just be straight up like we go mid with baron here
[17502.95s -> 17504.95s]  What the fuck was that? That was a terrible play
[17522.12s -> 17524.12s]  Guys just just come mid. We have baron
[17533.94s -> 17536.10s]  Nice huge pick push mid push mid
[17537.54s -> 17545.72s]  Fuck dragon just push mid
[17545.72s -> 17551.16s]  Okay. Now we back off
[17551.16s -> 17553.16s]  Oh, I mean that was
[17554.20s -> 17557.66s]  Bad
[17557.66s -> 17559.66s]  Guys back off back off back off leave
[17559.90s -> 17562.22s]  Leave leave leave please. Please just leave
[17566.52s -> 17569.32s]  Guys, you can leave you can leave we just go do dragon leaf
[17570.04s -> 17575.92s]  We still have so much gold to get on the map we can go get bot tier two
[17576.66s -> 17578.66s]  bot tier one bot tier two
[17579.02s -> 17581.66s]  We have we have so much gold to get on the map. It's not a big deal, right?
[17581.66s -> 17585.82s]  like we don't need to end the game right the seconds we actually have Karthus and we have
[17587.62s -> 17633.12s]  Jax too. So like our scaling is really good. I need to go get I need to go get
[17634.32s -> 17636.56s]  My next item, but I need enough gold to do it. I
[17636.56s -> 17638.56s]  I
[17638.76s -> 17640.76s]  Also need to get wards
[17640.76s -> 17644.60s]  This sucks. I'm on like a weird buy timer where like I don't have enough things to get
[17645.12s -> 17647.12s]  You know what? I'm just gonna get my ward item
[17648.00s -> 17651.12s]  I'm gonna grab this for right now just so we can actually get some power on the map
[17651.76s -> 17656.92s]  Cuz the map's so dark and I think getting the ward item before finishing my last whisper items probably the smartest call
[17657.44s -> 17666.62s]  I'm a little concerned why we're not pushing bot with Jax. We're pushing pop
[17668.34s -> 17670.34s]  And I'm also concerned why we're not
[17671.14s -> 17674.26s]  Playing for mid prio and we're just farming bot side
[17675.94s -> 17677.94s]  This is such an awkward fucking thing
[17684.14s -> 17686.86s]  Like we should just be playing for mid prio and use arrow to engage
[17687.50s -> 17690.38s]  That's how we win. We just use arrow to engage when they contest mid
[17691.42s -> 17699.52s]  It's actually that easy
[17699.52s -> 17701.52s]  Like low key. It's actually that easy
[17708.18s -> 17710.18s]  See watch now this guy's dead
[17717.57s -> 17719.57s]  I mean, that's fine with me
[17720.37s -> 17722.37s]  You guys want to int to kill me? That's totally fine
[17736.02s -> 17738.18s]  They can get the inhib and then they can back up
[17739.30s -> 17741.30s]  Yeah, yeah getting hit back up and
[17742.10s -> 17748.66s]  Then play for play for Baron. They'll only have a few seconds to do this though
[17748.66s -> 17751.18s]  So it's kind of scary because these two are gonna be alive
[17752.42s -> 17759.19s]  They need to back immediately
[17759.63s -> 17765.95s]  Just reset you don't need the wave just leave leave leave
[17766.63s -> 17768.99s]  Barons up burns up think about the macro guys the macro
[17769.83s -> 17771.51s]  We play for Baron now
[17771.51s -> 17776.70s]  Because there's a timer now where like you guys just need to reset
[17776.70s -> 17783.18s]  because there's a timer where the enemy has tempo on the map and if we don't if
[17783.18s -> 17787.82s]  we don't allow if we don't reset they'll just rush Baron and there's
[17787.82s -> 17800.53s]  nothing we do about it okay they're not on Baron I think they missed their
[17800.53s -> 17805.94s]  timer they're on it no they're on it they're on it they're on it okay they're
[17805.94s -> 17814.43s]  not on it we're fun we can still fight this though but we need
[17814.43s -> 17825.98s]  everybody here just arrow arrow ash arrow arrow arrow it doesn't matter
[17825.98s -> 17838.06s]  if you hit mouth just arrow just arrow him thank you no no guys the back line the back line
[17841.12s -> 17853.31s]  play together play together yes nice end of the game you end you end here
[17854.67s -> 17860.99s]  lux don't back you are giving me cancer okay they forfeit it dude look how easy that is
[17860.99s -> 17866.03s]  look how easy it is to win games when people are listening to macro look how easy it is
[17866.03s -> 17867.55s]  Oh my god!
[17869.19s -> 17870.23s]  I'm losing it, man.
[17870.23s -> 17871.95s]  I swear to god, I'm losing my hair.
[17871.95s -> 17873.55s]  I can feel my hair falling out right now.
[17873.55s -> 17875.83s]  I can feel it falling out of my fucking head.
[17876.07s -> 17877.39s]  Like, I just lost one.
[17877.39s -> 17877.83s]  It's right there.
[17877.83s -> 17881.47s]  Look, like it's just fucking kill me, man.
[17882.27s -> 17883.19s]  In game.
[17883.19s -> 17885.87s]  God, it's so hard.
[17885.87s -> 17888.03s]  I feel so exhausted.
[17888.51s -> 17895.10s]  Like, it's so exhausting.
[17895.10s -> 17896.46s]  You played a 44 minute gold game?
[17896.46s -> 17898.86s]  God damn.
[17898.86s -> 17903.38s]  That's impressive.
[17903.38s -> 17906.58s]  I don't want to honor any of these people. Who would you guys honor?
[17907.70s -> 17912.74s]  Like out of all of them, who'd you guys pick? Because I don't know they all in my eyes. I'm too toxic right now. They all suck
[17916.18s -> 17920.13s]  Jax, all right. I'll give it to Jax
[17920.13s -> 17922.93s]  Ash, ash was trying. I'll give you that ash was trying
[17926.74s -> 17928.74s]  Dude, look at this lux
[17929.22s -> 17932.26s]  This lux got so fucking carried. Oh my god
[17938.45s -> 17940.45s]  Oh my god
[17941.17s -> 17943.17s]  Don't type to me you
[17944.19s -> 17948.69s]  pedestrian
[17948.69s -> 17964.14s]  this man called him a pedestrian that's not even an insult like oh yeah yeah wow
[17964.14s -> 17991.98s]  fucking pedestrian like it's not even an insult man dude guys i feel like part of my life gets
[17991.98s -> 17997.74s]  taken away you know like when i play on my main account i'm like super sweaty tryharding and
[17997.74s -> 18002.30s]  shit i feel like i feel like i'm losing like yeah it's like it's like every time i lose it's like
[18002.30s -> 18005.42s]  One hair or like every time I'm like barely win, right?
[18005.42s -> 18009.90s]  It's just like every game in this ELO is like one hair on my head gets fucking burnt out
[18009.90s -> 18012.70s]  And it just leaves and I'm not like I'm gonna be looking like Homer Simpson
[18013.18s -> 18037.41s]  Like look at the difference in wards place. This is what annoys me about bad support players
[18038.17s -> 18040.17s]  This guy plays 23
[18041.05s -> 18044.73s]  He's more focused on getting kills than placing wards and it's really stupid
[18050.88s -> 18052.40s]  Sorry, I just don't listen
[18052.40s -> 18055.68s]  I don't have anything against the dog lightning guy as like it's a person other than like
[18055.68s -> 18061.18s]  You're gonna be like, what I've seen on his stream, right? Like on his stream. He just seems really egotistical
[18062.84s -> 18068.52s]  Like he's like everything I hate in the average league player, he's really has a massive ego
[18069.48s -> 18073.18s]  Because he reached challenger on the support role on like an off-metapick
[18073.60s -> 18076.60s]  Like last year at some point or something or maybe he's challenger right now
[18076.60s -> 18079.30s]  I don't even know maybe he has an account in challenger
[18079.30s -> 18082.60s]  I don't even know but it drives me crazy because like
[18083.12s -> 18086.50s]  He doesn't do anything correctly
[18087.06s -> 18093.06s]  like he gets away with such dumb shit because he like he like basically wins lane because he plays
[18093.06s -> 18098.90s]  extremely aggressively but if you guys noticed in that game the reason we won lane or we were able
[18098.90s -> 18103.86s]  to push back is because they they played aggressively but they did it really stupidly
[18104.42s -> 18108.82s]  like they were fighting us in our own waves right like on repeat they were just fighting
[18108.82s -> 18113.46s]  us in our own waves every time i would just turn a one for one almost a one for two every
[18113.46s -> 18117.94s]  time and it's it's stupid because every time that's happening they're also giving me souls right
[18117.94s -> 18122.18s]  and he would like take weird fights and like i know he's probably for fun and he doesn't care
[18122.18s -> 18125.86s]  it's a smurf blah blah blah but i just don't like when people like that like ego their ass
[18125.86s -> 18136.75s]  off when they play so badly it drives me crazy why do i care so much i don't know
[18137.87s -> 18163.02s]  i don't know how are you guys doing by the way how's everybody's day going in chat what
[18163.02s -> 18164.34s]  What'd you guys up to? Talk to me.
[18165.22s -> 18167.94s]  I know I stopped like teaching the game and started whining.
[18168.06s -> 18172.06s]  Like I got on my main account a few hours ago and I stopped teaching and I started whining a bunch.
[18172.06s -> 18179.53s]  So my bad, my bad on that one dudes.
[18180.37s -> 18181.25s]  How you guys doing now?
[18181.33s -> 18182.21s]  How's everybody's day gone?
[18189.50s -> 18190.86s]  When the coaching services open?
[18190.94s -> 18194.98s]  Oh, I could probably do coaching at some point soon.
[18196.10s -> 18201.34s]  Like I'd be willing to do some coaching, some like sub coaching or something or like something like that.
[18201.42s -> 18202.10s]  It might be fun.
[18211.68s -> 18214.72s]  Sucking in bronze, you don't get enough time to actually improve. Did I feel that man?
[18214.80s -> 18219.12s]  It takes a long time league is not an easy game to pick up and start playing right
[18219.76s -> 18222.48s]  Like if you're if you're in bronze or silver and you're like, oh, I actually you know
[18222.48s -> 18224.56s]  I'm having fun playing the game. I kind of want to try and get better
[18225.12s -> 18228.96s]  It's you're just overwhelmed with so much info that you like have to play so many games
[18230.16s -> 18235.39s]  Right, like I I feel you man
[18235.39s -> 18245.36s]  Like it's it's overwhelming
[18245.60s -> 18247.60s]  Yeah, I I feel you
[18256.02s -> 18258.02s]  Well, we got mid. Okay
[18258.10s -> 18259.30s]  uh
[18259.30s -> 18266.00s]  Should I just play Trist? Well I'm worried if I pick Trist that we won't have AP but
[18266.96s -> 18280.51s]  I also think I'm better at Trist than I am at like other stuff so I don't know. AP Varus?
[18281.55s -> 18289.36s]  I'm not good enough at AP Varus man I'm gonna be real. Well my Malz is good but the problem
[18289.36s -> 18296.16s]  with Malz is like Malz is a shitty champion like Malz is trash right so like he's good but
[18296.16s -> 18302.24s]  he's like not good in the sense of like i can play him well but at the end of the day if they pick
[18302.24s -> 18310.86s]  something that like counters mouths i just lose whereas like tristana is just free to pick
[18312.06s -> 18316.78s]  like even if we play all ad right let's say we do all ad or some shit like on accident or
[18316.78s -> 18321.50s]  because people are one tricks blah blah blah it's it's still free like tristana is still like
[18321.50s -> 18327.34s]  a good pick because even with all ad she's still like you can build lord doms she has
[18327.34s -> 18332.34s]  justbaskedbomba Yeah, I think that's just incredibly high pressure early game if you play it right, right like you could push the waves roam
[18332.34s -> 18337.34s]  justbaskedbomba You can you can roam top rumbot help lanes out like level two three. You can invade junglers early
[18337.34s -> 18343.85s]  justbaskedbomba Like she's just incredibly incredibly strong this guy should go pike
[18343.85s -> 18348.85s]  justbaskedbomba I was gonna say they pick new new and I picked an 80 mid they picked new new
[18348.85s -> 18353.85s]  justbaskedbomba and thresh we should have an engage
[18353.85s -> 18356.93s]  justbaskedBot I can just walk bot on repeat now and pretty
[18356.93s -> 18368.26s]  much kill people.
[18368.26s -> 18369.26s]  Watch an iron game.
[18369.26s -> 18370.26s]  Watching an iron game.
[18370.26s -> 18376.43s]  I feel like it wouldn't be an actual iron game though, would it?
[18376.43s -> 18383.91s]  I had friends who intentionally lost a bunch of games and so they could get to iron 4.
[18383.91s -> 18391.83s]  They like inted down to iron 4 or whatever to see if they could make it.
[18391.83s -> 18396.47s]  There's just so many smurfs in iron.
[18396.47s -> 18400.95s]  There's like legitimate bot, bot accounts.
[18400.95s -> 18404.17s]  Like like accounts that are like being bodied, right?
[18404.17s -> 18416.02s]  There's like bought of the counts and iron there's like smurfs all over the place.
[18416.02s -> 18417.10s]  It seems to have stopped.
[18417.10s -> 18421.90s]  I wonder if riot like did something that stopped the bots.
[18421.90s -> 18424.66s]  They must they may have like they may have just think incorporated something that like
[18424.66s -> 18430.06s]  stops the software.
[18430.06s -> 18431.06s]  But I don't know.
[18431.06s -> 18434.78s]  I haven't heard anything about it, but I have no clue.
[18434.78s -> 18435.78s]  I'll be real.
[18435.78s -> 18460.37s]  I don't know.
[18460.37s -> 18470.53s]  fall you around last game i got boots one dude that sounds awful i kind of feel bad for actual
[18471.17s -> 18478.37s]  iron players who are like in iron trying to climb because like that sounds bad
[18492.62s -> 18496.22s]  i do think you can climb obviously out of any elo it doesn't matter right like if i were to
[18496.22s -> 18502.82s]  go into an iron game i'd probably drop like 50 kills but i so i do think you can climb out of
[18502.82s -> 18522.26s]  any you know any elo for sure you'll have a new account if you had a bot of the account
[18522.26s -> 18527.30s]  That answered every time I wrote bot
[18530.74s -> 18539.71s]  That's funny
[18539.71s -> 18541.39s]  Yeah, I assume that's a good point
[18541.39s -> 18546.19s]  I guess if you're in iron you could like play to learn the game a bit better and then you could like play a new
[18546.19s -> 18547.71s]  Account and see where you got
[18547.71s -> 18549.71s]  Yeah, no, that would work
[18549.87s -> 18557.04s]  That makes sense
[18557.04s -> 18558.96s]  Sure. I'll first pick men
[18558.96s -> 18563.10s]  I'll first pick senna
[18563.18s -> 18565.50s]  I I guarantee they lock in fucking
[18566.46s -> 18569.50s]  These people are gonna lock in fucking uh nautilus or some shits
[18569.50s -> 18583.42s]  It'll be like Jarvan, Nautilus, I don't even know.
[18583.42s -> 18585.94s]  Ribbon's not too bad for Senna, it's okay to get flanks.
[18585.94s -> 18588.14s]  I actually don't think Ribbon's too bad right now.
[18588.14s -> 18590.98s]  Maybe all the Riven players I've played against suck, but I don't think she's actually
[18590.98s -> 18592.18s]  that bad.
[18592.18s -> 18595.00s]  I think Ribbon's like just you have to position well.
[18595.00s -> 18598.80s]  I think Ribbon's really broken at abusing positioning.
[18598.80s -> 18600.98s]  That's why she's so good in solo queue.
[18600.98s -> 18606.50s]  good riven players i'll get really gross flanks and the flanks are what's op yeah there's the
[18606.50s -> 18612.60s]  gragas okay i was like they're gonna pick something to fuck me over this guy picked gragas
[18612.60s -> 18617.32s]  but it was gonna be like j4 or gragas or something and then this guy is the support
[18617.32s -> 18623.96s]  he'll probably pick nautilus unless he's a one trick right like unless this guy's straight up
[18623.96s -> 18631.24s]  just like a one trick he'll pick like nautilus or some shits maybe rakan rakan or nautilus
[18631.24s -> 18642.09s]  Because if he picks an enchanter, we just win the game.
[18642.09s -> 18647.86s]  He has to pick engage.
[18647.86s -> 18651.26s]  Melio would be really good here too, actually.
[18651.26s -> 18653.76s]  Because Melio would counter half our team.
[18653.76s -> 18657.46s]  You can Melio Q, Wukong, and Kennen and engage.
[18657.46s -> 18663.60s]  Like if this guy played Melio, this would actually be a hard lane.
[18663.60s -> 18664.60s]  Tom Kinch?
[18664.60s -> 18670.25s]  I mean, I get it.
[18670.25s -> 18671.95s]  But I think it's bad.
[18671.95s -> 18673.39s]  Runes?
[18673.39s -> 18674.91s]  Oh shit.
[18674.91s -> 18679.67s]  Yo, you just saved me looking like an absolute fool.
[18679.67s -> 18680.67s]  Thank you.
[18680.67s -> 18682.67s]  Holy crap.
[18682.67s -> 18684.67s]  If you wanted to see my runes, they're here, but thank you, you reminded me.
[18684.67s -> 18685.67s]  Here, I'm gonna be over here.
[18685.67s -> 18686.67s]  I'm gonna get some water.
[18686.67s -> 18687.67s]  I'll be right back.
[18687.67s -> 18688.67s]  Get some aqua.
[18688.67s -> 18735.13s]  By the way, the people who are here to watch me play AD Carry, I sincerely apologize.
[18735.13s -> 18743.26s]  I know watching me play Senna is probably boring as fuck, okay?
[18743.26s -> 18744.26s]  I know.
[18744.26s -> 18749.48s]  And I promise you we will play ad carry at some point. I promise you I
[18749.94s -> 18753.94s]  Played like the first four hours of the stream was ad carry or the first three, right?
[18753.94s -> 18757.06s]  I played on my smurf for a few games and played some ad so if you want to watch that you can go back
[18757.06s -> 18759.22s]  In the bond we did some my commentary and shit
[18761.26s -> 18765.26s]  The only reason I'm playing so much Senna and support on this account is because like
[18766.26s -> 18771.46s]  there the the elo I'm currently in is like the worst elo to climb in solo queue because of a
[18772.02s -> 18774.02s]  lot of factors and
[18774.58s -> 18777.06s]  Support has some of the highest impact on the game
[18779.34s -> 18785.62s]  Whereas like 80k has high impact late, but in in solo queue you want to have high impact early and I wanted to be able to
[18786.66s -> 18822.50s]  Impact the game really early on so yeah, sorry about being you know boring and shit. I just really want to like win games
[18824.06s -> 18825.34s]  At least on this accounts
[18825.34s -> 18830.02s]  I want to get out of the silo because the faster I get out of the silo the the faster
[18830.62s -> 18843.58s]  the faster you got to see load the faster I can
[18845.02s -> 18847.46s]  Have fun playing ad carry and like trying climb
[18849.24s -> 18851.24s]  What a weird
[18851.44s -> 18856.20s]  Like what a weird play by these guys. What the fuck they like half shoved the waves
[18856.96s -> 18873.97s]  To get like early bush control and then they did shit like that. This guy's just dead. I'm gonna give it to twitch
[18874.69s -> 18884.40s]  Nice, we got his exhausts. So I wasted my exhaust there. I did it because I thought the jinx was gonna insta flash
[18884.40s -> 18888.64s]  Like I didn't exhaust because I was like scared of her damage
[18888.64s -> 18893.04s]  I did it because I thought she was gonna like try and flash away the second that's
[18894.88s -> 18897.60s]  But I I landed my snare it was kind of bad by me
[18897.60s -> 18901.04s]  I mean I landed my snare so I didn't need to exhaust her. I just was like, oh, maybe she'll flash
[18901.72s -> 18903.72s]  She did not she did not flash
[18905.16s -> 18908.42s]  What do you was this this 500 LP masters 400 LP
[18910.28s -> 18912.28s]  Insane I know
[18912.28s -> 18938.03s]  Absolutely crazy put that ward there because Gragas is probably bot, you know
[18939.75s -> 18948.12s]  So
[18948.12s -> 18955.12s]  Mmm, they're trying to come up from bot to kill me here like their bot lanes rotating up to try and kill me
[18956.44s -> 18961.32s]  So just be careful twitch there they're in here man. I
[18962.56s -> 18976.40s]  Actually have to back and walk look this is hilarious the enemy bobbing literally just roaming mid. Look at this
[18977.34s -> 18980.54s]  What?
[18980.54s -> 18981.98s]  Why?
[18981.98s -> 18993.11s]  I'm not trying to soak his XP. I just want those souls. I'm scared to walk in here. I don't know where Gragas is
[18993.11s -> 19008.19s]  I gotta come bot to help my twitch so they don't freeze the wave
[19008.69s -> 19013.55s]  Like I don't want them to be able to freeze here
[19015.70s -> 19018.04s]  Even if Gragas ganks we win we win the fight right now
[19020.17s -> 19024.45s]  Like it's an easy fight win as long as you don't get knocked up. We just win the fight automatically
[19024.45s -> 19035.14s]  I actually we're trying to bait Gragas to come gank this
[19043.46s -> 19044.74s]  easy
[19044.74s -> 19046.74s]  double flashes, baby easy
[19046.74s -> 19065.92s]  You fucking cowards we should back up I
[19066.60s -> 19068.32s]  Can go by now Oh
[19068.32s -> 19069.68s]  Greg is the top
[19069.68s -> 19071.68s]  We could actually maybe do dragon
[19071.92s -> 19078.42s]  You know, I'm gonna be real a soul roaming is not a not in like the top list of me being like nervous about it
[19079.28s -> 19082.66s]  Like I'm not nervous about a soul roaming man
[19086.14s -> 19088.68s]  Push this so we can oh we're diving them
[19089.70s -> 19093.30s]  That's a bit scary. Welcome to the League of Draven
[19094.10s -> 19096.34s]  Good to see you're back to enjoying the game
[19097.18s -> 19099.46s]  Whoa, Wukong's still diving that? That's not good.
[19100.42s -> 19101.62s]  Like, we back off here, man.
[19107.08s -> 19109.40s]  I mean, we can maybe go up here if you really want to.
[19115.42s -> 19116.58s]  I kind of want to ward this.
[19123.46s -> 19125.46s]  I need to reset, though, really badly right now.
[19130.47s -> 19131.31s]  Like, really badly.
[19133.47s -> 19135.71s]  Not being on the map here is really bad.
[19137.31s -> 19141.23s]  Or rather, not, like, having, uh, gold spent and being on the map is what I'm meant to say.
[19141.23s -> 19142.35s]  Like, it's really fucking bad.
[19143.39s -> 19144.11s]  Yo, back up.
[19144.11s -> 19146.75s]  You know Gragas that you watched him walk past three wards
[19148.03s -> 19150.55s]  That's why I just warded. No, no, he's still here
[19151.43s -> 19153.43s]  Gragas is right there
[19154.23s -> 19165.03s]  Like we know Gragas is somewhere bot lane right now. I don't know where but we know he's there they're on dragon. Okay
[19165.93s -> 19167.93s]  We can fight this go go go
[19168.33s -> 19186.65s]  W over I'm here. Nice. Yo, come here
[19188.13s -> 19191.09s]  Yeah, I'll help you come get come get this come get this motherfuckers blue I
[19191.09s -> 19220.28s]  I got you baby. What the fuck made a bitch
[19221.36s -> 19228.96s]  Well, I guess I'll back
[19230.08s -> 19234.52s]  Yo Spartan, thank you for the six months man. Welcome back appreciate it
[19235.88s -> 19238.64s]  This will back we'll get our fucking umbral
[19239.96s -> 19241.96s]  I'm gonna go top side of the map now
[19242.60s -> 19244.80s]  And I'm gonna help my team get rift heralds
[19245.60s -> 19248.50s]  I'm gonna ping I want to go top side. I want to help my team get rifts
[19249.14s -> 19259.30s]  The wave if we look at bot wave, it's pushing into us. It's totally fine
[19260.18s -> 19262.18s]  Okay, which is level six
[19263.60s -> 19286.59s]  The bot waves pushing in we are totally fine to do what I'm doing right now. He doesn't know I'm here. I'm dead though
[19293.27s -> 19296.77s]  bro
[19296.77s -> 19299.01s]  No joke. I almost juked that
[19300.29s -> 19305.47s]  That's so close. I was hoping like Wukong for some reason didn't walk top side
[19305.47s -> 19308.47s]  But the enemy bot lane did?
[19308.47s -> 19314.83s]  Okay, the enemy bot lane just griefed their entire game.
[19314.83s -> 19316.83s]  The game's over, we win.
[19316.83s -> 19319.83s]  What the fuck are they doing? What is happening?
[19319.83s -> 19324.53s]  Like, my Twitch is just getting free plays.
[19324.53s -> 19339.94s]  Wait, you guys are griefing.
[19339.94s -> 19341.94s]  I'm griefing.
[19341.94s -> 19343.94s]  Dude, what the fuck?
[19343.94s -> 19345.94s]  Why would you fight them?
[19345.94s -> 19349.94s]  Guys, guys, guys, Wukong.
[19349.94s -> 19350.94s]  Wukong!
[19350.94s -> 19356.98s]  Okay, we see that our twitch is getting free plates bought free first turret. Okay, I'm backed
[19356.98s -> 19363.42s]  I almost soloed their ad carry. Okay, or their jungler. Why would you ever on purpose?
[19364.22s -> 19369.12s]  Take a for a fight like that with no. Oh, I have cancer. I
[19370.26s -> 19371.36s]  also
[19371.36s -> 19377.94s]  The Wukong's an idiot. He doesn't understand macro at all apparently because I literally pinged to come to rift
[19378.06s -> 19380.06s]  My Wukong was like nervous
[19380.94s -> 19387.60s]  Like, for some reason Wukong didn't walk top, he sat bot trying to gank.
[19387.60s -> 19394.10s]  But the objective was Rift, not- God, I'm losing my mind in this ELO.
[19394.10s -> 19399.18s]  Masters players are literally just diamond players with slightly better mechanics.
[19399.18s -> 19402.42s]  They don't know anything about the game, and I'm about to- my brain's about to explode
[19402.42s -> 19405.24s]  like a peanut.
[19405.24s -> 19409.44s]  It's not about them laning 2v2, you fucking cumquat.
[19409.44s -> 19412.82s]  Dude, I know they can't lane against us 2v2.
[19412.82s -> 19414.52s]  It's not about the 2v2, man.
[19414.52s -> 19419.52s]  We get a free rift, Harold, because we shut down their bot lane and I'm on an item spike.
[19419.52s -> 19421.90s]  So we just automatically get a free rift.
[19421.90s -> 19427.01s]  It has nothing to do with 2v2.
[19427.01s -> 19433.89s]  This kumquat motherfucker.
[19433.89s -> 19435.93s]  I don't know why that's my insult.
[19435.93s -> 19438.17s]  The pedestrian guy got to me.
[19438.17s -> 19439.17s]  Somehow.
[19439.17s -> 19449.10s]  Where the fuck is this ward?
[19449.10s -> 19450.10s]  Oh.
[19450.10s -> 19460.22s]  Because I'm telling you right now, my macro there was 100% correct, by the way.
[19460.22s -> 19461.22s]  Like 1000%.
[19461.22s -> 19475.49s]  Like even though I died, I know it was correct. No, no, just do dragon do not dive
[19476.41s -> 19479.85s]  Guys, we don't have to not everything's about kills. Not everything's about kills. We got this
[19481.03s -> 19484.29s]  Like you don't need to dive. You don't need to dive always you don't need to see a kill be like
[19484.29s -> 19492.29s]  Oh monkey kill brain go like the game is about like getting objectives on timers and playing off of tempo and things like that
[19492.81s -> 19498.31s]  Like the only reason we even lost rift was because my Wukong went full monkey brain and was like no
[19498.31s -> 19502.01s]  We need to not play for this rift with a giant massive lead
[19522.28s -> 19528.31s]  Wait kill this guy
[19528.31s -> 19530.31s]  What am I watching right now?
[19531.83s -> 19538.83s]  This is outrageous my Wukong just solo ulted there, dude, I'm gonna lose it my Wukong just solo ulted their Gragas
[19539.43s -> 19551.44s]  on a good note, though
[19551.92s -> 19554.78s]  They don't get any plates off of rifting. So it's not that bad
[19556.52s -> 19562.43s]  Okay, man, just push like dude hit the minions like stop my bad
[19563.71s -> 19567.51s]  Sorry, I'm wound up right now Kenan. Okay, I'm a little wound
[19568.55s -> 19570.55s]  Apologies if I if I griefed you man
[19572.23s -> 19574.23s]  It's fine
[19574.39s -> 19576.39s]  So the wound up it's fine. I
[19576.95s -> 19582.71s]  Just don't like when like stuff like that happens. I'm a perfectionist and it's my big I talked about this earlier
[19582.75s -> 19586.01s]  I'm a perfectionist. My biggest flaw is that like I will
[19587.11s -> 19590.35s]  Play the game a hundred percent correctly on like tempo and timers
[19590.35s -> 19594.79s]  But you can't do that because you got to remember to like your teammates or teammates
[19598.34s -> 19601.92s]  Like they're not just gonna instantly know exactly what you're what what to do
[19603.06s -> 19616.79s]  We win that guy. Don't just stand here and watch me die, man
[19617.89s -> 19619.89s]  Holy shit
[19623.47s -> 19628.07s]  That is oh my god, if he if he had let me die there I might have screamed
[19629.27s -> 19631.71s]  actually screamed out loud in anger
[19631.71s -> 19640.63s]  Like dude is watching me kite these people within one inch of my life and instead of like
[19640.63s -> 19645.59s]  helping or walking up and doing anything, you know what he does?
[19645.59s -> 19647.19s]  He pulls a fucking growth score.
[19647.19s -> 19652.25s]  My man just likes to watch.
[19652.25s -> 19672.14s]  Something wrong with it, but you know, there's a time and a place.
[19672.14s -> 19675.90s]  I don't actually want to buy pinks because I don't think we're strong enough that uh,
[19675.90s -> 19678.06s]  I don't think that we're strong enough that I can actually even defend the pinks
[19678.06s -> 19679.06s]  right now if I'm being honest.
[19679.06s -> 19683.26s]  Like we should be strong enough, but we kind of threw our lead when I over forced
[19683.26s -> 19698.94s]  the rift so I think I think we need to push this wave so that we can get tempo
[19698.94s -> 19710.58s]  and move around the map prio sorry I keep saying the wrong thing oh that guy's
[19710.58s -> 19716.78s]  dead I have to ditch that guy he's dead as fuck oh I'm dead too maybe oh I
[19716.78s -> 19722.98s]  am so dead yeah that was my bad that was my bad my bad my bad like I we
[19722.98s -> 19730.16s]  just got we just got ran down that was on me like we we had good positioning
[19730.16s -> 19737.92s]  but the jungler wasn't close enough so this is my then I also didn't expect to
[19737.92s -> 19743.95s]  get fucking four man's but I should have right we should play for this
[19743.95s -> 19749.67s]  though I wish I could type I wish I wasn't chat restricted for a year dude
[19749.67s -> 19754.33s]  I swear to God I'm not even being mean like riot was like they chat
[19754.33s -> 19758.39s]  restricted me because I type so much macro that it gets on people's nerves
[19758.39s -> 19765.03s]  And they don't want me spam typing
[19765.27s -> 19766.23s]  Loki
[19766.23s -> 19780.65s]  Don't play rip. Don't play for rifts. I need help guys if you guys can help
[19781.89s -> 19800.55s]  We need to clear vision on dragon a year. Yeah, I get uncharted started April 15th or April 11th or some shit
[19801.97s -> 19803.97s]  2024
[19804.13s -> 19808.37s]  I've never seen it. It must have been like an actual rider or something
[19808.61s -> 19812.05s]  Like I've never seen an automated system give you a year chat restricts, right?
[19812.05s -> 19815.01s]  So in my mind, it's got to be like an actual like
[19817.52s -> 19819.52s]  Like a rioter was like Geronimo
[19820.56s -> 19823.08s]  We know you're good enough to climb but stop typing
[19824.68s -> 19834.31s]  You know, I mean that's like what must have been going on and I'm like, okay well
[19835.43s -> 19851.82s]  sure, I
[19851.82s -> 19853.82s]  Mean, I didn't know you could get chat banned a year
[19854.46s -> 19857.34s]  What's weird is like I said, I don't like say trigger words
[19857.34s -> 19859.52s]  It's not like I tell people to like end themselves and stuff
[19859.52s -> 19865.04s]  It's mainly just me typing like go here do that do this like I type a lot, right?
[19865.28s -> 19869.08s]  Which is obviously like if you type a lot it can be toxic as well. So
[19872.82s -> 19874.82s]  Like typing a lot annoying so I get it
[19886.21s -> 19889.39s]  We should be playing for Baron side vision right now. Not
[19890.57s -> 19893.43s]  The vision we're playing with right now is bad. We should be playing over here
[19895.13s -> 19899.09s]  Like I want to play for Baron vision, but it's a little hard to do that right now
[19899.09s -> 19907.92s]  Because you see how Tom Kenshin me are like transferring vision control around the map right now
[19908.40s -> 19912.04s]  We're playing this little support game of like hide the vision
[19913.48s -> 19915.48s]  Look at this fuck
[19931.10s -> 19952.71s]  Oh, he's so dumb I still think he's dumb how did I just take
[19958.61s -> 19960.61s]  tonight I
[19960.61s -> 19962.61s]  Took my entire HP bar on a global
[19964.66s -> 19965.92s]  my bad
[19965.92s -> 19968.70s]  Dude, I really wish the mouthlight would group though. I
[19969.80s -> 19973.30s]  Get that he's like doing the thing where he's like, oh, let's you know split
[19973.30s -> 19975.98s]  I like his play was actually really smart there
[19976.56s -> 19980.62s]  The mouth lights play I mean like that wasn't his fault that we got shit on at all
[19980.62s -> 19985.48s]  I just wish they would group because if he groups up and hits are we win every team fight
[19986.30s -> 19991.28s]  Because right now our only frontliner is the Wukong right and the fact that Wukong's our frontliner
[19991.28s -> 19993.28s]  We don't have the ability to play the game
[19994.72s -> 19996.72s]  When I get stuck on that what the fuck was that
[19998.00s -> 20004.84s]  Like that Tom kinch getting to eat forward like that blindly into our entire team and then not getting punished for it
[20004.84s -> 20007.24s]  Might be the most like solo queue thing I've ever seen
[20007.84s -> 20009.84s]  Nobody wanted to hit him because he was the tank
[20010.24s -> 20012.24s]  but uh
[20012.44s -> 20015.00s]  Yeah, that's we should still kill him, you know
[20020.81s -> 20024.37s]  We can fight this guy. Oh my god jungler just come. Oh
[20024.37s -> 20028.11s]  Oh, we're forfeiting. Oh, okay. Now that makes perfect sense, right?
[20030.29s -> 20031.89s]  Just come group
[20031.89s -> 20034.51s]  Bro, Kenan come group, please guys
[20035.21s -> 20038.85s]  Like I don't know why everybody's frustrated. We're literally still up in gold
[20039.73s -> 20041.89s]  Please come group up. We just took an inhibitor
[20042.81s -> 20044.81s]  Just just come group
[20045.77s -> 20048.81s]  Help me get vision on this dragon so that I don't so we don't die
[20049.53s -> 20052.81s]  Like I need my team to actually walk over here to help me get vision
[20053.49s -> 20059.82s]  It's really frustrating because I need the frontliners the wukong in the mouth fight to walk in with me
[20060.44s -> 20064.44s]  Because I'm a little fucking why I have a big gun, but I'm a big gun girl, right?
[20064.60s -> 20068.92s]  So I need I need these two guys to walk in with me these two big burly mountain men
[20074.36s -> 20076.36s]  So that I can play the game, you know
[20076.36s -> 20080.44s]  No, we don't push bot. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no mid
[20080.96s -> 20082.96s]  No, but is worthless come in
[20083.36s -> 20085.76s]  My mouth fights pushing the wave that we already have down. I
[20086.44s -> 20088.44s]  wish I could macro I
[20088.44s -> 20092.12s]  I wish I could type some macro right now. They're they're like my team is so lost
[20094.94s -> 20097.02s]  They're so beyond lost right now. It's crazy
[20099.13s -> 20108.88s]  They're lost this shit
[20108.88s -> 20112.08s]  Just do two dragon. Yes, just do this just do i'll start it for you. Here you go
[20113.12s -> 20116.80s]  I don't know why we're standing in a bush waiting for them to face check two dragon guys
[20121.80s -> 20126.20s]  I swear to god you have to do everything in the zero where you have to start every fight
[20126.68s -> 20128.68s]  I have to basically I have to start every fight
[20129.40s -> 20133.72s]  Right. I have to not only start every fight, but I have to like ping my team what to do exactly
[20133.80s -> 20139.64s]  Because everybody plays so safe in this elo. Why did my Malphite just stop his back?
[20141.50s -> 20153.73s]  Why are you all fighting? Oh my god, please guys. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine
[20155.13s -> 20162.63s]  No Malphite, you can't 1v9 that just back off. They didn't get anything. They didn't get anything. We got dragon. We're on dragon soul points
[20164.41s -> 20169.33s]  I'm losing hairs. I'm losing fucking hairs man. I ain't got many hairs to spare anymore
[20169.89s -> 20171.77s]  We're out here losing hair
[20171.77s -> 20180.60s]  It's like I'm babysitting like this has got to be what a preschool teacher feels like, you know
[20181.24s -> 20185.92s]  Like low-key like preschool teacher just feels feels like this. This has to be it
[20191.16s -> 20197.24s]  like watch it's like watching a toddler like you watch them from the corner, right and they're like eating glue and you're like I
[20197.80s -> 20202.20s]  Mean that's bad. And then you tell them like don't eat glue. Don't eat glue Timmy and he's like, okay
[20202.20s -> 20206.20s]  And then like you leave him there for five minutes to go like do something to watch somebody else
[20206.20s -> 20212.32s]  then all of a sudden Timmy's eating glue again and you're like bro bro we just
[20212.32s -> 20222.81s]  had this discussion and it's like not Timmy's fault right because he's a
[20222.81s -> 20228.29s]  toddler so you can't be mad at Timmy because he's a toddler you can't but
[20228.29s -> 20242.94s]  it's like it's frustrating it's like god damn it man like what is what is

[20524.43s -> 20525.99s]  Oh
[20525.99s -> 20529.91s]  My god, Walter White is like my hero right now
[20529.91s -> 20535.87s]  I don't even understand like I feel like every like I feel like what Walter White felt like dealing with
[20536.27s -> 20539.27s]  Skyler for literally three years like this is outrageous
[20540.27s -> 20547.84s]  This is what this feels like like I do I I can relate to the show so much more. Oh my god
[20548.36s -> 20552.25s]  Like dude, I oh
[20576.16s -> 20578.16s]  crap
[20578.16s -> 20582.64s]  3rd look at just look at the like look at like what's going on in the game
[20583.16s -> 20593.42s]  Like I I don't even mean to be mean about this. It's just this is this is crazy
[20596.97s -> 20598.97s]  Malfight don't pop it off
[20599.57s -> 20620.70s]  Malfight pop it off. Like what do you know is this guy? Oh, he's literally diamond. Why is this guy in this game?
[20620.70s -> 20622.70s]  I mean, I feel I feel like
[20623.14s -> 20627.02s]  Confused now. I'm not even blaming the Wukong anymore. I don't know why this guy is in the game. Oh
[20627.02s -> 20638.51s]  Oh, he has inflated as MMR. Oh, he just has previous season inflated MMR. That's what
[20638.51s -> 20644.53s]  this is. Because he was GM for three years. So the his MMR says that he like belongs
[20644.53s -> 20647.23s]  here even though he doesn't play like I bet you last season he only played like
[20647.23s -> 20654.04s]  50 games. I can look right? We just see like how many games he played. Yeah, he
[20654.04s -> 20658.32s]  played he played like 50 games last season. So like his MMR didn't really change. He
[20658.32s -> 20662.32s]  just got masters and then stopped which is fine there's nothing wrong with that
[20670.70s -> 20676.78s]  i just wish he would chill you know like like uh not rage quit halfway through the game
[20679.45s -> 20683.45s]  because like i said people's elo and shit used to bother me a lot i don't i don't get bothered by
[20683.45s -> 20687.37s]  anymore because i realized it was cringe i don't care about their elo and shit what what i care
[20687.37s -> 20690.57s]  about is like i just want them to play the game you know what i mean like i just want them
[20690.57s -> 20694.89s]  to not rage not not like be absolute apes in the game and just play that's all i ask for
[20694.89s -> 20699.01s]  I don't care if you're a diamond player a player in the game and you're just like accidentally in the game
[20699.01s -> 20701.17s]  It's not your fault. I just want you to push buttons
[20705.35s -> 20707.51s]  What I'm doing wrong to have a 36% win rate
[20707.51s -> 20714.48s]  I can't see the link cuz just you'd have to give me your name and your server
[20714.96s -> 20721.85s]  How you guys doing by the way, everybody having a good day. You guys enjoying the stream having a good time
[20722.77s -> 20728.81s]  Watching me go bald in live like live time. You guys are like, oh look Geronimo's going bald live on stream
[20730.93s -> 20732.37s]  It's rough
[20732.37s -> 20769.54s]  Well, I'm gonna take my pants off
[20771.50s -> 20775.45s]  Dude what I
[20775.47s -> 20777.47s]  Fuck you guys
[20777.47s -> 20783.23s]  They fucking like I get double swap. Did you guys see that shit? Oh, yeah, the support could do it and then he banned Senna
[20783.23s -> 20784.59s]  I
[20784.59s -> 20786.59s]  Mean I didn't hover it. So that's my bad
[20787.37s -> 20795.46s]  God damn it. I should have hovered. I was just like taking my pants off and now he wants first pick
[20797.70s -> 20803.99s]  Dude, what? Oh my god. I hate I don't I don't know. I don't know what to say. This is crazy
[20809.03s -> 20811.03s]  Today's thursday, right?
[20811.83s -> 20824.10s]  Am I losing days today's thursday, right guys it is. Okay, cool
[20825.94s -> 20828.58s]  Uh, what do I play they have zarath and zin
[20830.26s -> 20831.54s]  If zaya
[20831.54s -> 20833.54s]  I mean, I guess I could just play recon. It's not a big deal
[20840.93s -> 20845.09s]  Let's see what their bot lane is though. I I actually have to see what their bot lane is to choose my runes
[20848.76s -> 20850.76s]  So no, no
[20851.24s -> 20853.24s]  Oh, they have an israel
[20853.48s -> 20855.48s]  What the fuck is their team comp? Um
[20856.20s -> 20889.23s]  Okay, when you do this build, what's the secondary supposed to be? I think it's supposed to be this or maybe like revitalize. I
[20890.11s -> 20892.23s]  Just like I'm flinching so good. Oh
[20894.80s -> 20896.80s]  They have a support
[20897.12s -> 20900.12s]  Zarath so sports. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so I want I
[20901.08s -> 20903.24s]  Definitely want glacial here and I want
[20905.24s -> 20909.36s]  Maybe I take MR actually instead of armor because they have two poke champs
[20910.12s -> 20912.12s]  And I take this
[20912.12s -> 20920.20s]  Yeah, yeah, this is good. Okay. That's not bad. Okay. One sec. I'll be right back. I need to get some more water
[20987.69s -> 20989.69s]  Oh shit, no, don't flag me
[20990.97s -> 20992.97s]  Fuck man, I had to pee
[20993.73s -> 20995.73s]  Fucking flag me for AFK cuz I didn't take a leak
[20996.41s -> 21002.18s]  Can you not start with AD carry then move over to support? I always fall asleep before the AD carry gameplay
[21003.18s -> 21007.66s]  Wait, what? I'm supposed to see before 80k. What do you mean? Oh
[21008.98s -> 21011.30s]  You mean like start with my main and then play
[21013.86s -> 21015.86s]  Yeah, I played 80 carry at the start I
[21026.21s -> 21028.21s]  Should probably
[21029.45s -> 21031.77s]  Play 80 carry more over support
[21033.77s -> 21035.41s]  Later in the stream
[21035.41s -> 21038.97s]  Here, I'll play an 80 carry game after this. I feel bad. Oh
[21038.97s -> 21059.96s]  Oh, it's Gragas. I thought it was gonna be Xerath, but it's Gragas.
[21063.79s -> 21068.39s]  I don't want to fight too hard level one, even though that guy- I should have gone in there. That was my bad.
[21068.39s -> 21072.91s]  I wanna- I want to try and get level two here, even though I think we actually win level one.
[21075.92s -> 21079.48s]  Ooh, I got his bone plating. Yeah, I should have fought level one. That was my bad.
[21080.52s -> 21083.04s]  Because we win very hard level one. I just griefed it.
[21084.28s -> 21088.64s]  Like all I have to do there is go in on the Ezreal or the Gragas level one, and they can't play the game.
[21088.64s -> 21089.64s]  Right?
[21089.64s -> 21110.48s]  It's not worth it, it's not worth it.
[21110.48s -> 21115.91s]  There's no way that I cannot get E'd by Gragas there, by the way.
[21115.91s -> 21129.62s]  I don't know if I can flash W there.
[21129.62s -> 21131.58s]  Maybe we shouldn't be E'ing, buddy.
[21131.58s -> 21139.82s]  This guy just fucking E'ing in front of me, like what?
[21139.82s -> 21159.19s]  Okay, I might have missed everything there, but like, you know, it's okay.
[21159.39s -> 21173.58s]  It's a little counterproductive
[21175.26s -> 21177.98s]  When I take a tower shot to land a Q
[21179.50s -> 21181.50s]  Feels a little counterproductive
[21188.81s -> 21190.45s]  but hey
[21190.45s -> 21195.94s]  I'm gonna back here just in case
[21196.78s -> 21199.16s]  The enemy Xin tries to gank mid
[21201.77s -> 21203.85s]  Dude, I'm so sad. I can't get boots
[21204.69s -> 21210.67s]  I'm gonna wait
[21210.67s -> 21212.67s]  Yeah, I'm gonna be cringe. I'm gonna wait. I
[21213.19s -> 21217.23s]  Would never wait here normally, but you know what? It's just it's so like it's such a big buy
[21218.15s -> 21220.15s]  I don't want to I'm
[21221.49s -> 21227.47s]  Now that now that I've waited and beat cringe now, I have to sit here and wait. Oh, it's so painful. Okay, I'm on my way
[21228.47s -> 21247.43s]  I'm sorry guys
[21247.43s -> 21254.08s]  Worth the wait. Nah, not at all. I got lucky but
[21254.92s -> 21269.73s]  You know, what's interesting. I never use the stupid dematerializer
[21269.73s -> 21274.61s]  I think I should have like I should use it on every cannon or some shit, but I just don't do it
[21275.17s -> 21278.13s]  Because I know the reason you're supposed to use it is because it helps you push
[21278.77s -> 21281.61s]  Because you can dematerialize the cannon right and just insta. Yeah
[21282.39s -> 21285.75s]  so you're supposed to use it because it's like a really fast way to push but it's also a I
[21302.94s -> 21306.92s]  Should not have w'd fuck. I got well not the gragas anyway. I
[21307.50s -> 21310.04s]  Fucked up. I shouldn't have w'd the gragas. I should have played it slower
[21312.71s -> 21314.71s]  This guy's gonna die. Oh
[21317.31s -> 21319.37s]  He's gonna die he put himself against the wall GG
[21321.63s -> 21323.53s]  That was my fault though
[21323.53s -> 21327.96s]  100%
[21327.96s -> 21332.72s]  Cuz if I didn't W in they can't kill us right and gragas probably dies to the auto attack
[21332.72s -> 21335.54s]  Anyway, my thought process was gragas is snared
[21335.54s -> 21340.94s]  So if I W here, but even after like even if I don't get E'd I'm pretty confident. I'd die
[21377.53s -> 21388.02s]  Damnit I tried I was out of everything. I wonder if I could have played that better
[21388.64s -> 21391.72s]  Maybe like if I could have weaved an extra auto in or something. I
[21392.60s -> 21394.60s]  Don't know
[21394.68s -> 21412.26s]  It's hard to know
[21412.26s -> 21414.26s]  I'm gonna go mid here. I
[21414.26s -> 21422.34s]  I can't okay, well I could go mid, but I think I I think I want to say bot for a bit and get some XP
[21422.34s -> 21450.16s]  I think it's smarter to do that at this point. I think we should push this. I don't want to W in because I know Xin's hair. Yeah
[21451.66s -> 21471.19s]  That's why I didn't want to W because I know Xin's hair. They were just making it so obvious right like that. It was like
[21472.81s -> 21476.81s]  Sometimes when people make shit too good to be true. It is too good to be true
[21476.81s -> 21482.93s]  true like oh shit we're just gonna they're just gonna fight us here cool oh
[21482.93s -> 21516.48s]  yeah I gotta help him push my bad I'm playing sloppy you guys wanna see a cool
[21516.48s -> 21525.85s]  trick watch this she could push the wave and then just min max the back yeah how
[21525.85s -> 21532.70s]  cool was that she just pushes the wave and I just back next to the bush and
[21532.70s -> 21549.51s]  she's just like oh I guess I'll take the free ride I really need level six
[21549.51s -> 21565.90s]  Badly like bro. I really cannot get level six right now. This is
[21567.36s -> 21573.27s]  painful
[21573.27s -> 21576.23s]  Hey kill these maybe I'm six off this. Nope. Guess not. I
[21577.19s -> 21580.57s]  Was gonna stay mid there by the way and help the homie. I
[21581.67s -> 21583.51s]  Need to go mid
[21583.51s -> 21614.41s]  This is so awkward
[21627.81s -> 21635.66s]  Bro, help me
[21635.66s -> 21643.10s]  Bro, like you got to walk to me. Like I can't like my Eve is like here. I'm way over here
[21644.38s -> 21647.02s]  Right in my eaves like yo homie
[21647.66s -> 21655.91s]  Like dude, I'm sure like we're trying to push the wave in for her and she's just not accepting to wait
[21656.71s -> 21660.73s]  And I can't W the wall
[21660.73s -> 21664.19s]  I mean, I guess I could W the wall because I was trying to walk around right?
[21664.19s -> 21668.63s]  I saw her in trouble when I was here. So I wanted her to walk towards here so I could e over the wall
[21669.43s -> 21672.31s]  That was my thought process e over the wall help the guy
[21672.63s -> 21676.83s]  But he like didn't understand that and I just got shit on and it felt really bad
[21682.09s -> 21686.59s]  Both our solos are getting absolutely shit on.
[21686.59s -> 21687.71s]  This is very bad.
[21688.67s -> 21695.30s]  Cause I don't know how to help our team at this stage.
[21695.30s -> 21697.94s]  Like I'm just always behind on tempo now around the map
[21697.94s -> 21722.12s]  in the wrong spot at the wrong time.
[21722.12s -> 21723.20s]  This is so awkward.
[21726.18s -> 21732.34s]  I have ult, we could kill this guy.
[21732.34s -> 21733.18s]  I guess not.
[21736.30s -> 21755.87s]  We could maybe kill the Zen if I sneak in here.
[21755.87s -> 21757.63s]  Push the wave, push the wave, hurry.
[21758.71s -> 21775.86s]  He's got to crash it.
[21775.86s -> 21781.08s]  I mean, this guy's just dead.
[21781.08s -> 21783.12s]  My AD carry is gonna get fucked for it though,
[21783.12s -> 21784.36s]  so I hope it was worth.
[21785.28s -> 21793.74s]  Like my AD carry is gonna get zoned.
[21793.74s -> 21796.02s]  It's really hard to tell if anything like that's worth
[21796.02s -> 21800.44s]  sometimes because I used my ult before a dragon fight.
[21800.44s -> 21801.58s]  We're gonna lose bot tower.
[21801.58s -> 21802.90s]  There's just so many factors, right?
[21802.90s -> 21804.42s]  It's so hard.
[21804.42s -> 21805.62s]  And now I don't have wards.
[21805.62s -> 21806.70s]  Oh, it's so rough.
[21826.06s -> 21826.94s]  I got the ignite off,
[21826.94s -> 21829.42s]  but dude, I can't believe that Gragas lived.
[21829.42s -> 21830.26s]  No.
[21830.26s -> 21832.24s]  Oh, I had stopwatch.
[21832.24s -> 21839.36s]  have stopwatch oh my god i'm the worst player in existence i actually have the ability to live
[21839.36s -> 21854.07s]  there oh no i should sell my magi is in shame i actually just want the item so dude i'm so bad
[21855.59s -> 21859.75s]  dude gragas is low key a good pick versus rakan though you can stop his engage so easily
[21859.75s -> 21896.95s]  It's actually low-key a good pick bro
[21921.85s -> 21941.76s]  Nice not bad. I kind of want to back off here. You know what feels kind of bad. He has noticed that I just I got my
[21943.28s -> 21952.43s]  I don't if you guys notice this but I got my fucking I got like four assists just now, but it was after I
[21953.09s -> 21956.85s]  Sold my medjazz. How fucking bad does that feel?
[21958.01s -> 21959.23s]  like
[21959.23s -> 21964.06s]  actually, oh
[21964.06s -> 21966.42s]  By the way, uh, I wanted to ask you guys
[21968.46s -> 21970.98s]  What ad carry do you guys think is the most
[21971.78s -> 21973.78s]  Sought out for people to learn right now
[21976.51s -> 21981.55s]  Like what would you say? It's like people want to learn this ad carry over other ad carries
[21982.15s -> 21984.15s]  What are you guys thinking?
[21984.35s -> 21986.35s]  My man says Teemo. Okay
[21986.55s -> 21988.47s]  Makes sense
[21988.47s -> 21997.62s]  Got it
[21997.62s -> 22000.38s]  Depends. Yeah. I'm just trying to wonder like what um
[22000.38s -> 22002.38s]  I'm just bad.
[22002.38s -> 22004.38s]  He's bad too.
[22004.38s -> 22006.38s]  Listen, we're bad.
[22006.38s -> 22008.38s]  We're bad guys.
[22008.38s -> 22010.38s]  Not bad.
[22010.38s -> 22016.58s]  Jin Lucian, Xayah, Felios.
[22016.58s -> 22018.58s]  Damn, is it like just that different?
[22018.58s -> 22020.58s]  Like a lot of people like different stuff?
[22020.58s -> 22024.78s]  Because I've always just thought like
[22024.78s -> 22070.27s]  Oh no.
[22070.27s -> 22073.97s]  I'm just bad.
[22073.97s -> 22075.97s]  I'm just bad.
[22075.97s -> 22077.97s]  I'm just bad.
[22077.97s -> 22081.28s]  I'm just bad.
[22081.28s -> 22092.70s]  Oh, no, I guess I've always just thought that people like a
[22095.77s -> 22099.49s]  Lot of people really like like meta ad carries are like really play makey ad carries
[22099.49s -> 22102.49s]  Right like Jinx is probably the best ad carry in the meta
[22102.73s -> 22106.71s]  But I don't see a lot of people ever ask or like request to watch Jinx
[22107.21s -> 22108.01s]  You know what I mean?
[22108.01s -> 22111.61s]  Like Jinx is not like she's not like a fun ad carry that people want to learn how to play
[22111.81s -> 22115.83s]  Even though she is like the best ad there's like the people who are like, oh, yeah
[22115.83s -> 22118.17s]  No jinx is boring. I got want to play Jin and like shoot people
[22118.17s -> 22121.95s]  I want to play like Lucian and bash around like it's like so that's what I'm wondering is like what the number one
[22121.95s -> 22124.37s]  At 80 carry is for like people just like enjoy watching
[22125.07s -> 22141.40s]  Not bad, though
[22141.40s -> 22148.72s]  Okay, I think we could play an 80 carry game. I'm done. I owe you guys an 80 carry game
[22148.72s -> 22154.18s]  I owe you that much for watching me play support for two hours. Actually, I think it was like two and a half hours
[22157.07s -> 22159.25s]  Yeah, we played four games of support. So it's like two hours
[22160.63s -> 22162.87s]  Yeah, I owe you guys for for that
[22162.87s -> 22174.82s]  Zyah or Vayne? Zyah is fun to watch. I do like Zyah. You love Jinx and Cait? Oh, there you go.
[22181.59s -> 22184.31s]  You're playing support top so you like to watch how ad carries play? Ah.
[22186.55s -> 22203.78s]  So that you can like better help the homies. Got it. Got it. We need eight wins I think from
[22203.78s -> 22209.30s]  this point. We are right now. I think it's eight wins to get to Grandmaster. I think.
[22209.30s -> 22221.26s]  oops because we're what 370 something right like three set 360 no we just won we're not 360 we're
[22221.26s -> 22234.47s]  like 370 we're 387 okay so it's not updated but what is this stop so we need what seven wins
[22235.11s -> 22241.91s]  net wins to get to gm i think we can hit gm i'm i'm a little less confident right now about
[22241.91s -> 22245.01s]  Master or about Challenger, but I think we can definitely hit gym
[22246.11s -> 22248.39s]  Like I think I'll get stuck in gym for a bit
[22249.35s -> 22253.64s]  unless
[22253.64s -> 22255.64s]  unless
[22255.96s -> 22259.50s]  The games get higher quality. I'll be stuck in gym for a little bit
[22264.74s -> 22268.06s]  because the thing about the thing about the games so far is like
[22268.50s -> 22273.94s]  The higher quality the games get the easier it actually is to carry if like if you're a decent player
[22274.42s -> 22278.82s]  because the better your teammates get which means that like if you're at that like say like
[22279.14s -> 22282.50s]  Challenger player will have a better time a challenger ad carry player carrying in
[22282.80s -> 22290.12s]  Challenger if they get a lead then in diamond if they get a lead if if that like I know that sounds weird to say
[22290.12s -> 22294.28s]  but that's it's it's basically just because like when your teammates are better they enable you better and
[22294.80s -> 22298.78s]  80 carry and all those other roles when they're being enabled. It's a lot easier to play the game
[22299.20s -> 22308.36s]  Like if I were to first pick jinx in challenger MMR
[22308.72s -> 22313.32s]  There's a good chance my teammates would pick stuff that like lets me play jinx, right?
[22313.32s -> 22317.04s]  I'm not saying it would happen, but there's like a chance that my teammates would pick something that like
[22317.56s -> 22320.36s]  They would pick like tanks or frontliners or some shit, right?
[22320.52s -> 22326.58s]  Or like Lulu whereas like if you pickin if you're picking Jinx first pickin like let's say you guys are gold average
[22326.84s -> 22331.08s]  Well, your support might just literally pick like first-time Vel'Koz or some shit and you're like, well this sucks
[22331.68s -> 22345.93s]  Dude, I swear every time I hear the end of this song
[22346.61s -> 22348.93s]  Does anybody know who forest within is?
[22348.93s -> 22350.61s]  I
[22350.61s -> 22355.53s]  Swear the guy talking at the end of this song sounds exactly like forest within
[22357.01s -> 22359.01s]  No joke listen to this listen to this
[22359.29s -> 22369.23s]  That that guy who was like saying it was DJ
[22369.23s -> 22376.03s]  What like that guy sounded exactly like I don't know why my brain does that homie sounded exactly like forest within I swear to God
[22376.31s -> 22381.33s]  It's actually like perfectly like if you told me that was him. I would immediately believe you
[22381.75s -> 22392.19s]  This guy wants to join the discord. Oh, I'm nervous about this shit
[22392.27s -> 22436.76s]  Zodiac147 It is my support though. So like maybe we could join the discord and like work together a bit. But I'm also nervous about joining discord calls with people on stream. I don't know. I don't know if it's worth where would you put Ezreal on the tier list? I think Ezreal's A tier. I think he could be S tier for solo queue. But he's hard. He's really hard. Ezreal is one of the hardest ADs. So I would say he's like A tier right now.
[22436.80s -> 22438.80s]  If you're really good at is
[22438.92s -> 22441.28s]  He is very very very strong
[22442.08s -> 22444.24s]  But he's also incredibly hard to play
[22445.92s -> 22450.76s]  But he also is not weak in the meta so I'd give him like strong a
[22452.56s -> 22454.56s]  Like above other A's
[22456.36s -> 22460.04s]  She focused on made supports like brand Zareth or engage like blitz and otterless
[22460.40s -> 22463.04s]  It depends on your you know, and it depends on what you're doing. I
[22463.04s -> 22469.68s]  I think engage supports in lower elo are bad.
[22469.68s -> 22474.40s]  Oh, somebody dodged.
[22474.40s -> 22482.35s]  I think engage supports in lower elo are bad personally because I think that you can
[22482.35s -> 22487.27s]  be a really good engage player and it doesn't matter if your team just gets caught over
[22487.27s -> 22491.33s]  and over again or if you like make it engage and your team misplays, right?
[22491.33s -> 22496.49s]  So it's like, if you want to play engage supports, do it because they are better
[22496.49s -> 22497.49s]  than other.
[22497.49s -> 22502.77s]  Engaged supports are better than mages, but I think in solo queue, mages are better to solo carry.
[22503.49s -> 22506.85s]  So it just depends. It depends on your elo and it depends on what you're trying to accomplish,
[22506.85s -> 22512.13s]  right? Because a lot of the time as a support player, it's why I play Senna, right? I play
[22512.13s -> 22519.73s]  Senna because I like being able to carry games as support. That's why I like Senna. Whereas
[22519.73s -> 22526.69s]  if you're a... I can play almost every support, right? I can play Nautilus, I can play
[22526.69s -> 22531.73s]  these supports. But the problem is, is like I feel bad if like I get like it feels really shitty to
[22531.73s -> 22535.01s]  get people ahead and then have them completely throw their leads over and over again and then
[22535.01s -> 22539.73s]  tilt and range and shit. So it feels like dog shits. So it's nicer to just like give myself
[22539.73s -> 22547.84s]  the opportunity to carry rather than rely 100% on other people, you know? But I would say the
[22547.84s -> 22553.84s]  number one thing is play what you think is fun. That's just the number one rule like
[22553.84s -> 22559.12s]  playing if you want to win you can play meta but the problem is if like you're showing your face
[22559.12s -> 22562.64s]  and not trying to learn a meta champ that you just don't enjoy the playstyle of you're never
[22562.64s -> 22566.72s]  going to actually be good at the at the champion because you're you're like it's like you're working
[22566.72s -> 22571.68s]  right but the best way to learn the champions and learn how to play the game is to have fun
[22571.68s -> 22574.96s]  because if you're not having fun at some point you're not going to be able to learn
[22574.96s -> 22578.72s]  how to play because you're not going to be able to put in the hours or put in the games
[22578.72s -> 22582.08s]  and like be focused during the game you're going to be frustrated and if you're frustrated
[22582.08s -> 22611.78s]  I'm surprised, can you guys even hear the music half the time?
[22611.78s -> 22614.94s]  I have it on so low that I'm not even sure you guys can hear it.
[22614.94s -> 22617.78s]  It's just like barely background noise.
[22617.78s -> 22644.54s]  Is this guy holding swap hostage?
[22644.54s -> 22647.42s]  Join call and I'll swap.
[22647.42s -> 22666.92s]  Dude he's holding swap hostage.
[22666.92s -> 22669.94s]  By the way, if you guys do like the stream, don't forget to follow.
[22669.94s -> 22672.62s]  You can scroll down to see all my socials too.
[22672.62s -> 22676.08s]  Like TikTok, Instagram, all that crap.
[22676.08s -> 22686.98s]  It's all below the stream, there's like links and shit.
[22686.98s -> 22687.98s]  And uh, you know.
[22687.98s -> 22692.06s]  A man's gotta eat, you can use your Twitch Prime too if you want, you know, if you're
[22692.06s -> 22704.74s]  feeling it.
[22704.74s -> 22708.00s]  I'm gonna do a Kaisa game.
[22708.00s -> 22712.76s]  He went Lux, but I kinda wanna play Kaisa.
[22712.76s -> 22717.29s]  What was the voice?
[22717.29s -> 22720.21s]  This is what happens when I get close to the mic.
[22720.21s -> 22722.21s]  I
[22722.49s -> 22725.85s]  Should put the mic in front of my face more the mics like over to the corner
[22726.01s -> 22728.21s]  So the mic is like really badly directions
[22752.66s -> 22754.66s]  This is a cut down game just
[22757.21s -> 22760.77s]  Gragas always use AP. He doesn't go tank. He goes like AP. I
[22761.81s -> 22781.22s]  Kind of want to go last stands. That's fine. I should think ghost
[22782.08s -> 22791.95s]  Go still to win. So good this game. You tried Kate with shield bow. It's strong. Yeah, it's fun, huh?
[22791.95s -> 22795.56s]  I love Kate with shield, but it's so fun
[22796.40s -> 22798.40s]  This would have been such a good ghost game
[22799.48s -> 22801.48s]  I'm frustrated. Oh well.
[22802.98s -> 22817.14s]  I like wasn't paying attention. I I always wonder if I should go
[22818.04s -> 22820.04s]  part of me always wants to go like
[22821.40s -> 22825.40s]  Long sword 3 against Thresh and Xayah, but with Kaisa
[22825.40s -> 22829.94s]  I feel like you're on really specific timers with Kaisa. So you have to go like
[22830.64s -> 22832.64s]  It's really important to go
[22832.64s -> 22838.40s]  Doran so that you can get the Q upgrade timer on the right, you know, like on the right timing I
[22839.60s -> 22841.84s]  Think getting the Q upgrade timer is just so big
[22843.16s -> 22846.58s]  Also this game. I feel like I go Bork this game
[22847.24s -> 22849.24s]  seconds Bork or what sends
[22849.92s -> 22855.20s]  If Gragas is not ultra fed. I'll probably go Bork because I don't want to get what's in just for Gragas
[22855.80s -> 22874.95s]  Okay, you started Q. Oh
[22875.19s -> 22877.19s]  Diana's starting on wolves
[22877.79s -> 22907.90s]  Okay, I need to get some coffee after this game. We're getting drowsy. I should have done the middle minion thing. I'm so bad
[22909.42s -> 22911.72s]  Like I should have legitimately just done the thing with the minion
[22912.14s -> 22921.50s]  So when you know thresh starts hook you can still play up right? I can play up I can play aggressive
[22922.06s -> 22941.69s]  I'm bad. I
[22942.03s -> 22944.03s]  Should have just killed the thresh
[22945.05s -> 22947.61s]  This is really bad, man. We can't help we can't help
[22947.61s -> 22953.48s]  Because the wave the way the wave is going. Oh, I'm so bad. I fucked up
[22953.96s -> 22960.31s]  It should be fine. But I still like it were it it fucks us over early game
[22962.46s -> 22964.66s]  Cuz they fucked up very badly
[22965.94s -> 22969.58s]  Like I can't stress enough how badly they just fucked up, but it didn't matter
[22971.26s -> 22974.30s]  Okay, that's that's happening apparently
[22975.54s -> 22978.34s]  Don't worry guys. I'm the best Zaya player or Kai'sa player on the server
[22979.02s -> 22991.06s]  It's me. God. I am just literally playing like dog shits
[22991.18s -> 23016.65s]  I picked Kaisa. I just felt like playing her. We got it back. We have to leave the wave in a bad spot
[23017.57s -> 23031.24s]  Maybe she can push it but like Wukong's here. So yeah, we just okay. We got it. Nice. Not bad
[23032.24s -> 23035.52s]  So we had to push the wave in there so that the wave will bounce back
[23035.80s -> 23038.00s]  But we had to do it on it. It was a really bad timer
[23038.40s -> 23042.48s]  Let me just say I fucked up the entire early game of this game like this games. I'm so bad
[23043.72s -> 23048.42s]  Essentially what should have happened was level one when they walked up when Kaisa and Thresh walked up level one
[23048.42s -> 23050.98s]  We should have killed them like I should have just straight up
[23051.38s -> 23056.82s]  Hit the thresh with the Lux because thresh walked into our wave because Wukong was level 2 ganking
[23056.94s -> 23060.94s]  Should have just killed him. I grieved that and because I went for the Xayah instead
[23060.94s -> 23063.98s]  I put myself in a spot where I took like 80% of my HP for free
[23064.44s -> 23068.42s]  Right which put me behind and now the entire fight was like harder
[23068.62s -> 23072.72s]  Because I was low and then we had to wait for the wait. It was just it was really bad
[23074.30s -> 23075.42s]  Really
[23075.42s -> 23085.99s]  That minion actually just did that. I don't think we can kill this guy unless she can max range land a Q or something
[23085.99s -> 23095.92s]  But yeah, is there the best ad right now? No, I think Jinx is better. I
[23096.52s -> 23098.08s]  Think Zarya is good
[23098.08s -> 23101.40s]  Her late game, especially with like paired with an enchanter Zarya is insane
[23102.08s -> 23104.76s]  But I think Jinx is better for solo Q
[23106.88s -> 23108.88s]  I actually have to flash
[23113.46s -> 23116.26s]  That was a good play hook by that guy. I disrespected him
[23116.26s -> 23127.58s]  I might have to leave because Wukong can just go here and dive me. I actually just have to leave this feels so bad
[23128.26s -> 23130.26s]  You see how Wukong just used the plants
[23131.86s -> 23137.46s]  If I stay I can just die right so I'm just misplaying all over the place I'm taking too much damage
[23137.46s -> 23139.46s]  We're playing weak side right now, right?
[23139.66s -> 23143.64s]  What I mean by that is like we know our Diana's top and we know they're Wukong's bot
[23143.90s -> 23147.28s]  So because of that I need to play a lot less tradie
[23147.28s -> 23150.92s]  Like I walked up and just let the Thresh flame me for free and I missed two waves now
[23150.92s -> 23156.40s]  I need to not do that because if I don't miss these waves it doesn't matter for weak sighting because I'm not behind so it's
[23156.92s -> 23158.72s]  It's just really stupid
[23158.72s -> 23166.86s]  Now what I do want to do is I want to go check and see if the Wukong's like on our camps or something
[23166.94s -> 23177.36s]  Or if he's doing dragon or some shits. I should not have used the blast cone. Dude. I am so bad. I
[23178.36s -> 23184.00s]  Used the blast cone to just hit it. It's playing support man. It makes your it makes your brain smaller
[23184.00s -> 23186.00s]  Actually
[23186.52s -> 23234.02s]  Like I swear playing support makes my brain smaller. Oh, they're in dragon the Zayas trolling. I
[23235.46s -> 23240.29s]  Think pretty sure I just freeze this no with the Lux
[23240.89s -> 23251.68s]  Yeah, she's just trolling. I don't know what the fuck that was. I took a little bit of damage, but
[23253.24s -> 23275.91s]  She has to overextend now
[23275.91s -> 23277.77s]  Not bad. Okay, so
[23277.77s -> 23282.85s]  Does I wanted to back the reason that I froze that was because I wants the back but she can't back until we push
[23282.85s -> 23284.01s]  the wave in
[23284.01s -> 23289.45s]  Or till they push the wave in right so it gives me time to kind of catch up on my back timer with the Ziya
[23290.25s -> 23292.37s]  Because I'm you know a little bit behind and farm
[23301.49s -> 23303.49s]  Thresh is definitely gonna go mid here
[23304.13s -> 23307.17s]  He's either gonna go mid or he's gonna try and hook us from the bush. I
[23308.85s -> 23313.01s]  Think I'm gonna shoot my W through all of the bushes here. Okay, Thresh isn't in the bushes
[23314.75s -> 23316.75s]  He's just Mia yeah, we don't know where he is
[23317.35s -> 23319.39s]  This is awkward because I can't really walk up
[23319.39s -> 23323.77s]  I mean, I guess I'm almost sick. So I guess I could walk up
[23325.37s -> 23333.90s]  Yeah, there he is, okay, we see him he is level five so it's
[23334.78s -> 23346.86s]  We could probably actually fight like if this guy lands a binding. I might be able to just trade. I just I am dead
[23346.86s -> 23357.89s]  I suck. Honestly, I I needed to my bad. I'm playing bad. That's on me
[23359.31s -> 23361.45s]  The locks just playing so good. I needed the
[23362.71s -> 23366.17s]  W but then back up after the bind. I've just I'm mechanically
[23366.17s -> 23369.17s]  I'm totally shitting on myself right now, like out of my mouth.
[23369.17s -> 23372.89s]  Just shit.
[23372.89s -> 23375.93s]  Because I knew exactly what was going to happen when I used W in front of the fucking
[23375.93s -> 23376.93s]  Thresh's face.
[23376.93s -> 23378.37s]  I was like, here we go.
[23378.37s -> 23380.37s]  You know what I mean?
[23380.37s -> 23384.45s]  Technically we're both six and he's five, but it doesn't matter because if I get hooked,
[23384.45s -> 23385.45s]  I don't have enough damage.
[23385.45s -> 23397.51s]  So now here, I'm going to walk up and see if I can stop the Xayah's back maybe.
[23397.51s -> 23401.29s]  Or maybe she's backing in a weird spot.
[23401.29s -> 23402.93s]  Yeah, we stopped their backs.
[23402.93s -> 23403.93s]  Huge.
[23403.93s -> 23411.49s]  they're in trouble so they really needed the back on that timer because
[23411.49s -> 23415.13s]  they just want to fight right and because they just want to fight they want
[23415.13s -> 23425.50s]  to go back right no way dude fuck off I cannot dodge a hook right now to save
[23425.50s -> 23434.59s]  my fucking life Jesus Christ what is my movements men like tilting myself
[23434.59s -> 23448.51s]  I want to stay for this wave, but mid is mia. Yeah, I can't
[23450.37s -> 23454.77s]  It feels so bad because I needed one more wave to get double pickaxe
[23455.53s -> 23457.33s]  So I can get my upgrade
[23457.33s -> 23461.29s]  Cuz like normally you go noon quiver pickaxe pickaxe if you go noon pick pick
[23461.73s -> 23465.25s]  It gives you enough ad to get your Q upgrade, right? And that's like the whole point
[23465.25s -> 23468.45s]  You don't need Kraken. You just need your Q upgrade because your Q upgrades when you start bursting
[23469.29s -> 23474.09s]  But because I got hooked under the turrets, even though we got a kill I had to back and I couldn't get my timer
[23474.57s -> 23488.52s]  I'm so trash. I need some coffee. That's what it is, man. I swear to God
[23489.44s -> 23491.44s]  Coffee's my savior. It'll save me
[23520.44s -> 23523.06s]  That wave actually just did that to me holy shit
[23524.36s -> 23526.60s]  We don't actually have to do anything here crazy
[23527.44s -> 23547.61s]  Nice well played. Nice
[23558.29s -> 23560.29s]  Nice nice nice
[23560.95s -> 23574.26s]  That was a good 2v2. All right, I got my Q upgrade now we're chillin. Oh now we're hella chillin. Oh
[23575.66s -> 23577.38s]  Yeah, baby
[23577.38s -> 23583.51s]  You know what it is. It's like a
[23584.39s -> 23594.48s]  I'm playing the fights too quick. I just got to slow down and I think I'm like too hyped up. I
[23606.19s -> 23609.07s]  Really don't want to miss this wave. There's a person right there. Oh
[23610.63s -> 23612.63s]  Shit, let's go
[23612.75s -> 23615.91s]  Yeah, he's dead. Okay, I'm gonna go farm bot while that guy gets that
[23616.67s -> 23622.41s]  This Lux is really good. I
[23632.16s -> 23634.16s]  Kind of want to oh I can't get this plate fuck
[23636.34s -> 23637.68s]  What?
[23637.68s -> 23639.16s]  What?
[23639.16s -> 23641.16s]  That was BS
[23645.18s -> 23649.58s]  Okay, you know what? I'll just take my entire HP bar really quick on the turret. It's not a big deal guys
[23650.94s -> 23654.26s]  I'm just I'm that good at the game. Like I don't mean to brag but like, you know
[23654.98s -> 23656.98s]  Professional gamer over here like, you know
[23657.62s -> 23661.12s]  Gonna be one some lessons. Like I got you
[23661.96s -> 23672.64s]  Dude, look how big my shield is
[23673.52s -> 23688.48s]  wait
[23688.70s -> 23690.70s]  You son of a bitch I
[23691.76s -> 23708.67s]  Mean she's dead but I got out playing man
[23713.31s -> 23728.02s]  Motherfucker all right, they forfeit it nice
[23729.96s -> 23731.24s]  Well
[23731.24s -> 23736.21s]  Well, I need to make some coffee. I'm playing that give me a sec
[23737.15s -> 23739.15s]  We're playing real bad. I need some coffee
[23753.39s -> 23757.49s]  Nice though. We hit 400 LP. Let's go. So now we just need 150 more
[23757.49s -> 23775.13s]  We need 550. I think 550 is GM. I didn't do anything that game by the way. I did nothing I
[23776.53s -> 23778.53s]  Could play another 80 carry game. That was fun
[23779.33s -> 23781.33s]  I'm gonna grab some coffee. I'll be right back
[23782.81s -> 23785.77s]  Talks amongst yourselves boys. I believe in you
[23786.85s -> 23790.41s]  You can look at my 80 carry tier list that we've been trying to figure out how to do
[23791.25s -> 23793.99s]  Enjoy, I'll be we grab some coffee. Oh
[23793.99s -> 23901.94s]  oh fucking a all right i'm back let's go what the fuck
[23903.86s -> 23922.21s]  sweet be back boys we back time is it five oh i probably play for like another hour
[23923.33s -> 23929.81s]  and then i gotta get off and make some dinner do some other shit you know what i'm saying
[23929.81s -> 23943.52s]  Where were we? Oh, yeah, we're making the tier list. Yeah, I think Varus is really good a I
[23944.72s -> 23946.72s]  think versus good eight here cuz um
[23947.92s -> 23949.32s]  In my opinion
[23949.32s -> 23953.06s]  Varus is never really like a bad pick almost like sometimes he's bad
[23953.06s -> 23957.88s]  But I think he's just you can play him on hit or you can play him without II, right?
[23957.88s -> 23962.88s]  So he's got two builds that you can do based on the game and the team comp his ulti is pretty much always useful
[23963.56s -> 23967.52s]  Like just having a stun like a root on a champion is always gonna be useful
[23967.52s -> 23972.98s]  Then you have he's got very long range like engage you can safely kill people with his ult in his Q
[23973.52s -> 23977.32s]  You can build him poke or like before objectives. You can make picks really easily
[23977.32s -> 23979.32s]  You can poke people out before the objective get him low
[23979.84s -> 23984.62s]  His lane phase is really good. If you're if you understand like how to play Varus his lane phase is exceptional
[23984.82s -> 23986.82s]  he also has
[23987.74s -> 23990.82s]  In the meta currently I feel like he's just like a good pick
[23990.82s -> 23995.34s]  I don't think he's as good as Draven and Jinx for solo Q, but I do think he's really good
[23996.06s -> 23998.64s]  In general, you can you can climb with them really easily
[23999.66s -> 24002.10s]  And then I put ash here, too
[24002.90s -> 24005.32s]  Maybe ash. I don't know who I'd put in front
[24006.38s -> 24011.92s]  Ash or various I think maybe ash or maybe various. I think ash is really underrated though
[24011.92s -> 24027.06s]  I think ash is super super good right now. I think ash is super good
[24027.94s -> 24029.46s]  because
[24029.46s -> 24031.46s]  Sorry, I'm trying to think
[24032.34s -> 24036.04s]  She's basically the same idea as various she's a little different, but she's the same idea
[24038.26s -> 24042.56s]  She controls lane phase pretty well, her lane isn't too bad. She also has
[24044.58s -> 24048.78s]  Like her R, always useful no matter what. So like you'll always have use with Ashe,
[24048.78s -> 24053.20s]  you'll always have use with Varus R, like they just stuns, snares, etc. And so look here
[24053.84s -> 24056.10s]  She's also really good at being annoying in team fights
[24056.10s -> 24058.24s]  like you can take Ghost on Ashe and you can just
[24058.42s -> 24064.30s]  Volley, sit outside their range and if you just be basically solo people and she actually has decent scaling on her crit now
[24064.30s -> 24068.08s]  So you can go a bunch of builds to like I think you can go Bork Ash
[24068.08s -> 24073.74s]  You can go crack and slayer ash into Bork or you could go crack and slayer into IE or you can go crack and slayer
[24073.74s -> 24075.50s]  and like
[24075.50s -> 24079.50s]  Whatever you can go shield bow ash if they have tanks you can go gale force that oh you can just do a lot
[24079.50s -> 24081.50s]  Of different builds on ash and I think she's really versatile
[24081.54s -> 24086.68s]  You could also just go the on head build if you really want I I think the rageblade build sucks personally
[24086.68s -> 24090.62s]  I think that if I was gonna go on hit I would just be like shield bow wits ends into like
[24090.62s -> 24096.30s]  Bork or some shit if I was actually gonna do that or she'll go Bork or Borkwitz or whatever, but
[24097.18s -> 24103.71s]  Yeah, I don't know Ezra was probably a tier two. I
[24105.07s -> 24107.23s]  Said Ezra was really gated by like skill
[24107.83s -> 24112.03s]  So I don't want to put him in I think if you could play Ezreal perfectly
[24112.03s -> 24114.03s]  He'd be at the top of ass like he would just be
[24114.11s -> 24117.23s]  Above Jinx just best champion of the game
[24117.23s -> 24122.11s]  If you could if you could never miss a skillshot like a hundred percent accuracy playing perfect like the champs insane, right?
[24122.11s -> 24127.83s]  It's absolutely crazy how good that champ is if you can play him perfect, but you're like people are humans, etc
[24127.99s -> 24132.71s]  So I think he's like an a tier pick in solo queue because you can get countered like he's not blindable
[24132.71s -> 24134.71s]  You can get countered pretty easily by good players
[24135.15s -> 24139.19s]  People play like push comps people play dive comps like early game
[24139.19s -> 24142.67s]  I mean in lane and shits like because Ezreal's lane is like not it's not bad
[24142.87s -> 24146.39s]  But it's very difficult to play Ezreal well in lane phase
[24146.39s -> 24151.83s]  You got to be good mechanically and I don't think even like I've seen like challenger players who can't play Ezreal
[24151.83s -> 24196.38s]  so he's not easy. You know what I'm saying? What's up boys? Sup? I was gonna ban Kindred
[24196.38s -> 24207.34s]  but I couldn't find her. I hate Kindred. Yo how we doing tonight? How's everybody's day?
[24226.76s -> 24249.32s]  Okay so this guy's picking Thresh again. Thresh into Rekhan. Thresh is actually pretty good
[24249.32s -> 24287.66s]  into Rekhan. They have Xayah, Thresh again. Let's play Jinx. I like Jinx here. Even though
[24287.66s -> 24291.64s]  Even though it is against Thresh, Jinx is a little scary, but I kinda like her in this
[24291.64s -> 24299.20s]  situation.
[24299.20s -> 24300.20s]  Let's see what runs.
[24300.20s -> 24301.20s]  Do I want free boots?
[24301.20s -> 24307.69s]  Nah, I think I want to be able to get early boots this game.
[24307.69s -> 24312.61s]  Cause their team comp is like, oh yeah, their team comp is really, really annoying.
[24312.61s -> 24317.77s]  So I kinda wanna get early boots.
[24317.77s -> 24321.97s]  I'll probably go presence of mind.
[24321.97s -> 24323.43s]  Although I think overheal isn't bad.
[24323.43s -> 24329.04s]  Actually, I'll go over hill
[24329.62s -> 24333.44s]  So yeah, these runes look good. Actually, let's do this
[24335.04s -> 24336.84s]  Right this
[24336.84s -> 24347.37s]  This yeah, this is good. Okay. I kind of like these this is good. I'm gonna use these. Okay
[24347.89s -> 24349.89s]  I'm taking claims this game because
[24350.33s -> 24354.57s]  They have Lissandra and Pantheon and Thresh right? So with Lissandra Pantheon and Thresh
[24354.57s -> 24364.57s]  The game's gonna be like really fast of like, okay if they stun me I'm just gonna get CC chained and I'm just gonna die like after a bit right?
[24364.57s -> 24372.68s]  It's gonna be like a stun and they're stun and they're stun and I'm just gonna die. So I'm like nah fuck that shit.
[24372.68s -> 24412.47s]  Let's see if we can get this W boys. Let's see if I can not fuck up the first three levels of the lane.
[24412.47s -> 24419.83s]  Got chat restricted? Oh yeah. It's for a while.
[24419.83s -> 24448.63s]  It's Riot's secret code to make it so I can actually play the game and climb without chatting. Okay. I
[24449.33s -> 24451.33s]  Should have warded this bush. I
[24453.47s -> 24457.33s]  Was drinking my coffee I didn't think about it, but yeah if you guys are against the hook champ
[24458.21s -> 24459.97s]  always ward this bush
[24459.97s -> 24464.95s]  Right like right here. You're gonna want to
[24465.83s -> 24467.99s]  Ward here early against most hook champions
[24469.11s -> 24471.39s]  Because it gives you a very nice
[24471.39s -> 24478.35s]  Like they can't walk in here and cheese you they can't walk in here and cheese you so you just don't get cheesed by anything
[24478.35s -> 24511.32s]  I mean, that's just I don't even know what I just saw
[24512.68s -> 24515.26s]  I'll be real. I don't know what the fuck just happened, but okay
[24516.48s -> 24518.48s]  Trying to push this wave as fast as I can
[24519.28s -> 24534.12s]  Not sure I can actually get it pushed fast enough, but we're gonna try it was close
[24534.76s -> 24542.80s]  No, I'm gonna let it just push. It's not a huge deal
[24543.68s -> 24545.68s]  It was very close though
[24545.88s -> 24553.38s]  We can just break the freeze right like it's not a huge deal. Are they supposed to win level one?
[24554.02s -> 24557.94s]  It depends. I mean Ziya is not that good level one like
[24558.38s -> 24560.90s]  She's I it's good because she has her feathers, right?
[24560.90s -> 24564.42s]  but if you can't stack your feathers of a one jinx has more damage and
[24564.86s -> 24567.30s]  They stacked up for my gap or for my rocket
[24567.30s -> 24573.66s]  So I got like I full stacked my lethal tempo and I just double AOE rocketed them over and over and over and over
[24573.66s -> 24577.36s]  again, right and so
[24577.70s -> 24580.70s]  When they finally all end they were just behind an HP
[24581.98s -> 24584.32s]  Also Thresh missed he only had Flay
[24610.55s -> 24612.97s]  Damn that was so close man
[24613.87s -> 24634.08s]  Like actually if Thresh had died there or not Thresh if Graves had died there we just win the game
[24648.63s -> 24650.99s]  Yeah, this isn't good. Oh, I'm gonna get Flay. I'm dead
[24652.29s -> 24655.19s]  Maybe oh, maybe I'm not dead. I have to walk up like this
[24656.93s -> 24660.37s]  It was a really bad fight by the what what am I watching what the fuck
[24661.15s -> 24668.71s]  That was a bad fight because we knew Graves was bot and we knew that he was going to heal
[24668.71s -> 24670.59s]  in the jungle, right?
[24670.59s -> 24674.93s]  So like my jungler already got outplayed by Graves once top side.
[24674.93s -> 24677.53s]  You shouldn't ever take another fight like that bot side.
[24677.53s -> 24679.33s]  You should just take the win, right?
[24679.33s -> 24680.33s]  Like I rotated.
[24680.33s -> 24685.15s]  Now, granted, the Rakan should have been there to help kill the Graves.
[24685.15s -> 24688.87s]  Like when I rotated, Rakan was still jacking off in lane, right?
[24688.87s -> 24693.27s]  when I was here, Rakan was like way down here. So the support should have rotated first,
[24694.63s -> 24698.23s]  right? Like I rotated, but the support should have been the one rotating. But again, he's just,
[24698.87s -> 24702.15s]  a lot of the time you have support players who don't understand timers and how to help
[24702.15s -> 24706.23s]  jungle. Nobody plays for jungle. Support players hate playing for jungle in low elo,
[24707.03s -> 24714.15s]  so it's just not a thing. So I tried to go over and help him, but I misplaced my traps
[24714.15s -> 24723.27s]  a little bit and then the Graves had a flash but he got away and they tried to go in again when I
[24723.27s -> 24732.37s]  was too low to actually help we just got lucky we didn't lose the game off that shit kind of
[24732.37s -> 24752.29s]  does suck though Zaya's really strong now oh not bad I should have oh I should have I could
[24752.29s -> 24759.24s]  have killed her I suppose I could have killed the guy no joke I totally could have killed
[24759.24s -> 24764.60s]  them. If I had warded the lantern as he tried to take it, I would have killed the Xayah,
[24766.88s -> 24781.64s]  because she egoed the lantern there. She egoed the lantern so hard. If I had if I had warded it,
[24781.64s -> 24797.24s]  she dies there. That's my bad. This game's really interesting because
[24798.84s -> 24803.72s]  the enemy bot lane's actually misplaying a lot. Like they're they're really really really
[24803.72s -> 24811.72s]  misplaying these fights and trades and shit but uh we can't abuse it because the graves has so
[24811.72s -> 24816.76s]  much control of the game right now that we have to basically play safe permanently at the moment
[24816.76s -> 24820.20s]  and i can't do anything to help my team it feels really bad
[24827.28s -> 24839.20s]  one more kaisa game yeah there we go see look graves has bought again man this is so rough
[24848.63s -> 24867.04s]  graves is mad i want to kill this as fast as i can we can fight these guys two by two
[24867.04s -> 24883.54s]  actually wait why didn't he just go in i don't know why he didn't just w
[24883.54s -> 24886.66s]  immediately like the recon waited oh that tilts
[24886.66s -> 24889.86s]  me like when she was against the wall here
[24889.86s -> 24895.78s]  he should have immediately w'd her because
[24895.78s -> 24899.54s]  if he w's from vision there right and and she's against the wall
[24899.54s -> 24904.18s]  it helps us so much because then i can i can overlay my flame chumps on top
[24904.18s -> 24907.30s]  of the uh i can overlay my flame chumps
[24907.30s -> 24912.50s]  directly on top of the Zarya right as the fights happening rather than like having to
[24913.22s -> 24916.02s]  work around the fight because Thresh is in my face type shit you know
[24920.48s -> 24923.44s]  so we're just we're honestly just losing because we're not pulling the trigger fast enough
[24925.68s -> 24931.68s]  and we can't play aggressive when we can pull the trigger right like we're losing
[24931.68s -> 24934.80s]  because we can't pull the trigger fast enough and when we can pull the trigger it's uh the
[24934.80s -> 24942.28s]  wrong time we do this right now we get dragon the bot lane back do we get dragon here
[24942.28s -> 24952.61s]  I want to go uh, I actually want to go
[24955.98s -> 24957.98s]  With the enemy balling didn't back
[24958.22s -> 24959.82s]  Okay, they're trolling
[24959.82s -> 24964.88s]  They lost an objective for free here. This is really good
[24965.60s -> 24968.60s]  So the enemy balling we fight this by the way, we just we can just straight-up fight
[24978.62s -> 24982.94s]  That right there is how you lantern are you more to lantern by the way? Oh
[24985.30s -> 24987.30s]  I did that guy so dirty. Oh
[24992.22s -> 24994.22s]  I'm dead. Bye guys. I
[25000.97s -> 25002.97s]  Didn't know pantheon was Mia. That's my bad
[25003.19s -> 25007.09s]  I was like going I was too happy with warding the lantern
[25007.79s -> 25018.46s]  My bad. I can't believe the enemy team greeted that hard though for gold
[25019.14s -> 25024.63s]  Well, that's actually nuts to me
[25024.83s -> 25034.52s]  No, yeah, the the Ziya's egoing like crazy
[25036.04s -> 25041.50s]  The problem is I can't abuse it constantly because like obviously like I need teammates, right?
[25042.40s -> 25044.40s]  but I can kind of abuse it like
[25045.16s -> 25047.76s]  But it's much harder by yourself
[25048.46s -> 25055.13s]  Because as you can see like I'm not playing poorly, but we're getting like
[25056.05s -> 25057.89s]  We're getting shit on
[25057.89s -> 25059.89s]  Shit on is a bad word. We're getting like, oh
[25076.09s -> 25078.09s]  Come on, man
[25078.41s -> 25082.55s]  They misplayed that so badly
[25083.11s -> 25087.61s]  But Rakan just ate the fucking
[25088.89s -> 25094.97s]  Whatever. I'm not gonna blame Rakan. It's fine. I'm still sad about that though. They misplayed that so incredibly badly
[25096.21s -> 25098.21s]  like so badly
[25098.21s -> 25103.67s]  It was just that like Rekhaan all in the thresh with his ultimate, but all he had to do there was
[25104.37s -> 25110.53s]  Use his E to come back to me and then play front to back afterward, but he's he's out there autoing the thresh
[25111.45s -> 25115.95s]  But you don't need to auto him. You just need to engage and then I can maybe play out after it. I
[25120.27s -> 25126.56s]  Probably could have double killed them there too. I kind of messed up my team wants out
[25127.94s -> 25130.90s]  It's not it's it's silly because the game's not even over
[25134.71s -> 25137.23s]  Like we actually can win this game. So incredibly easily
[25138.39s -> 25143.43s]  So easily if we just play it correctly because their balling is really fucking bad. I
[25143.99s -> 25147.87s]  Didn't want to be mean but I'll just be mean their balling is really fucking bad
[25155.34s -> 25157.18s]  Well, I'm dead
[25157.18s -> 25159.18s]  They're still bad
[25159.94s -> 25162.90s]  I'm just egoing that was my ego. I
[25165.06s -> 25167.06s]  Still stand by it. I still think they're bad
[25167.06s -> 25173.24s]  This guy's just playing 1v3 mid. The Thresh has not been mid one time, so it must be the top laner.
[25173.24s -> 25181.47s]  I'm, I am so frustrated right now with this game.
[25185.68s -> 25191.18s]  Because I feel like we should have won so many all-ins that we didn't win barely, like one, like barely, right?
[25191.18s -> 25194.56s]  Like barely didn't win some all-ins. I feel like we should have won all of them.
[25196.64s -> 25200.66s]  Like they, they didn't land like a good all-in once. Thresh didn't land a single hook once.
[25200.66s -> 25207.22s]  And this is my Rakan like he just tried to he just used his R to try and engage
[25207.22s -> 25215.44s]  I think Nocturne is done mentally
[25216.20s -> 25221.17s]  Okay, so in games like this
[25221.37s -> 25225.07s]  Like this Thresh is so bad. Oh
[25248.21s -> 25250.21s]  Let's go, baby
[25250.61s -> 25252.17s]  Huge
[25252.17s -> 25257.40s]  That was so huge. Let's fucking go
[25275.10s -> 25280.90s]  Like I I'm gonna hit no at 15 because dude, I really don't want to lose to this Thresh and Nasaya
[25280.90s -> 25288.40s]  like this Thresh is doing the most the most ego shit I've ever seen and he's
[25288.40s -> 25293.66s]  just getting away with shit like right there Thresh walks up whiffs every spell
[25293.66s -> 25298.14s]  and expects to get away with that shit nah nah nah we win these we win these
[25298.14s -> 25303.10s]  trust give me let me cook let me cook I just need my team to let me cook a
[25303.10s -> 25308.50s]  bit you know like we had a bad early game had to play weak side let me
[25308.50s -> 25373.72s]  cook let me cook we are chilling if i landed that that would have been sick
[25373.72s -> 25385.60s]  the rest is top two we can kill this guy come on guys don't forfeit
[25385.60s -> 25391.84s]  guys the game is winnable oh my god dude the game is how is the rakan gonna
[25391.84s -> 25397.16s]  forfeit dude that game is so winnable it
[25397.16s -> 25407.48s]  hurts uh like dude really
[25407.48s -> 25413.34s]  That actually is so infuriating.
[25413.34s -> 25415.66s]  That's so infuriating, man.
[25415.66s -> 25418.38s]  That game was so incredibly winnable.
[25418.38s -> 25421.73s]  Like, look at this.
[25421.73s -> 25423.69s]  I did more damage than every single player
[25423.69s -> 25424.61s]  on the enemy team.
[25425.55s -> 25428.91s]  If my team just relaxed,
[25428.91s -> 25433.21s]  we win the game a thousand times over that game.
[25433.21s -> 25434.47s]  Like, the game is over.
[25436.05s -> 25437.73s]  We have a Rakan, a Rumble,
[25437.73s -> 25440.65s]  and a Wukong for me to sit behind.
[25440.65s -> 25443.37s]  And we saw how bad their bot lane was, right?
[25443.37s -> 25447.47s]  I have cleanse for the only way they can kill me.
[25447.47s -> 25448.31s]  Whatever, man.
[25448.31s -> 25450.15s]  Dude, I wish to God, I'm gonna report them all.
[25450.15s -> 25453.27s]  Like these fuckers, I guarantee I get a notification.
[25453.27s -> 25457.52s]  There's no way these people are not toxic.
[25457.52s -> 25460.52s]  There's no way you just want out of the game
[25460.52s -> 25463.92s]  after a fucking, your team is just doing well.
[25465.32s -> 25466.36s]  Nah, man.
[25466.36s -> 25468.64s]  The score is 10 to 14.
[25469.48s -> 25474.04s]  10 to 14.
[25474.04s -> 25481.50s]  You have a fed 80 carry.
[25481.50s -> 25482.34s]  Look at this.
[25482.34s -> 25483.38s]  Dude, we forfeited.
[25483.38s -> 25488.46s]  We were down 2.5K.
[25488.46s -> 25491.66s]  We had a better scaling comp than them.
[25491.66s -> 25493.14s]  Like we outscaled them.
[25494.94s -> 25496.62s]  We have two dragons.
[25496.62s -> 25498.82s]  We outscale them.
[25498.82s -> 25502.42s]  And we're down 2.5K.
[25502.42s -> 25505.02s]  And my team rage hits forfeit.
[25506.50s -> 25510.10s]  Oh my God, that's so gross.
[25510.10s -> 25518.98s]  That is so disgusting. So disgusting.
[25524.44s -> 25527.98s]  Why am I in a game with this player?
[25528.90s -> 25531.78s]  I'm 412 LP masters.
[25533.46s -> 25537.62s]  I was in a game just now with a seven LP masters jungler,
[25540.26s -> 25542.98s]  and he's not on a smurf. This is not a smurf account.
[25545.42s -> 25550.85s]  Because last season this guy was D4. So he's not on a smurf.
[25551.33s -> 25553.21s]  Why is this player in my game?
[25553.21s -> 25558.80s]  Why is this player in a 400 LP master game?
[25558.80s -> 25561.24s]  Why?
[25561.24s -> 25564.24s]  Or rather, why am I in a Diamond 1 game?
[25564.24s -> 25573.01s]  You can go to his previous games, he doesn't even have good MMR.
[25573.01s -> 25577.01s]  Like if you look at these games, they're all like, what, 100, 200 LP, right?
[25577.01s -> 25579.01s]  Why am I in this game?
[25579.01s -> 25581.01s]  Why did you put me in a game with this player?
[25581.01s -> 25585.45s]  Like this guy, I don't even care if he sucks.
[25585.45s -> 25590.45s]  I'm more frustrated at the fact that these players mental boom at the first sign of any negativity.
[25590.45s -> 25592.45s]  Look at this.
[25592.45s -> 25598.05s]  They just give up, first sign of anything negative, they go next.
[25598.05s -> 25601.61s]  Like I actually could have 1v9'd this game too, like actually.
[25601.61s -> 25605.13s]  But I'm not allowed to try and 1v9 because my team wants out of the game at fucking
[25605.13s -> 25607.93s]  four minutes, or fifteen minutes.
[25607.93s -> 25610.73s]  That sucks man.
[25610.73s -> 25613.13s]  The new system is trash.
[25613.13s -> 25618.53s]  Like I'm sorry, but the 4-foot-15 system is good sometimes.
[25618.53s -> 25622.13s]  They should have a requirement that you have to be losing by X amount of gold for
[25622.13s -> 25628.45s]  it to kick in. That should that should be it. They should have a requirement. You have to be losing
[25628.45s -> 25639.02s]  by 5k plus for it to work at 15. Like there needs to be something where there's a requirement
[25639.02s -> 25644.94s]  because people are so stupid. Right? Like that game was 100% ours. We had two dragons. We're
[25644.94s -> 25652.46s]  down 2000 gold at 16 minutes and Wukong's three and one. We were done four kills. Wukong's three
[25652.46s -> 25663.34s]  in one i'm i'm i'm literally insanely strong even though we got weaksided i'm still winning
[25663.34s -> 25666.38s]  we just 2v2ed them bot side of the map right like we just won a 2v2
[25668.46s -> 25675.58s]  rumbles just like like ah sorry i'm just mad i'm mad like they need to require they need to
[25675.58s -> 25680.62s]  require something other than four people like require four people and a gold lead or something
[25680.62s -> 25691.52s]  Like that's so cancer. That's so fucking frustrating man. Like I can't believe how bad people's mentals are
[25693.04s -> 25699.44s]  Like the okay, I get it the the rumble and the the rumble in the nocturne. I understand wanting to forfeit. Okay
[25700.00s -> 25703.84s]  Okay, they're having a bad game. They want out they're raging. They need to get their frustration. I get it
[25704.24s -> 25709.02s]  But why are we forfeiting?
[25709.18s -> 25710.54s]  when wukong
[25710.54s -> 25712.54s]  Is three and one?
[25712.86s -> 25716.70s]  I have seven of our kp. I'm the ad carry. I'm very strong. I just got my mythic
[25716.70s -> 25720.08s]  Like, we have two dragons.
[25720.08s -> 25726.88s]  And Rakan's forfeiting two- I don't know, man.
[25726.88s -> 25733.20s]  That's just frustrating, is all.
[25733.20s -> 25737.96s]  Like I'll be real, I carry this game every day of the week.
[25737.96s -> 25765.79s]  Every day of the week I carry those.
[25765.79s -> 25770.35s]  So apparently Riot is doing something about smurfing though, and I can't wait until
[25770.35s -> 25772.57s]  they do.
[25772.57s -> 25776.43s]  This is actually a really good thing that I wanted to talk about earlier in the stream,
[25776.43s -> 25783.33s]  I forgot apparently riot is like doing something to make smurfing harder because like apparently smurfing is outrageous right now and
[25783.83s -> 25787.41s]  I I kind of think that they need to stop this too
[25788.19s -> 25792.47s]  so there's a there's a thing you can do in solo queue right now where
[25793.35s -> 25797.69s]  You can make a new account and you can duo with somebody on
[25799.15s -> 25801.15s]  different accounts on a new account and
[25801.99s -> 25804.53s]  your MMR doesn't actually get like
[25804.53s -> 25816.79s]  like lowered. So if you win a game, let's say you win a game. I think this is just him
[25816.79s -> 25823.58s]  blabbering the account. But let's say let's say you win a game. And in that game, you
[25823.58s -> 25828.34s]  do it with somebody in a lower MMR, right? Now when you do in a lower MMR, I don't
[25828.34s -> 25831.90s]  know if this guy did this or not. But when you do somebody in a lower MMR,
[25831.90s -> 25837.22s]  your MMR is based on now the game thinks that you're in that MMR. And you can
[25837.22s -> 25842.46s]  do it in placements. So in your very first games, for some reason, there's no MMR lock
[25842.46s -> 25850.66s]  on placements. So you can in your placements, do it with somebody who's like bronze, right?
[25850.66s -> 25854.58s]  And you can play with them. And then the game thinks you're still winning. So it
[25854.58s -> 25859.52s]  keeps amplifying your MMR. So when I'm describing this really poorly, but essentially
[25859.52s -> 25864.82s]  you can do it in lower elos. And the game doesn't know your MMR belongs in that
[25864.82s -> 25869.62s]  elo because you're winning in that elo the game can't figure that out for some reason the algorithm
[25870.18s -> 25876.98s]  so when they stop duo queuing it still inflated them it still inflated their MMR to where it
[25876.98s -> 25882.98s]  would be if they had solo queued does that make sense and what i'm saying so it basically says
[25882.98s -> 25888.02s]  that they went like 10 and 0 in their placements right so now they're in like a master tier MMR
[25888.98s -> 25894.50s]  from a brand new account so now those people are in like D1 masters MMR but they played
[25894.82s -> 25900.55s]  They they won in gold. I also don't think
[25904.07s -> 25906.63s]  You smurfing should be so easily accessible
[25909.61s -> 25914.41s]  Like this guy's not a bad player per se but I don't think he's a master tier player, right?
[25914.41s -> 25916.41s]  Like this guy's a rumble player on a new account
[25917.05s -> 25920.89s]  I I from that game alone. The fact he gave up tells me he's not a good player
[25940.23s -> 25942.87s]  dude, i'm i'm a heavy advocate for like
[25943.67s -> 25947.59s]  Riot hat you have to attach like a verification to your accounts
[25947.59s -> 25953.87s]  I know Riot would never do that, but I'm a heavy advocate for having to attach verification
[25953.87s -> 25957.51s]  to play ranked.
[25957.51s -> 25961.86s]  I think it'd be great, honestly.
[25961.86s -> 25963.14s]  I think it would help so much.
[25963.14s -> 25977.41s]  If you get your verified account banned, are you done for?
[25977.41s -> 25978.41s]  Yeah.
[25978.41s -> 25981.17s]  You have to get a VPN to play, other than you would have to.
[25981.17s -> 25983.93s]  That's my point though.
[25983.93s -> 25989.77s]  If you get your verified account banned, that account's done.
[25989.77s -> 26011.90s]  Like I said, I don't think Riot would ever do it because it's too extreme and I don't
[26011.90s -> 26014.26s]  think Riot has the balls to ever do that shit.
[26014.26s -> 26015.74s]  VPN is only $5.
[26015.74s -> 26019.98s]  Yeah, but dude, are you going to tell me that you're going to buy it?
[26019.98s -> 26023.68s]  People who get banned on accounts typically get banned consistently.
[26023.68s -> 26027.38s]  That's why they're making Smurfs, right?
[26027.38s -> 26031.30s]  So you're telling me somebody is going to be willing to pay $5 for a new phone
[26031.30s -> 26035.62s]  number verification or whatever. Every time they have to make a new account.
[26035.98s -> 26054.56s]  They're not not you me. Yeah. Okay. Don't I have Smurfs? Yeah, I do. And I
[26054.56s -> 26059.90s]  stand by all my Smurfs should be attached to the same like account. Like
[26059.92s -> 26064.82s]  if you make a Smurf, okay, this is what I think should happen. You should
[26064.82s -> 26069.10s]  be able to put all of your Smurfs on one account. So you can make Smurfs
[26069.10s -> 26073.68s]  and you can add that Smurf verification to an account.
[26073.68s -> 26075.56s]  But it kind of like battle.net.
[26075.56s -> 26076.68s]  Does that make sense?
[26076.68s -> 26078.80s]  You know how like battle.net has all your accounts
[26078.80s -> 26080.04s]  in the battle.net thing,
[26080.04s -> 26082.22s]  but you can sign into battle.net?
[26082.22s -> 26084.84s]  I think that the way to make it viable
[26084.84s -> 26086.88s]  would be like, you could put all,
[26086.88s -> 26088.64s]  if you didn't have a second phone number
[26088.64s -> 26089.60s]  or didn't want one,
[26089.60s -> 26091.76s]  you could put Smurfs up to like a limit.
[26091.76s -> 26093.08s]  So you could have like three Smurfs
[26093.08s -> 26095.20s]  or like two Smurfs in your main account, right?
[26095.20s -> 26097.40s]  So you could have like three total accounts
[26097.40s -> 26099.12s]  and you would have to like,
[26099.12s -> 26102.80s]  you could add those to the same like Omega account, right?
[26102.80s -> 26105.44s]  And that Omega account could be your verified account.
[26105.44s -> 26107.52s]  Now, if any of your accounts get punished
[26107.52s -> 26115.30s]  on your Omega account, all of your accounts get punished.
[26115.30s -> 26116.62s]  So if any of your accounts get punished,
[26116.62s -> 26130.04s]  all of them get punished.
[26130.04s -> 26132.28s]  Like I feel like that'd be a good play.
[26132.28s -> 26134.28s]  Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like it would work.
[26134.28s -> 26135.52s]  Yo, what's up Rush?
[26135.52s -> 26141.57s]  I called you Rush, what's up RF?
[26141.57s -> 26142.73s]  What do I wanna play?
[26143.77s -> 26145.47s]  I don't know.
[26145.47s -> 26149.06s]  I don't know what I wanna do here.
[26149.06s -> 26154.70s]  I wish I didn't have cleanse cleanse is so worthless this game like actually
[26156.38s -> 26158.38s]  When there's nothing this game at all
[26158.94s -> 26163.88s]  I'm just down to some like maybe if the brand like tries to flash stun me or some shit
[26164.18s -> 26179.36s]  But I'm just like down a summoner. All right boys
[26180.34s -> 26186.45s]  We got night blue three on our team. There's a throwback
[26247.67s -> 26258.34s]  Him oh we got him I'm not gonna lie. I kind of looked like I was scripting
[26258.84s -> 26264.48s]  That movement, like if I was watching the game, I'd be like, what the fuck was that?
[26264.48s -> 26269.24s]  Like, my movement was real sus.
[26269.24s -> 26305.97s]  On that like, that all-in right there, that was some, that was some sus movement.
[26305.97s -> 26319.40s]  We can gank these guys, they have no, oh, there's gonna be a ward in here.
[26319.40s -> 26322.04s]  These people have no flashes.
[26322.04s -> 26326.60s]  Enemy bot lane has no flash, this should be a free kill, honestly.
[26326.60s -> 26330.16s]  We just let these guys push in, they can't walk up, and we just play for that.
[26335.04s -> 26338.80s]  Even if they try and 3v3, we should just win the 3v3 because we're stronger.
[26346.15s -> 26347.75s]  Oh, this guy's just dead. Yeah, that's...
[26358.36s -> 26359.72s]  I need level three.
[26363.24s -> 26365.08s]  I kind of fucked my entire wave here.
[26366.44s -> 26367.40s]  Yo, can we push?
[26369.74s -> 26371.06s]  Is there any way we can just push this?
[26378.15s -> 26378.79s]  Ooh, nice.
[26389.92s -> 26391.36s]  Nice, well played.
[26392.88s -> 26393.40s]  Nice job.
[26394.40s -> 26396.36s]  My Lulu's fucking fed as shit.
[26404.22s -> 26408.14s]  I should have gone free boots this game. I didn't think about it
[26409.82s -> 26414.60s]  Cuz uh, I don't need sork this game, you know, I was like the last game
[26414.60s -> 26417.12s]  I told you I was going boots. I went boots for the
[26418.26s -> 26422.60s]  You know the fast boot to rush for thresh. I don't need that this game because
[26423.46s -> 26432.92s]  We just went through like faster mythic. So I should have gone free boots for like more efficiency
[26432.92s -> 26472.95s]  I wanna push this wave, so we don't get like shit on.
[26472.95s -> 26505.85s]  I'm gonna just kill a man, and you can't understand.
[26505.85s -> 26516.49s]  Just kill a man, kill a man, there is something you can't understand.
[26516.49s -> 26559.26s]  I could go back here but I don't see any reason to go back yet. I think I'm dead
[26565.32s -> 26569.36s]  I misplayed that that was actually really good by Lulu cooldowns. No, you're fine, man
[26569.36s -> 26574.44s]  I wish I could I wish I could tell him that he played it fine. I messed up not him. I messed up
[26574.44s -> 26579.10s]  I I feel bad. I want to like say no you're fine
[26579.70s -> 26585.63s]  Cuz that was my bad. I
[26585.75s -> 26586.63s]  Should have okay
[26586.63s -> 26591.07s]  So when I flashed and I was running away from the twitch right the second that twitch flashed on me
[26591.07s -> 26593.07s]  I should have instantly started autoing him
[26593.27s -> 26598.53s]  Like I and it was one extra auto like one single extra auto and it would have been fine
[26599.05s -> 26603.48s]  Why can't I tell her?
[26603.48s -> 26607.94s]  You know, I just choose not to type anymore
[26608.74s -> 26612.78s]  It's my choice
[26612.78s -> 26620.61s]  You know, yeah my choice
[26639.66s -> 26641.66s]  Guys actually doing that, huh?
[26644.35s -> 26646.35s]  We win to be too really fucking hard
[26647.67s -> 26649.67s]  Especially with tier two boots, but I need uh
[26650.67s -> 26668.18s]  Dude I am doing some scripty shit. I don't be real
[26669.04s -> 26678.86s]  Dude Lulu wasn't six. I thought she was six. I'm so bad. I
[26681.74s -> 26685.10s]  Wish I could tell her my bad again. I'm actually trolling
[26686.14s -> 26689.90s]  like I ran out of mana because I'm bad and then I
[26690.70s -> 26693.36s]  and
[26693.36s -> 26698.16s]  Then I thought she was six so I walked up to like take tank the turret for a second, right?
[26698.28s -> 26700.88s]  Cuz I was like, oh shit. Maybe I'll get like maybe we can kill this guy
[26700.88s -> 26704.52s]  Maybe Lulu has a spell or something. I just oh I played bad my bad
[26710.54s -> 26721.49s]  W that make sure Akro's not there. I feel I actually just feel so bad because the Lulu is actually playing really
[26721.49s -> 26723.49s]  It's like the best support I've had all day
[26723.53s -> 26725.53s]  Like this guy's actually impressing me, right?
[26725.89s -> 26727.89s]  Like this guy's playing really well
[26727.97s -> 26760.62s]  And I'm just griefing
[26760.62s -> 26765.66s]  Lulu gave her life for me
[26765.66s -> 26767.66s]  Lulu gave her life for me boys
[26769.48s -> 26772.36s]  Can we get a a salute for Lulu and chat boys?
[26772.36s -> 26803.79s]  Can we get a salute? Can we get some love for Lulu? She gave her life for the homie.
[26803.79s -> 26810.19s]  Honestly, that was a really cool 2v2 by the way. Oh, Nightblue smurfing it. What the
[26810.19s -> 26844.71s]  fuck? Yo, kill that bitch too. Nice. No. Oh, I lost that cannon. I would have lost
[26844.71s -> 26880.97s]  my life in game I'm gonna go BT second item we have Lulu so wait what the fuck
[26880.97s -> 26885.85s]  is this pathing I click to go bot and it pats me in the weirdest spot ever we
[26885.85s -> 26890.33s]  have Lulu so I could actually go IE second but I think if I go BT I'll be
[26890.33s -> 26897.88s]  actually unkillable like it'll be the greatest thing ever I actually still
[26897.88s -> 26900.80s]  might go IE as I'm thinking about it out loud by saying we have Lulu and
[26900.80s -> 26906.40s]  Not be stupid, but hey, I guess don't might you know, I still might go IE, but I don't know yet
[26906.40s -> 26909.16s]  We'll see cuz I took a lacquer D. So it's like
[26910.28s -> 26925.13s]  Wow
[26925.13s -> 26949.18s]  No, I'm gonna die. I
[26949.20s -> 26951.20s]  Mean, I don't know why I flashed away
[26952.92s -> 26955.90s]  I'm playing bad. It's my fault. I
[26957.20s -> 26961.60s]  Think the game's over. So I'm just I'm playing bad. I'm like limit testing a little bit too much
[26972.61s -> 26993.46s]  today
[27024.63s -> 27028.84s]  Help, help, help.
[27055.77s -> 27057.77s]  Surprised they haven't forfeited, though, what the fuck?
[27057.97s -> 27060.85s]  Dude, how does this game?
[27061.05s -> 27064.21s]  Oh, I'm even more mad, you guys have no idea.
[27064.41s -> 27066.29s]  So I.
[27067.01s -> 27070.89s]  It's 24 to 8, the enemy team doesn't forfeit,
[27071.09s -> 27075.53s]  but my team forfeits when the score is 10 to 14.
[27075.53s -> 27077.53s]  And we're only down a thousand golds
[27095.43s -> 27097.07s]  Sorry, I was
[27097.07s -> 27099.07s]  That was my bad. I was tilted by
[27099.87s -> 27105.46s]  You know, I was thinking about about how they weren't forfeiting and I was getting mad
[27106.98s -> 27111.64s]  It is a little interesting cuz like I said, they still can't win so I don't know who the fuck setting no
[27111.64s -> 27115.06s]  But it's probably echo. Well, no, I go is definitely heading though. But like who else
[27116.90s -> 27128.66s]  Maybe brand maybe ribbon. Hey ribbons like yeah, they did just get a thousand gold
[27128.66s -> 27139.16s]  All right, I should probably stop trolling. I'd feel pretty silly if we lost cuz I'm bad
[27139.78s -> 27144.20s]  After we like dumpstered him in lane that hard. I feel pretty silly if we lost cuz I keep getting caught
[27161.58s -> 27163.58s]  All right, I should be unkillable now
[27163.70s -> 27168.12s]  Like I'm not even farming. I'm actually griefing. I
[27168.84s -> 27170.56s]  Should probably go make dinner after this game
[27170.56s -> 27175.48s]  I want to keep playing cuz I'm playing well today, but like dude my brain is starting to go like
[27175.96s -> 27180.84s]  I probably need to go make some food. I'm getting the full ADHD brain experience going
[27180.84s -> 27200.95s]  So let's see if I can muster all my focus.
[27200.95s -> 27205.11s]  Let's see if I can muster up all my focus really quick just for push out and finish
[27205.11s -> 27209.73s]  this game.
[27209.73s -> 27213.17s]  We'll go Terminator mode for the end of this game right now.
[27213.17s -> 27224.59s]  We'll muster up all of the focus.
[27224.59s -> 27225.59s]  Demon mode engaged boys.
[27225.59s -> 27277.71s]  God, that sounded really cringe.
[27277.71s -> 27279.03s]  I'm actually really impressed though.
[27279.03s -> 27280.83s]  Nightblue played this game really, really well.
[27280.83s -> 27284.46s]  Like I'll be honest.
[27284.46s -> 27289.72s]  My last like thought of Nightblue was him being bad at League.
[27289.72s -> 27295.29s]  He played this game really well.
[27295.29s -> 27297.13s]  My man's gotten so much better.
[27297.13s -> 27305.10s]  Okay, nobody saw that.
[27305.10s -> 27306.10s]  Nobody saw that.
[27306.10s -> 27307.10s]  Nobody saw that.
[27307.10s -> 27308.10s]  Nobody saw that.
[27308.10s -> 27309.10s]  Nobody saw that.
[27309.10s -> 27310.10s]  Nobody saw that.
[27310.10s -> 27311.10s]  Nobody saw that.
[27311.10s -> 27322.14s]  Not one of you saw me flash after the Ekko ulted, not one of you.
[27322.14s -> 27323.14s]  Wasted flash?
[27323.14s -> 27325.18s]  No, that was assertive flash.
[27325.18s -> 27328.38s]  An assertive dominant flash.
[27328.38s -> 27330.02s]  Wasted at all
[27330.02s -> 27338.82s]  They might actually go for Baron here. We should look for this
[27340.66s -> 27351.12s]  Like they could try oh he's here pretty sure the ribbons here too, though
[27352.82s -> 27359.08s]  Yep, I did not mean to do that. I didn't mean to hit the thing. I accidentally hit the blast plants
[27360.50s -> 27363.56s]  That was that was an accident it was a it was a literal pure accident
[27366.35s -> 27368.23s]  like I I
[27368.23s -> 27371.47s]  Did not mean to hit it. I was like I know ribbons here
[27371.47s -> 27377.03s]  I'm gonna wait for Yasuo before I go over or before I do this right and I'm gonna bait him and I just completely
[27377.15s -> 27382.95s]  Whiffed every like I'm bad. We'll leave it at I'm bad. That's a good way to put I'm bad. I'm hungry
[27382.95s -> 27385.71s]  I'm old. I'm bald. I'm bad. Nothing else to say
[27386.87s -> 27388.87s]  short to short mad
[27402.61s -> 27405.15s]  Yeah, that was a pedestrian flash
[27405.15s -> 27410.39s]  It is she as well. Oh, yeah, it's it's a plethora a plethora of
[27411.11s -> 27418.04s]  Terrible things. I still got to go to the gym tonight, too
[27418.96s -> 27444.37s]  said spot
[27444.37s -> 27445.73s]  Okay
[27445.73s -> 27447.93s]  I'm a little nervous of like getting flanked
[27449.13s -> 27451.13s]  Right there junglers could just like sit in places
[27452.09s -> 27470.76s]  Nice. We got top and him not bad
[27471.52s -> 27473.52s]  Yeah, I mean we just try and get mid and hip here
[27475.20s -> 27477.20s]  Well, let's go help our homie though
[27477.20s -> 27500.58s]  Like I'm actually so sad I'm playing so bad
[27501.90s -> 27506.62s]  Like I was playing so good at the start and now I'm playing so bad. It actually makes me sad. I
[27516.05s -> 27518.05s]  Was tanking for that guy?
[27529.16s -> 27544.57s]  Alright, let's just leave. I don't want to I don't want to throw the game for my my teammates because like I'm getting like, you know
[27546.99s -> 27583.06s]  I've already died five times like a dipshit. Oh, where'd he go? We should just push bot honestly
[27584.84s -> 27597.96s]  We don't even need this dragon fuck it. We just i'm just gonna push bot
[27644.24s -> 27658.90s]  Not bad
[27658.90s -> 27660.58s]  Not bad at all
[27660.58s -> 27663.38s]  I gotta give it. I want to give it to nightblue, but I gotta give it to this lulu
[27664.42s -> 27666.42s]  Lulu played that game so good
[27669.03s -> 27671.35s]  I gotta give it to lulu. She played so fucking good
[27676.34s -> 27692.45s]  Like actually
[27692.45s -> 27707.22s]  I don't even know if she's still in here
[27712.88s -> 27722.21s]  I'm not a scripter
[27722.21s -> 27724.21s]  She thinks i'm a no i'm serious
[27732.85s -> 27738.98s]  She thinks i'm a scripter
[27739.22s -> 27758.72s]  Bro, I'm streaming
[27758.88s -> 27761.00s]  Dude the homie thought I'm a scripter
[27761.76s -> 27766.68s]  You know, I'll take it. My ego feels good
[27776.07s -> 27778.07s]  Honestly, that feels good. That feels good
[27778.55s -> 27783.88s]  Hi, well
[27783.88s -> 27785.88s]  That was a scripted dude. I'm not gonna lie though
[27786.28s -> 27789.40s]  Some of those movements were sus as fuck that I was making
[27789.92s -> 27794.32s]  Like I was I like I like turned on the fucking mental scripts for that game
[27794.64s -> 27797.00s]  Some of those movements early were nuts
[27797.00s -> 27806.02s]  Like like just like this tiny little tiny little movements. I was doing early game in lane. We're crazy
[27806.38s -> 27816.59s]  Like look at this watch this like this movement right here, right? Like look I dodge that right?
[27817.51s -> 27820.93s]  Then I walk up cleanse the thing kite down
[27821.55s -> 27829.80s]  Like that that movement is gross man. Look
[27832.14s -> 27836.52s]  That was actually some gross ass movement. I'm not gonna lie. Look at this
[27836.52s -> 27850.36s]  in the corner man in the corner my brain was like yo Andromeda thank you man yo
[27850.36s -> 27856.04s]  you played really good now I felt bad I felt so bad because I was griefing like
[27856.04s -> 27860.56s]  I was like at the start of the game we were just snow like I literally fucked
[27860.56s -> 27864.52s]  up like three times during like the really important fights and I was like
[27864.52s -> 27865.52s]  Oh, no.
[27870.40s -> 27871.40s]  Yeah, thank you for the bits.
[27872.00s -> 27873.00s]  Can I play Kalista?
[27873.20s -> 27874.20s]  I can.
[27878.25s -> 27880.61s]  I'm trying to figure out if I want to play a Kalista game
[27881.05s -> 27882.17s]  or if I want to go make dinner.
[27889.13s -> 27891.89s]  There was one other movement that I thought was kind of nuts.
[27892.05s -> 27894.29s]  I did a really good movement to somewhere.
[27894.29s -> 27895.29s]  I don't remember what it was.
[27898.54s -> 27899.66s]  Here's where I fucked up.
[27899.98s -> 27902.66s]  So right now, I should have just been
[27903.02s -> 27906.38s]  for some reason, my brain lagged and I should have just been sitting here.
[27907.94s -> 27910.66s]  I should have just cleansed and then started fighting the Twitch.
[27911.22s -> 27914.70s]  For some reason I didn't cleanse, but this wasn't like your fault at all.
[27914.70s -> 27920.00s]  Like I- the second the Twitch flashed, I should have insta-cleansed the Ignite and I should have just been killing him.
[27920.46s -> 27923.34s]  Like right now just like autoing because I can't get away from him, right?
[27923.34s -> 27926.66s]  It- but it took me an extra second. See how I- I started fighting him now.
[27929.61s -> 27936.17s]  Like I barely died. I wouldn't have died had I cleansed and had I just turned initially. It was fine.
[27937.01s -> 27946.36s]  And then like here I fucked up too because I went in and I thought we were six.
[27946.36s -> 27960.76s]  Oh, I could have killed that guy. I should have gone forward one more. Oh, you know what I should have done there
[27960.76s -> 27965.82s]  I should have gone forward one more auto killed this guy Lulu would have gotten six off of the kill
[27965.82s -> 27970.48s]  I would have used my speed to come back out. Then she could have ulted me we could have killed the
[27971.52s -> 27974.52s]  We could have got the twitch and then we could have turned on this echo too. Oh
[27981.82s -> 27984.30s]  This was a really cool 2v2. I
[27985.58s -> 27987.58s]  Actually thought this 2v2 was really sick
[27987.58s -> 27998.51s]  Lulu's a real one for this man. Listen, you're a real one for this one. You just took the
[27998.51s -> 28020.39s]  death to save me. Respect. You're a real one for that. That was so good. Jesus was fun.
[28020.39s -> 28024.43s]  Yeah, jeez. You were the best support I've had today. Like legitimately, you played
[28024.43s -> 28028.07s]  better than all the other players in the sealer. That was really good. Like I was
[28028.07s -> 28032.49s]  surprised. I was telling my stream. I was like, yeah, she's actually like they
[28032.49s -> 28037.53s]  said she because you're a little I don't know you know but I was like yeah she's playing super good
[28037.53s -> 28047.34s]  she's playing way better than all of my fucking teammates yo uh what time is it it's six
[28048.62s -> 28052.46s]  man do I want to do I want to keep streaming or do I want to go to or do I want to go get
[28052.46s -> 28059.08s]  food and uh go to the gym I can't like 24 hour fitness is not actually 24 anymore
[28059.64s -> 28068.12s]  so I'd have to go soon if I'm gonna go to the gym but it is only like six
[28079.13s -> 28083.18s]  But I could just end on I
[28084.10s -> 28092.43s]  Could just end on hitting the like 400 LP mark and just chill for now, right? Like we have 400 LP
[28092.43s -> 28094.43s]  We'll probably hit GM tomorrow
[28095.63s -> 28098.39s]  So I could just chill for now and then we can just hit GM tomorrow
[28098.95s -> 28107.63s]  That's probably a better idea because then I won't get mad like say say we get like like say we get another game like this
[28107.63s -> 28109.31s]  right
[28109.31s -> 28114.29s]  Like say we get another game like this where like we're literally winning the game and my team's like no
[28114.29s -> 28118.21s]  Let's forfeit like that's gonna make me mad. I was mad. This is gonna make me mad, right? Like I
[28118.93s -> 28123.17s]  So I'd rather just like get off on a good note like a happy note, you know, like not be tilted
[28129.72s -> 28135.40s]  GM tomorrow. Yeah, I hope so. I've been I think I can get challenger back this year, but we got to get to GM first
[28136.28s -> 28138.76s]  I'm telling you I this elo is so miserable
[28139.40s -> 28141.40s]  like master tier
[28141.40s -> 28146.28s]  Is the worst elo i've ever played in in my 12 years?
[28147.00s -> 28149.00s]  Of playing this game
[28149.00s -> 28156.00s]  Whatever NA 300-400 LP Masters is, is literally disgusting.
[28156.00s -> 28159.00s]  These are not real people.
[28159.00s -> 28167.00s]  Like, I feel like half these games we are playing with NPCs who quite literally don't even...
[28167.00s -> 28170.00s]  Like, I don't even know what to say. They're bots.
[28170.00s -> 28173.00s]  And they can't be real humans. They get mad over nothing.
[28173.00s -> 28175.00s]  They rage quit over nothing.
[28175.00s -> 28178.80s]  Nothing. They give up at 15 minutes when we're winning the game.
[28179.30s -> 28181.00s]  These cannot be real people.
[28182.91s -> 28187.31s]  So I swear to God the game has to get better in GM.
[28187.41s -> 28188.61s]  It has to get better.
[28189.11s -> 28192.11s]  There's no world that it gets worse.
[28193.21s -> 28195.21s]  Like I refuse to believe that.
[28196.21s -> 28198.71s]  Because this is this is the worst grind I've ever had.
[28202.92s -> 28204.02s]  Is it bad to be a bot?
[28206.77s -> 28207.97s]  Are you saying I'm botist?
[28210.24s -> 28213.34s]  Are you going to cancel me because I because I don't like bots.
[28213.34s -> 28219.06s]  I said it. I'm saying it. I don't like fucking bots. Well, okay. I didn't need to add fuck.
[28219.06s -> 28221.46s]  You know what? We're just gonna I'm gonna get off. I'm gonna. Yeah, that's it. That's
[28221.46s -> 28227.14s]  it for me. I'm gonna get off was I'm tired. I need to go to the gym before I run out
[28227.14s -> 28232.10s]  of juice. Make some dinner. I will be live tomorrow. Same time as today. I've been
[28232.10s -> 28239.20s]  starting my stream at 10am. My time. Maybe I'll do it tomorrow at 9am. I don't know.
[28239.20s -> 28247.04s]  10 or 9 between there I always start my stream and so uh and that's my time so it's like 7 8 9 pst
[28248.00s -> 28254.32s]  you're good at 88 thanks man I think I suck my goal is hopefully I can get challenger back
[28255.28s -> 28260.80s]  and then I'm not gonna play like I just want to my goal is challenger so that I can prove to
[28260.80s -> 28266.80s]  myself it's a really stupid thing but I want to prove to myself that I can still do it at 32
[28266.80s -> 28270.64s]  because 10 years ago was the first time I started streaming this year right I've
[28270.64s -> 28275.56s]  been streaming for 10 years this year and so I want to get challenger because
[28275.56s -> 28278.24s]  when I first started streaming I was in challenger and I want to see if like
[28278.24s -> 28284.86s]  after 10 years I can still do it and then I'm never gonna care again this
[28284.86s -> 28287.96s]  will be the only time I ever give a shit about getting challenger I just
[28287.96s -> 28292.80s]  want to get it see if I care and then play for content you know but uh
[28292.80s -> 28296.48s]  Uh, yeah, it's just it's just like welcome to the league of draven
[28297.60s -> 28300.80s]  see if the old man who has fucking arthritis and
[28301.68s -> 28305.12s]  Fucking carpal tunnel and all that shit. You know what? I mean, see if I can still do it
[28306.96s -> 28309.84s]  Yo, thank you for the twitch prime man. I appreciate it. Thank you so much
[28310.40s -> 28312.00s]  Appreciate it a lot dude
[28312.00s -> 28313.36s]  All right guys, that's gonna be it for me
[28313.36s -> 28317.68s]  If you like to stream don't forget to follow all my socials and tiktok and facebook and instagram and all that shit
[28318.08s -> 28320.88s]  All the clickable garbage is underneath the stream. Don't forget to check it out
[28320.88s -> 28324.46s]  I'll be back tomorrow same time in the morning. I
[28325.76s -> 28331.86s]  Tomorrow's my last day for the weekend though. I'm not gonna stream on Saturday. I might do some off off stream grinding on Saturday
[28332.00s -> 28335.20s]  I've been taking I've been like forcing myself to take a day off of streaming
[28335.80s -> 28341.36s]  Every week just so like I can mentally recharge and I think it's actually been really good for my stream
[28341.76s -> 28345.72s]  because like I've been in a much better mood while streaming and I've been much less tilted and I've been
[28345.72s -> 28351.20s]  And even if I play League off stream or whatever, it's just like, it doesn't feel as forced.
[28351.20s -> 28352.62s]  So I feel like the break's nice.
[28352.62s -> 28355.52s]  So yeah, tomorrow, no stream on Saturday, tomorrow for sure.
[28355.52s -> 28357.92s]  And Sunday I might, I might do a short stream.
[28357.92s -> 28360.00s]  But yeah, I'll see you guys then.
[28360.00s -> 28361.00s]  Thanks for watching.
[28361.00s -> 28363.56s]  I appreciate you guys.
[28363.56s -> 28364.56s]  And yeah, that's it.
[28364.56s -> 28365.56s]  I'm gonna go make dinner.
[28365.56s -> 28371.84s]  I hope you guys have a good night, day, wherever the fuck you are.
[28371.84s -> 28372.84s]  Later dudes.
[28372.84s -> 28373.84s]  Hope you guys have a good one.
[28373.84s -> 28374.84s]  It was fun playing Andromeda.

[28377.72s -> 28378.72s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[28378.72s -> 28379.56s]  Peace.
