[190.19s -> 196.58s]  Yeah, guy has G.P.
[207.60s -> 208.60s]  Bees.
[215.22s -> 216.72s]  Jesus.
[254.21s -> 255.81s]  Yo, eh, what's up man?
[270.13s -> 271.13s]  What's up dudes?
[318.98s -> 320.98s]  Yeah, I mean we're hoping.
[325.65s -> 327.41s]  We'll see man, we'll see.
[330.21s -> 331.81s]  Fingers fucking cross, right?
[389.61s -> 391.91s]  Do I ever actually...
[405.53s -> 406.73s]  I'm wondering if I...
[406.73s -> 408.53s]  I'm assuming I'm just playing a math.
[461.42s -> 463.44s]  Yo, where, yay!
[475.46s -> 478.02s]  Yeah, this is probably just me doing fucking...
[478.30s -> 484.36s]  I'm probably just doing Star Guardian.
[498.34s -> 502.48s]  Well come to the wall. It's never on time for the 27-months man, you're a
[503.46s -> 530.88s]  Appreciate the lot dude. Thank you, and I could probably still go in finneteen, but it's my hold in the solution
[531.68s -> 533.68s]  But I haven't seen any sever or anything
[534.80s -> 619.63s]  So I'd be kind of awkward, you know, this guy's definitely gonna be me. That guy's
[620.83s -> 624.83s]  I see why he hasn't lost. That's just five infinity team already Jesus Christ
[624.83s -> 751.74s]  I was like man, why is that guy so strong and then I realized so I go to seven next rounds
[778.74s -> 806.08s]  and then hopefully we could hit some shit. I kind of like this actually because now we can make
[807.84s -> 842.30s]  I can actually make a guard breaker and I can also make a guard breaker and math. I kind of want
[842.30s -> 848.72s]  I want to just ionize Spark, but I don't know if I should.
[848.72s -> 854.00s]  I need an echo, a Nico, or a Ral.
[854.00s -> 856.20s]  That's what could use an Ezreal.
[856.20s -> 857.76s]  I need a quick draw.
[857.76s -> 861.36s]  I should have kept that moosh in from earlier.
[861.36s -> 949.60s]  This guy's a level 3 Blitzcrank and he's just so fucking strong that's stupid.
[949.60s -> 950.60s]  This is really interesting.
[950.60s -> 958.08s]  I guess I could go spell-singer as well.
[958.08s -> 1041.90s]  And we just give the shiv to TF, we just do this for now too, I guess I could use I could do dual gauntlet
[1041.90s -> 1104.85s]  I don't know could dual gauntlet this shit up, there it goes, I need to like throw an item down
[1104.85s -> 1118.20s]  But I feel like Morrell is bad, I guess I could just use hat or I guess I would have
[1118.20s -> 1128.10s]  before Jold got it, could be good.
[1128.10s -> 1147.04s]  Oh no, I could just roll on seven, two,
[1147.04s -> 1152.74s]  try and three stars stuff.
[1152.74s -> 1154.94s]  This guy has three kises though.
[1154.94s -> 1159.66s]  This guy has one kise.
[1159.66s -> 1160.98s]  Kind of hard to three star kise.
[1160.98s -> 1190.74s]  I could three star niva.
[1190.74s -> 1193.54s]  Like I said, eight with fucking 20 gold,
[1195.34s -> 1196.54s]  here he has MF,
[1197.86s -> 1354.40s]  and he'd, what's great since saying,
[1354.40s -> 1356.40s]  you that NAR just murked me.
[1357.48s -> 1359.04s]  I did not position for the NAR,
[1359.04s -> 1371.22s]  And I got fucked for it.
[1371.22s -> 1399.32s]  This motherfucker.
[1399.32s -> 1402.82s]  Should I wish I could get some stick frontline leveled up?
[1402.82s -> 1404.82s]  That'd be cool.
[1430.78s -> 1460.07s]  Oh my god, another NAR.
[1460.07s -> 1543.51s]  Well, rip.
[1543.51s -> 1547.51s]  I wasn't going to go MF and then I decided to go Nico and then I just fucked it all up.
[1547.51s -> 1551.53s]  Oh, wow.
[1551.53s -> 1572.70s]  Time is it 10?
[1597.10s -> 1599.10s]  Oh
[1618.83s -> 1620.83s]  What's up boys?
[1620.83s -> 1645.38s]  That's how everybody doing. Oh, I'll be right back. So I'm still waking up with me. Give me one sec.
[1646.58s -> 1648.58s]  Subscribe
[1674.70s -> 1676.70s]  Okay
[1676.70s -> 1679.76s]  Oh
[1679.76s -> 1683.04s]  Yeah, baby. I wasn't gonna play on my main at the start, but dude
[1683.04s -> 1687.28s]  I don't know if I can sit through fucking 8 minute queue times to get people raging at each other all day
[1687.84s -> 1703.90s]  So we'll do some warm-up on this account for a bit, what of Mars's count?
[1703.90s -> 1706.38s]  Like D1, Bo Master.
[1706.38s -> 1717.54s]  Like, by their accounts, like 500, this one's, I want to say like,
[1717.54s -> 1721.34s]  I don't know, the animal is really awkward when you get like,
[1721.34s -> 1723.78s]  well, masters, right? Like, the animal is super awkward.
[1723.78s -> 1726.50s]  So I don't know what the animal is, but I know it's a little masters.
[1726.50s -> 1728.82s]  So like, sometimes there's, sometimes there's, like,
[1728.82s -> 1732.66s]  100 LP players, somewhere between there.
[1732.66s -> 1741.76s]  Dude, I
[1741.76s -> 1744.64s]  I put some games off stream yesterday. I got up to like 400 LP
[1745.76s -> 1756.06s]  Then I've lost three in a row. That shit was painful. I did
[1756.70s -> 1774.50s]  Into one of tenacity's games though, so that was fun. That felt bad. No, yeah straight up. It felt so bad. He was doing so good to like I straight up
[1774.50s -> 1782.05s]  Just had a bad game and I felt I felt like shit. I'll be this shit. I just dropped like eight deaths. Look at the shits
[1782.05s -> 1791.05s]  But he was just straight up smurfing on the enemy top laner and we all the entire team
[1791.05s -> 1802.54s]  just like decided to collectively run it down, like we all just got shit on.
[1802.54s -> 1809.89s]  This was a really weird game because I feel like that game was like the first game I felt
[1809.89s -> 1814.89s]  everybody in the game was like actually high GM challenger but they weren't rated that.
[1814.89s -> 1822.66s]  It's a very weird system going on.
[1822.66s -> 1829.94s]  Let's do a Cassiope again.
[1829.94s -> 1831.94s]  But all of us know you guys what I mean in a second.
[1831.94s -> 1839.09s]  I'm assuming I should go this, right?
[1839.09s -> 1846.11s]  This is probably good.
[1846.11s -> 1848.11s]  Or this?
[1848.11s -> 1849.11s]  That's probably good too.
[1849.11s -> 1855.46s]  Oh, well.
[1855.46s -> 1858.46s]  Okay, so, yeah, look at this stuff.
[1858.46s -> 1863.46s]  Like, Nian Tonso is like, he's been challenging for a long time, right?
[1863.46s -> 1866.46s]  I don't even know who the fuck this guy was.
[1866.46s -> 1875.86s]  some random sent a player who's like not playing sent a no and then this guy was like trying to jungle and just like running it down
[1877.86s -> 1880.86s]  it was I don't even know it was the weirdest game that I've played in a while
[1882.86s -> 1885.86s]  because like my 80 carry wasn't bad
[1885.86s -> 1890.86s]  like this guy is clearly like honest Murphy but I don't know how good he was because he wasn't bad at the game
[1891.86s -> 1893.86s]  the enemy 80 carry wasn't bad
[1893.86s -> 1896.86s]  This guy's also on a smurf.
[1896.86s -> 1898.86s]  It was the weirdest lobby.
[1898.86s -> 1900.86s]  It was like a bunch of smurf accounts.
[1900.86s -> 1908.09s]  All playing with each other, but it was like a non smurf queue.
[1908.09s -> 1910.09s]  This guy was like the only non smurf.
[1910.09s -> 1922.97s]  It was interesting.
[1922.97s -> 1923.97s]  Ooh, do I take ghost here?
[1923.97s -> 1924.97s]  Or do I just...
[1924.97s -> 1929.97s]  I think ghost could be really OP versus their team with Cassiopea,
[1929.97s -> 1930.97s]  but maybe I should just take...
[1930.97s -> 1940.04s]  I'm gonna try it.
[1940.04s -> 1943.54s]  I don't know. Somebody dodged.
[1943.54s -> 1946.74s]  Because yeah, I don't know. I never know. I don't remember what you think Ghost Ignite, whatever.
[1948.74s -> 1952.66s]  Because I feel Ghost with Casios feels like the same exact Ecarot, right? Same idea.
[1953.30s -> 1966.76s]  Where it feels really OP. Dude, there's so much drama going on in the lead community yet again.
[1967.48s -> 2006.78s]  By the way, it's, it's insane. Yeah, I don't know, man. I, I just, I'm, I like, I like looking at drama
[2006.78s -> 2016.76s]  because like drama is juicy like I like looking at drama, but it's also like how are people so stupid?
[2033.62s -> 2035.62s]  Yeah, I'm getting like I
[2036.18s -> 2043.78s]  I don't know man my view on all of this shit is like I guess I'm just not hardwired that way
[2043.78s -> 2051.22s]  I can't mentally wrap my head around being like excited the fort with underage girls or like when like
[2051.86s -> 2057.48s]  I just I've never like had the want
[2057.48s -> 2067.39s]  But it happens so much between the League Streamers and non-Leges.
[2067.39s -> 2068.39s]  It's not even a League thing.
[2068.39s -> 2069.39s]  It's just that we're in the League community, right?
[2069.39s -> 2070.39s]  So you see it more.
[2070.39s -> 2076.39s]  Dude, the drama is like a decent-sized League Streamer,
[2076.39s -> 2079.39s]  who is like getting bigger, whatever, like the 80-carry streamer,
[2079.39s -> 2081.39s]  cookie, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2081.39s -> 2089.39s]  He was like, somebody made a 90-page, 90 pages of Google Docs.
[2089.39s -> 2094.40s]  To basically like expose this guy for like
[2095.12s -> 2097.60s]  Talking a bunch like sexually to underage girls
[2098.16s -> 2103.72s]  Not paying as fucking like mods who do work for him and like other stuff and I'm like there
[2111.76s -> 2118.24s]  How man like just be a normal human
[2118.64s -> 2125.40s]  It's not that bad like I take it for me being a normal dude. It's not that bad
[2200.21s -> 2202.45s]  Sorry, I was distracted. No, I
[2202.45s -> 2208.17s]  Yeah, I don't know man. I swear to God people are just stupid as fuck people are idiots
[2210.13s -> 2215.57s]  There's gotta be some psychological underline issue with people's brains not working, but it is what it is
[2218.90s -> 2221.30s]  Huh, I found this book I look out for a while
[2225.14s -> 2231.09s]  Dude, what is that tarry skin?
[2231.49s -> 2237.46s]  To see this we just tarry skin, man. He's fabulous
[2238.54s -> 2240.54s]  God there
[2240.74s -> 2243.14s]  My man, it's just straight of fabulous.
[2243.14s -> 2257.72s]  People are desperate.
[2258.72s -> 2260.38s]  I just can't, I don't think,
[2260.38s -> 2263.22s]  I've been in the situation where I was like a really,
[2263.22s -> 2266.22s]  really big streamer, much bigger than he is.
[2266.22s -> 2270.02s]  And I got, this is what I'm saying is I understand.
[2272.02s -> 2274.54s]  Like, all of the crap that gets thrown at you,
[2274.54s -> 2277.06s]  like people will literally message you for no reason.
[2277.06s -> 2280.02s]  Like you do have fans that have,
[2280.02s -> 2281.62s]  like, when I was at my biggest point,
[2281.62s -> 2284.26s]  like you have fans that are younger.
[2284.26s -> 2286.10s]  Girls guy, it doesn't matter.
[2286.10s -> 2287.42s]  And like you just gotta like,
[2287.42s -> 2289.54s]  I just never in my mind I guess thought like,
[2289.54s -> 2290.82s]  oh, I'm gonna flirt with these people.
[2290.82s -> 2292.90s]  Like it made me like,
[2292.90s -> 2294.26s]  I don't even, I wouldn't even,
[2294.26s -> 2302.93s]  I literally didn't even see them as like sexual in my brain.
[2302.93s -> 2307.32s]  Like it blows my mind.
[2307.32s -> 2309.04s]  And then the fact that like,
[2309.04s -> 2312.36s]  if you look at the Google Doc or whatever,
[2312.36s -> 2314.08s]  the fact that like talk,
[2314.08s -> 2315.16s]  like I keep a talk or whatever,
[2315.16s -> 2316.92s]  was literally talking to him,
[2316.92s -> 2320.12s]  Telling him he was doing it like what he was doing was wrong. He was like, yeah, I get it, right?
[2320.72s -> 2333.06s]  Then he did it again
[2333.06s -> 2336.26s]  Dude the set-alting the pussy that
[2337.50s -> 2340.34s]  I'll be on it that maybe one of the funny lines I've ever heard
[2355.06s -> 2360.38s]  Like dude, I mean whatever, you know, I'm not here to kink shame whatever gets people off, you know, maybe maybe
[2360.90s -> 2362.90s]  That's a fetish. I don't know
[2392.65s -> 2394.53s]  One, one, one, one, one, one!
[2394.53s -> 2396.95s]  One, one, I'm safe and sound.
[2399.30s -> 2400.12s]  Either way!
[2401.40s -> 2403.26s]  Don't worry, we can not talk about the drama real quick.
[2404.18s -> 2405.64s]  We can talk about, uh...
[2407.18s -> 2409.50s]  How old and washed up wings to death is, though.
[2426.65s -> 2427.51s]  I'm kidding.
[2432.71s -> 2435.15s]  Yo, did you see it on a wider note though? Do you see Riot?
[2436.17s -> 2442.49s]  There was like a Reddit thread, or something, where Riot was saying that they were like gonna try and do something about smurfing in the next few months?
[2444.61s -> 2445.99s]  I don't know what that means!
[2447.29s -> 2463.65s]  But he's always something involving wings just between us. Yeah, just between us and all the homies. Yeah, and chat. Yeah, nobody else anything. It's fine. Yeah, no
[2467.22s -> 2503.46s]  What's up? My chat ain't snitches. When I was a teen, I made a montage of him having breakdowns in my games. Oh my god
[2504.22s -> 2519.34s]  That's amazing. Oh my god. That's amazing. I feel like I need to pay you to see this montage. Like I will give you money
[2519.34s -> 2548.29s]  I need this this is important to me. Oh, I have a dude. You should see the I have so many rage
[2548.29s -> 2565.55s]  compilations about me. It's crazy. So many. I had a I had a a Velonark for sure. I feel
[2565.55s -> 2575.92s]  you just comes with like being a league streamer. League players are not all mentally healthy.
[2575.92s -> 2592.05s]  Let me let me tell you. Thank you for me. Add okay. I'd like to think I'm not a villain anymore.
[2592.05s -> 2624.98s]  Fuck you. I really want this play it. Nice dude. Maybe he is roaming. Why is there a
[2624.98s -> 2637.85s]  Woocon just sitting top by the way? That's actually hilarious. You know what's interesting?
[2637.85s -> 2648.74s]  I feel like Terric actually missed that stun. I was kind of side-eyeing that but I feel like
[2648.74s -> 2674.06s]  he missed that stun somehow. I feel like this is the easiest game I've ever played by the
[2674.06s -> 2681.02s]  I'm on full autopilot rain still waking up and I feel like they're just walking into me on repeat
[2681.02s -> 2683.90s]  I'm just killing them all. I don't even know what the fuck's going on
[2685.66s -> 2689.98s]  My day it feels like the enemy team has not like they didn't they didn't like understand
[2689.98s -> 2693.66s]  We were playing league right like they queued up and they were like oh, yeah, this is league
[2695.10s -> 2697.10s]  That's what this feels like
[2697.82s -> 2701.66s]  This is what I imagine if I mic Tyson went into a preschool, you know, and I mean like this is what this feels like
[2701.66s -> 2738.46s]  I probably could have killed those guys, but I don't want to have a chill.
[2738.46s -> 2762.31s]  I'm assuming the wolf on is gonna come bot soon. There he is.
[2762.31s -> 2766.31s]  Damn it, I quence late. I actually killed Bull.
[2766.31s -> 2769.31s]  That's a late quence by me.
[2769.31s -> 2774.31s]  I don't want to take the risk of coming back up.
[2774.31s -> 2777.31s]  She stuns me, they can one shot me.
[2777.31s -> 2779.31s]  I should have killed the fucking guy though
[2780.95s -> 2785.27s]  The Wukong I just backed up too far and then I coined the son for not like really late
[2794.88s -> 2802.00s]  I just it was a man so boys good evening good evening good morning. I don't know where the fuck you guys live so good day
[2815.11s -> 2825.91s]  Fuck about watching
[2825.91s -> 2827.91s]  Wait that Wukong lived
[2832.88s -> 2837.26s]  Whoa, bro. Oh, I'm dead
[2839.22s -> 2841.22s]  Dude that wall was BS
[2843.06s -> 2847.38s]  There was like a little hole and then I flashed the light because I was like, oh, I could walk out the hole
[2847.78s -> 2852.98s]  But I couldn't walk out the tiny little hole. I'm not a buckers
[2854.22s -> 2862.65s]  I shouldn't have even been there, but like I'm stupid. I should have just pushed bot
[2862.65s -> 2866.41s]  I was like dude, that's such a bad fight, but I walked over to those like I'm really thin
[2867.53s -> 2870.77s]  Honestly, I probably could have killed them if I didn't if I had like flashed the
[2872.05s -> 2876.80s]  It's done any stunts the only
[2876.80s -> 2881.80s]  Like, most over, like, I swear if they reduced Andy's done by like,
[2881.80s -> 2884.80s]  point five seconds, she would never get played.
[2884.80s -> 2889.80s]  Like, actually the only reason to play Annie is that her stun is just so
[2889.80s -> 2894.80s]  OP, because it's like, it's like the reason they changed Terrix a long ago,
[2894.80s -> 2902.46s]  where like, when you have a point click, CC, it's typically really broken.
[2902.46s -> 2913.30s]  Okay, I'm just dead.
[2913.30s -> 2943.06s]  There's Terric not have old leveled up at six. He didn't level his ulti. Maybe it's maybe Terric old sucks.
[2943.06s -> 2948.37s]  Maybe it's under power. You know?
[2948.37s -> 2950.37s]  Now yeah, he must have missed quick.
[2950.37s -> 2962.78s]  Honestly, I'm just breathing. I'm like playing too aggro for like.
[2962.78s -> 2967.78s]  Like I threw my lead because I was like, oh shit, I'm going to walk over and help the homies.
[2967.78s -> 2970.78s]  You never walk over and help the homies when the homies are getting shit on because
[2970.78s -> 2972.78s]  because uh...
[2972.78s -> 2975.34s]  if you have like nine hundred gold or a thousand gold but you'd like it like
[2975.34s -> 2978.14s]  i'd enter whatever you don't want to do that's because
[2978.14s -> 2979.34s]  you'll give
[2979.34s -> 2983.76s]  mf at ton of kills
[2983.76s -> 2994.46s]  we're in a good spot now though
[2994.46s -> 2996.62s]  but i am still a little
[2996.62s -> 3000.93s]  wait terrac-oh we've all the salt matters
[3000.93s -> 3005.55s]  this terrac just not know how to play terrac by the way
[3005.55s -> 3011.23s]  he's thrown out his stone so awkwardly
[3011.23s -> 3018.59s]  that's okay though i mean i apparently don't know how to play dragon so
[3018.59s -> 3025.23s]  I can't really believe in the guy.
[3025.23s -> 3031.61s]  I mean, you guys are doing dragon with no smite.
[3031.61s -> 3045.01s]  But it seems like doing dragon with no smite.
[3045.01s -> 3052.56s]  I mean, we could fight these fights, but it's like painful.
[3052.56s -> 3056.27s]  We could easily fight these fights.
[3056.27s -> 3058.59s]  I think a lot of it is just like,
[3058.59s -> 3061.67s]  Tarrick isn't confident enough to walk up and stun.
[3061.67s -> 3063.87s]  That's what I'm seeing the issue is.
[3063.87s -> 3065.87s]  He's doing the thing where he's not,
[3065.87s -> 3067.39s]  he doesn't have the confidence to actually walk up
[3067.39s -> 3072.05s]  since he's a melee champ.
[3072.05s -> 3075.53s]  So he's walking up in like taking half his health.
[3075.53s -> 3077.81s]  And it's making him nervous.
[3077.81s -> 3082.81s]  It happens a lot with players who are very melee champ centric.
[3084.33s -> 3085.97s]  Because melee supports are actually pretty risky.
[3085.97s -> 3097.90s]  Are they pretty scary, rather?
[3097.90s -> 3099.18s]  Oh, he's totally dead.
[3099.18s -> 3100.58s]  Oh, no, we're not.
[3100.58s -> 3103.06s]  But yeah, melee supports are scary to play
[3103.06s -> 3106.98s]  because you have to know when you can get a kill by going in
[3106.98s -> 3110.26s]  because you're going to take damage, right?
[3110.26s -> 3116.99s]  That's just like the nature of melee supports.
[3116.99s -> 3117.83s]  Nice.
[3118.83s -> 3121.47s]  We're coming back in a bit, not bad.
[3121.47s -> 3124.27s]  We threw a little bit early, but yeah, we're starting to get it back.
[3124.27s -> 3127.58s]  We're chill.
[3127.58s -> 3129.06s]  Tanks are never gonna.
[3129.06s -> 3132.18s]  I'm always confused by Terric because he feels like
[3132.18s -> 3135.22s]  such a good champion, like the champion itself feels broken
[3135.22s -> 3136.06s]  as shit.
[3137.86s -> 3140.66s]  Like whatever I see, Terric, I think to myself like,
[3140.66s -> 3145.66s]  the
[3145.66s -> 3147.66s]  he's either uncaly like super OP or
[3147.66s -> 3149.66s]  they're like
[3149.66s -> 3151.66s]  oh and 10
[3151.66s -> 3155.66s]  there's no in between right like they either know how to play terracare they know is what it feels like
[3155.66s -> 3174.32s]  oh you're I mean yeah you're wrong terracare actually requires mechanics
[3174.32s -> 3177.32s]  that's actually true
[3177.32s -> 3181.24s]  supports like not of us doesn't have mechanics you know and like what's correct
[3181.24s -> 3185.40s]  doesn't have mechanics they just hit their button and if it if it works they they
[3185.40s -> 3190.92s]  get a kill or it's like taric after you stun there is like stuff you have to do
[3190.92s -> 3219.35s]  that doesn't make sense or block do you think um oh I'm gonna die oh thank god do you
[3219.35s -> 3225.99s]  think taric's one of the harder supports I think he's pretty hard but I don't think
[3225.99s -> 3232.99s]  He's, well, I mean, he's harder than the other supports, like, I think like, I don't think there's a single support that's hard.
[3232.99s -> 3241.35s]  I know, I'm, I'm toxic for that, but I stand by it.
[3241.35s -> 3258.76s]  Oh, I mean, I'm just gonna die. I'm not gonna turn flash.
[3258.76s -> 3263.76s]  I don't think I should have just flashed over, but I kind of got baited by the terracult.
[3263.76s -> 3267.76s]  I wanted to see if I could fight, but there's too much to see.
[3267.76s -> 3272.14s]  I was like, oh, he's holding me. Let's go.
[3272.14s -> 3275.90s]  I can tell this is a really low-Elo game because there's so much random deaths.
[3275.90s -> 3279.10s]  Like, I'm following victim to like, I'm auto-pivoting.
[3279.10s -> 3283.54s]  And like, I'm not thinking, and I'm just talking to you guys, and I'm just dying for free.
[3283.54s -> 3287.70s]  But it's like, there's so many people who's dying for free. It's hilarious.
[3287.70s -> 3290.38s]  Thresh? Thresh isn't actually that farmed.
[3290.38s -> 3295.70s]  So, like, a lot of people think like, the rush mechanically is very difficult,
[3295.70s -> 3300.02s]  because he is harder than the other supports, but he's not actually that hard.
[3300.02s -> 3308.66s]  He's like, once you learn the thrash combos, he's pretty much a very upfront champion.
[3308.66s -> 3321.52s]  Yeah, like, like Lantern, for example, is one of the most broken things to ever be put
[3321.52s -> 3324.36s]  in league and everybody fucks it up.
[3324.36s -> 3328.36s]  Like people will just mess up Lantern because they'll throw it for souls or they'll mess up.
[3328.36s -> 3335.40s]  Like, you can literally just hold Lantern perma and your AD carry can walk up, auto the
[3335.40s -> 3348.52s]  And you literally like they literally can't play the game after that. Like the enemy team I mean because like there's nothing they can do to stop it
[3349.08s -> 3352.46s]  We can totally fight this by the way
[3353.36s -> 3358.68s]  So I got done that before we're like my thrash where I know I have a good throw hold on me when this team fight really quick
[3360.44s -> 3384.30s]  Give me second
[3384.30s -> 3389.98s]  Okay, so I had the one that team power part. Okay, so as I was saying there's a lot more to thrash than
[3391.18s -> 3393.18s]  People think right
[3393.18s -> 3398.18s]  It's essentially people over-complicate like what he needs to do so it's like
[3398.18s -> 3402.98s]  Thresh is a very basic like when you see Thresh in pro play you you don't ever see like what you do
[3402.98s -> 3404.98s]  But it's very rare that you see like sick
[3404.98s -> 3410.38s]  Permal-hooking like oh my god like it's mainly like they pick him for like lantern
[3411.38s -> 3414.58s]  It's right up like when they pick Thresh and hi-lo
[3414.58s -> 3422.38s]  He's not picked to be the god tier like always landing permacese hooks like play god like he's picked to like shut down and gauge and
[3423.18s -> 3425.78s]  uh... remove
[3425.78s -> 3431.04s]  kill threat to your carries that's always picked for
[3431.04s -> 3435.19s]  but he's literally just an e-dw one
[3435.19s -> 3438.63s]  armor stacking i mean yeah the armor thing on thresh is nice but it's i wouldn't
[3438.63s -> 3442.77s]  say it's like opionus kit
[3442.77s -> 3450.22s]  it just makes him like not died to eighty carries in two seconds
[3450.22s -> 3453.78s]  what is happening
[3453.78s -> 3457.62s]  but i instantly know on point with a good thrash player when i can walk up to the
[3457.62s -> 3461.80s]  turret
[3461.80s -> 3475.92s]  uh... when i can walk up to the turret and the threat
[3475.92s -> 3481.38s]  I was trying to think and talk at the same time when I go walk up to the turret my thrash player won't walk up and out of the turret with me
[3481.38s -> 3483.38s]  That's like the sign of a good thrash player
[3483.94s -> 3487.98s]  When we don't know where the enemy is and instead of walking up and trying to hit the turret
[3487.98s -> 3493.70s]  I like help you kill the turret. They'll stand in the back and literally just sit there and wait and hold lantern until
[3496.82s -> 3498.82s]  They just hold their lantern until like you can
[3499.74s -> 3501.74s]  Into a gigant essentially
[3504.51s -> 3508.81s]  And that's why I I just personally don't think the rush is mechanics. There's hardest people think
[3508.81s -> 3513.45s]  I do think he's he's very knowledge based like I think Russia has high knowledge caps
[3514.09s -> 3519.73s]  Where like if you're playing I don't know like Lulu your skill is basically like do I
[3519.73s -> 3527.41s]  W your decision make on Lulu is literally do I W to speed or do I W to CC right like that's your that's your decision making
[3527.61s -> 3529.61s]  So it's like obviously much higher than that
[3530.73s -> 3532.73s]  But it's a
[3534.33s -> 3536.17s]  You've son of a bitch
[3536.17s -> 3538.17s]  But it's still not like that bad
[3538.17s -> 3545.93s]  I think Thresh just intimidates people because he can do so much and so I think people just get
[3545.93s -> 3554.56s]  intimidated but because they think it looks overwhelming to learn the champ. I feel like that
[3554.56s -> 3560.16s]  actually intimidates a lot of people in terms of like people not wanting to learn new champions
[3560.16s -> 3568.24s]  chips. I feel like a lot of it is just people are nervous about learning champions that look
[3568.24s -> 3570.36s]  overwhelming, right?
[3570.36s -> 3574.98s]  Like a failure, for example, I was talking about this yesterday.
[3574.98s -> 3582.28s]  A failure is not a hard mechanical champion, like he's difficult in terms of the knowledge
[3582.28s -> 3586.36s]  required, like he's knowledge-gated, very hard, right?
[3586.36s -> 3591.24s]  So you have to play him a decent amount or like research him to understand what guns
[3591.24s -> 3594.80s]  do what, how to interact with the guns, stuff like that, right?
[3594.80s -> 3599.80s]  But the actual mechanics of using the guns, it's actually not hard.
[3599.80s -> 3601.80s]  Guys, what are we doing?
[3601.80s -> 3619.33s]  I guess we're just winning the fight.
[3619.33s -> 3621.77s]  Pike?
[3621.77s -> 3623.77s]  Like, I think Pike's harder than Thresh.
[3623.77s -> 3631.48s]  Maybe that's a hot take, but I think Pike is harder than Thresh.
[3631.48s -> 3637.18s]  Because Pike requires like really specific.
[3637.18s -> 3644.18s]  Pike is a lot harder to play than he looks when you see people play him.
[3644.18s -> 3649.78s]  Because there's like timers of when you can go in off of certain things like hitting his
[3649.78s -> 3655.06s]  old team consistently and team fights is a little harder than people think and knowing how to
[3655.06s -> 3661.14s]  position in the lane like pikus capable of a lot more than people think. So I think pikus, I think
[3661.14s -> 3669.89s]  the reason the main reason I think pikus a little harder is because he's made way. Like melee champions
[3669.89s -> 3675.49s]  are always going to be like mechanically more difficult than ranged. If the melee champion is like
[3675.49s -> 3682.74s]  you have to engage to go in and do stuff because there's always the counter
[3682.74s -> 3692.62s]  by factor support role. Yeah, that's what I'm saying is like I'm not saying
[3692.62s -> 3695.94s]  overall like overall range champions require a lot more mechanics than
[3695.94s -> 3699.68s]  melee just because you're ranged you can die in a global and you have to space
[3699.68s -> 3704.48s]  and stuff but I think that like in just the support support support specific I
[3704.48s -> 3708.64s]  think melee is a lot harder to play that's why you see a lot of like support
[3708.64s -> 3712.88s]  players we give like the best support players in the world are really good at
[3712.88s -> 3715.92s]  like the engaged melee supports, not the like in chanters.
[3715.92s -> 3718.88s]  And that's why you see like why we praise the best
[3718.88s -> 3723.02s]  support players because like when you see somebody
[3723.02s -> 3726.94s]  going like perfectly on Rakan or going like find a way
[3726.94s -> 3731.44s]  and without getting knocked up on like, I don't know,
[3732.56s -> 3735.52s]  something like when they find the angle on thrash
[3735.52s -> 3748.22s]  and she's it's really nice, real.
[3749.10s -> 3752.22s]  I think real sucks. I think that champ is so bad
[3752.22s -> 3760.96s]  because she just like, she doesn't do anything.
[3760.96s -> 3763.96s]  Like, Rels, Rels' initial thing was like,
[3763.96s -> 3766.96s]  she was supposed to go in, be really tanky,
[3766.96s -> 3768.96s]  and then be like a stun bot for like team fights.
[3768.96s -> 3770.96s]  She was a team fight monster.
[3770.96s -> 3772.96s]  But the problem with Rels is like,
[3772.96s -> 3775.96s]  she has one chance essentially in lane phase.
[3775.96s -> 3777.96s]  Like if anybody has fingers on their hands,
[3777.96s -> 3779.96s]  and they can move left and right,
[3779.96s -> 3781.96s]  Rels really easy to dodge.
[3781.96s -> 3784.96s]  Like it's incredibly easy to beat a Rel in lane.
[3784.96s -> 3787.24s]  and to not die to her.
[3787.24s -> 3789.40s]  Well, you just have to move less than right, right?
[3789.40s -> 3790.88s]  It's very simple.
[3790.88s -> 3796.72s]  So it's much more difficult to dodge like
[3796.72s -> 3798.36s]  other engaged champs if that makes sense.
[3798.36s -> 3800.16s]  Like, not a less, you can still move left and right,
[3800.16s -> 3802.76s]  but it's like, he can walk at you while it's happening.
[3802.76s -> 3804.72s]  Whereas like, if we're out, walks at you,
[3804.72s -> 3807.80s]  I'm still like just waiting for the animation
[3807.80s -> 3810.44s]  and then I can simply move to the left
[3810.44s -> 3814.76s]  because like her animation is so slow on using her ability
[3814.76s -> 3817.16s]  that I can like dash, I can flash, I can,
[3817.16s -> 3823.32s]  There's so much counterplay and it's like unless she flashes on you, but even then you can tell she's going to flash on you. So it's like
[3824.76s -> 3832.60s]  I also feel like mid game Relle has this issue where she has her one trick ulti engage fight in team fights,
[3832.60s -> 3843.12s]  but after she does that she does literally nothing, right? She's like a one and done. That's why like she feels like she doesn't have other
[3843.12s -> 3855.12s]  expression. She's countered so hard by the meta too. Millio counters
[3855.12s -> 3861.40s]  running gauge. Thresh counters rather than gauge. Right. Like, either either of
[3861.40s -> 3876.28s]  those champions shuts on running gauge and you can't do anything. Like, I don't
[3876.28s -> 3880.24s]  know if you've ever tried to play Rell gone in and been like, Thresh
[3880.24s -> 3888.72s]  flayed, but it's the worst feeling. It's a bad feeling. It's like when people
[3888.72s -> 3894.80s]  play Leonets the same reason Leonets shit right now. Like they both have the same idea of why they're bad, right?
[3896.16s -> 3900.32s]  They like have they're both good at doing what they're supposed to do. Like, you know,
[3900.32s -> 3903.68s]  stone and create pressure and point click and shit. But the problem is is like,
[3905.68s -> 3910.56s]  you can easily counterpeck them so incredibly hard that they just become worthless the whole game.
[3914.81s -> 3919.13s]  We've ever gotten sent a secondary mission all the time. With Senate being like with
[3919.13s -> 3927.45s]  thrash being meta and set up being like a champion on playing a lot. I get that all the time. You don't even notice it though. I'm gonna be real
[3928.89s -> 3934.01s]  When you kill the thrash or whatever and you get these souls, you don't even fucking notice it because like it's like 40 armor
[3937.93s -> 3940.73s]  And it's like your level 17 or some shit at that point
[3941.77s -> 3947.33s]  Like at the point you're getting it you're such a high level that like the 40 random armor like it's nice
[3947.33s -> 3956.02s]  But I never really notice it
[3956.02s -> 3958.30s]  point to get a teammates ahead isn't that good?
[3958.30s -> 3962.46s]  You don't have actually been doing as support on my main account.
[3962.46s -> 3974.77s]  I've actually been roaming non-stop and it's super OP.
[3974.77s -> 3979.89s]  Because the key to roaming is all you have to do to roam well
[3979.89s -> 3985.05s]  is literally be there one or two times in the first five minutes of the game
[3985.05s -> 3990.13s]  to completely fuck over the enemy one time on an engage or something
[3990.13s -> 3994.41s]  And they get so far behind from it that you can literally just walk back about
[3998.16s -> 4009.08s]  Like I do on senate like I'll push bot lane. This is my strategy and senate. I'm gonna give it to you guys. Okay, so I don't know I don't know if this works in low a low, but in like masters like high masters. This works at least
[4010.64s -> 4019.44s]  This is all I do in senate every single player I play against on senate every single one except for like pike players even not of us, but they they all can see the lane level one
[4020.04s -> 4023.08s]  Every single one of them right they just they just let me push level one
[4023.36s -> 4032.96s]  And so I'll push the waves in level one and I'll either crash wave two or wave three depending on how far they're giving me like push power, right?
[4032.96s -> 4037.92s]  So I will always crash wave two or wave three bot and I will immediately
[4038.92s -> 4039.92s]  Roman
[4040.92s -> 4041.92s]  every time
[4042.92s -> 4043.92s]  and
[4044.56s -> 4046.40s]  even if I don't get a kill
[4046.80s -> 4052.40s]  usually it fucks over the enemy mid laner so badly because on that exact timer
[4052.40s -> 4060.06s]  There's usually a gang happening on men.
[4060.06s -> 4063.56s]  So, a lot of the time people think that you're roaming
[4063.56s -> 4066.22s]  to get a kill for the winner, you're not.
[4066.22s -> 4070.54s]  You're roaming to counter pressure from the other players
[4070.54s -> 4073.57s]  in the game.
[4073.57s -> 4075.01s]  How many times have you guys been like,
[4075.01s -> 4077.93s]  oh, we can win this 2v2, you see the enemy jungler,
[4077.93s -> 4080.13s]  your jungler comes, you're like, oh, we're going to bait this.
[4080.13s -> 4081.65s]  And then all of a sudden the support shows up
[4081.65s -> 4083.33s]  and you're like, God dammit.
[4083.33s -> 4085.81s]  And then you die, and you're like, what the fuck?
[4085.81s -> 4088.77s]  That right there is how easy it is to play support,
[4088.77s -> 4093.77s]  because all you have to do is show up once, twice,
[4093.77s -> 4095.69s]  and now that entire of my aim is fucked
[4095.69s -> 4102.28s]  for the enemy team.
[4102.28s -> 4104.04s]  Rome is so easy.
[4104.04s -> 4106.76s]  The only thing, people fuck up roaming really bad
[4106.76s -> 4109.52s]  when they roam on timers where they're 80 carry
[4109.52s -> 4111.36s]  can't safely farm.
[4111.36s -> 4113.72s]  So what ends up happening is on that timer, right?
[4113.72s -> 4116.32s]  Where I'm like, I told you way of two, three, right?
[4116.32s -> 4119.56s]  What happens is you push that wave in, you roam in.
[4119.56s -> 4121.16s]  Let's say nothing happens, okay?
[4121.16s -> 4123.32s]  I can just walk back a bot.
[4123.32s -> 4125.12s]  It's, you lose nothing.
[4125.12s -> 4126.36s]  And if usually at that point,
[4126.36s -> 4127.84s]  you have like three-and-a-gold,
[4127.84s -> 4129.44s]  so there's no point in backing, right?
[4129.44s -> 4130.60s]  Now, let's say like,
[4130.60s -> 4134.28s]  I noticed that my jungler is like invading topside.
[4134.28s -> 4136.28s]  I just walk over to top and help him.
[4137.56s -> 4142.00s]  Because you have like three to four waves
[4142.00s -> 4143.76s]  before the enemy bot lane,
[4143.76s -> 4150.80s]  the enemy bot lane has to play it almost perfectly
[4150.80s -> 4154.48s]  to be able to abuse your room on certain timers.
[4155.88s -> 4158.80s]  They essentially have to put it perfect to abuse the room.
[4158.80s -> 4160.52s]  What I mean by that is like,
[4160.52s -> 4164.16s]  the best way to abuse a support roaming is you either A.
[4165.16s -> 4166.76s]  If you have the ability to dive,
[4166.76s -> 4168.20s]  you can pretty much A,
[4169.88s -> 4172.08s]  immediately dive, like push the next wave
[4172.08s -> 4173.24s]  and then immediately dive
[4173.24s -> 4174.84s]  if you have that ability to say a point
[4174.84s -> 4176.32s]  when we own a driver or something.
[4176.32s -> 4178.20s]  But even then, it's a little risky
[4178.20s -> 4180.16s]  because then the 80 carry can just walk back
[4180.16s -> 4183.92s]  and then we lose one wave and you gave up a stack chance.
[4183.92s -> 4185.20s]  So it's not that bad.
[4185.20s -> 4188.48s]  Two, you can stack the wave.
[4188.48s -> 4191.68s]  Now, stacking the wave is the best way to counter it.
[4191.68s -> 4194.28s]  Because let's say I'm roaming for an extended period.
[4194.28s -> 4196.00s]  You stack like a three wave,
[4196.00s -> 4197.44s]  and then all of a sudden you're crashing it.
[4197.44s -> 4199.12s]  And then you want up a level
[4199.12s -> 4200.40s]  because you've been gaining XP
[4200.40s -> 4202.24s]  and the 80 carry has to back off.
[4202.24s -> 4205.72s]  But the way to counter that is you simply just walk back
[4205.72s -> 4207.76s]  on the timer of the stacked wave crashing
[4207.76s -> 4209.68s]  as an 80 carry, or as a support.
[4209.68s -> 4211.68s]  It's so incredibly easy to do.
[4211.68s -> 4214.52s]  It's actually brainlessly easy to do.
[4214.52s -> 4218.44s]  Like, it's literally, you can roam all you want,
[4218.44s -> 4221.16s]  bot lane, as long as you are in bot lane
[4221.16s -> 4224.04s]  for the stacked wave crashes or you are in bot lane
[4224.04s -> 4230.87s]  when your jungler is bot side of the map.
[4230.87s -> 4234.09s]  It's easiest fuck.
[4234.09s -> 4236.97s]  But support players, drooling themselves.
[4236.97s -> 4238.89s]  So they like to essentially
[4240.21s -> 4243.49s]  support players like to like AFK in the lane phase.
[4243.49s -> 4245.33s]  They like to literally sit there
[4245.33s -> 4246.33s]  and just do nothing.
[4248.17s -> 4251.97s]  That's like the average support I see is they will stand and do nothing.
[4254.84s -> 4259.40s]  And and I've said this before, but I'll say it again, being a good support is not being a better player than enemy team.
[4259.80s -> 4262.40s]  Being a good support is queuing up to play League of Legends.
[4264.04s -> 4269.32s]  That's that's all it takes. All it takes to be a good support is queuing up with the intent to push buttons in the game.
[4270.60s -> 4271.48s]  And not just AFK.
[4498.64s -> 4500.04s]  All right, I'm back.
[4500.04s -> 4502.04s]  What's up?
[4502.04s -> 4511.51s]  I don't remember we're talking about all supports yeah they're all stupid.
[4511.51s -> 4515.91s]  Don't af can't support you'll gain LP it's that it's actually that easy.
[4515.91s -> 4532.99s]  I want to say I don't think supports a stupid I think it's more of a how do I phrase this
[4532.99s -> 4539.56s]  it's in my opinion it's more of like they're like they've never they don't have to
[4539.56s -> 4545.39s]  learn.
[4545.39s -> 4550.23s]  Support players like don't have to learn important things because they can get away with
[4550.23s -> 4562.63s]  Not doing it, so they develop bad habits that's oldest.
[4562.63s -> 4564.63s]  Do I have a Spotify playlist?
[4564.63s -> 4569.60s]  Yeah.
[4569.60s -> 4571.76s]  Best role to climb.
[4571.76s -> 4573.76s]  I think every role is good to climb.
[4573.76s -> 4575.20s]  As long as you're good.
[4575.20s -> 4576.48s]  Classic Jarrett, oh I don't see.
[4577.52s -> 4579.52s]  Whatever you linked, I don't know about links in the chat
[4579.52s -> 4581.36s]  because I had to turn them off a long time ago.
[4582.88s -> 4590.18s]  So I can't see this.
[4590.18s -> 4592.90s]  I would say climbing is just about like whatever,
[4592.90s -> 4595.86s]  because every role you can climb on, right? Like every single role.
[4595.86s -> 4607.44s]  So climbing a lot of the time is just about what you think is most fun for you and you can get the best at.
[4607.44s -> 4617.44s]  I would say objectively, the best roles to climb on are jungle and support for just like higher e-vote.
[4617.44s -> 4621.44s]  Well, jungle and lower e-vote support and higher e-vote.
[4621.44s -> 4629.44s]  I wouldn't climb on support in like gold because you're not going to have a good time trying to like help bad players play the game.
[4629.44s -> 4636.00s]  Bad, it's mean people who don't like you can get it like a gold as real 30 kills by being the better support
[4636.24s -> 4645.12s]  But you won't always win whereas like if you really want to control solo queue and your teammates aren't like good enough to carry at that level by themselves
[4645.12s -> 4650.88s]  Right, like you get frustrated just pick something that has more agency in the game
[4658.92s -> 4665.20s]  You lost 18 or 24 as jungle you want to turn you roll. I mean you could play it. He it's if you think it's it
[4665.20s -> 4679.40s]  it carries interesting. I wouldn't say it's like fun, but it's not, it's not bad. You're in gold.
[4679.40s -> 4684.52s]  I mean, you could try it. My view on it is if people were wondering if they want to play a role or not,
[4685.16s -> 4688.12s]  my view is just try it. See if you like it because if you don't like the role,
[4688.12s -> 4691.08s]  you're not going to be able to put in enough games to get good at the role, right? So like,
[4692.28s -> 4696.60s]  just give it a try. See if you enjoy it or not. And if it's not fun, then if it's not your
[4696.60s -> 4701.88s]  Playstyle, it's not fun because 80s are very unique playstyle from all the other rules.
[4701.88s -> 4709.48s]  Like, the reason people don't like playing 80 carry and like watching 80 carry streamers
[4709.48s -> 4720.23s]  in ship is because 80 carry is like, it's boring, 80 carry is like zero, like, like,
[4720.23s -> 4723.55s]  there was a graph of shit going on when you're playing 80 carry in the game, it's like
[4723.55s -> 4724.55s]  this.
[4724.55s -> 4728.67s]  There's like spikes to 100 and then it's back to like this, right?
[4728.67s -> 4737.00s]  It's like, Eddie Carrey is a lot of every game is different, right?
[4737.00s -> 4743.80s]  Every game when you play 80s different, because you're always with a different player,
[4743.80s -> 4745.76s]  like a different support unless you do okay.
[4745.76s -> 4751.48s]  So every Eddie Carrey's game's difference, coupled with, you spend a lot of the game
[4751.48s -> 4755.12s]  just farming, but you don't get to interact with the enemy a lot.
[4755.12s -> 4760.64s]  So you just kind of farm a lot of the game and even then, you also like, you've
[4760.64s -> 4765.64s]  Basically, they're farming for like little dopamine hits of like team fights and stuff that you get around the game, so that's kind of fun.
[4765.64s -> 4771.36s]  But it's, like I said, it's all you. You can climb on any roll.
[4771.36s -> 4781.36s]  I think 80 carry requires the most mechanical skill to climb because the difference between the climbing is like a jungler is about being in the right spot at the right time, right?
[4781.36s -> 4784.36s]  Like you need to path this way, get objectives, et cetera.
[4784.36s -> 4789.36s]  Climbing is an 80 carry is more about like this person fucked up their positioning. I'm gonna kill them.
[4789.36s -> 4823.44s]  option. We're constantly queue. Also, I want to say something. If you are playing
[4823.44s -> 4829.68s]  make sure, and this is just a really good standardized bit of advice, make sure you're
[4829.68s -> 4836.72s]  always tracking what the enemy cooldowns are, what their spells are, stuff like that's.
[4836.72s -> 4841.32s]  Okay? Because playing the game is not just about like farming and, you know, like your team
[4841.32s -> 4844.66s]  goes in and you auto and shits, like right now, mid to me, alright? I can see that
[4844.66s -> 4849.30s]  But it is a verus, so I'm not too worried about being like a little too divided verus
[4850.10s -> 4853.70s]  Not that much right, so I can kind of play backward because I know that
[4854.90s -> 4859.06s]  It's a high chance he's not gonna run bottom up with two as a verus now that was like a phase or some shit
[4859.06s -> 4860.58s]  I immediately back up
[4860.58s -> 4865.18s]  So we noticed that it's pretty obvious Recon probably got w level two. We don't know what it is
[4865.38s -> 4868.66s]  But he has Q so he doesn't have shield which means
[4871.97s -> 4876.11s]  Because he doesn't have shield
[4876.11s -> 4879.55s]  It's hard for the reclond to get back out if he fucks up an engage
[4880.43s -> 4885.63s]  So you need to think about these type of things, right now. This is way four I believe and because it's way four
[4886.27s -> 4891.27s]  We're gonna get level three on way four you always get level three on way four if you have full XP
[4893.87s -> 4895.87s]  You get level two on wave two and
[4896.95s -> 4901.67s]  You get level three on way four and these timers for when you get
[4902.79s -> 4909.00s]  Certain webwops, bollin are very important now. I'm gonna hover over here
[4909.76s -> 4911.76s]  Uh, you see how fiddle is right here?
[4913.12s -> 4915.68s]  I'm actually gonna just walk in here and see if I can like
[4917.08s -> 4919.08s]  Yeah, we see him. Nice
[4919.36s -> 4924.12s]  See this is exactly what I was talking about before. Do you see what my support is doing?
[4924.84s -> 4926.84s]  I I left the lane
[4927.92s -> 4934.52s]  Guys, I walked to like stand next to my jungler after we push the wave in my lulu is
[4935.60s -> 4937.60s]  hanging out by herself
[4937.60s -> 4958.77s]  self-botland, but you should just chill in.
[4958.77s -> 4960.89s]  You don't want to do that.
[4960.89s -> 4962.53s]  You don't want to ever want to be the guy
[4962.53s -> 4966.93s]  who's like buy yourself botland as a support.
[4966.93s -> 4970.53s]  Because you don't, like, support's don't need gold, right?
[4970.53s -> 4972.05s]  Not really.
[4972.05s -> 4973.13s]  And you don't need farm.
[4973.13s -> 4974.13s]  You don't need all that shit.
[4974.13s -> 4976.89s]  So if you're 80 carry rooms and unless the wave is fucked
[4976.89s -> 4977.73s]  and they're just being stupid,
[4977.73s -> 4979.41s]  and you have to fix the wave or something,
[4979.41s -> 4981.73s]  you don't want to be buy yourself in the win.
[4981.73s -> 4985.85s]  It just doesn't do anything.
[4985.85s -> 4987.01s]  How do I know auto tower?
[4987.01s -> 4990.57s]  Oh, I used to tell that.
[4990.57s -> 4992.81s]  So there's a way, there's actually a setting
[4992.81s -> 4995.77s]  you can have in the game, where when you hit a button
[4995.77s -> 4998.53s]  and makes it so that I can't physically hit anything
[4998.53s -> 4999.85s]  but a champion.
[4999.85s -> 5003.61s]  It's target, it's called target champions only.
[5003.61s -> 5005.57s]  And it's basically like here, I'll do it for you right now, watch.
[5005.57s -> 5007.37s]  You see how I can hit the tower?
[5007.37s -> 5010.37s]  You see how it's the red sword?
[5010.37s -> 5011.53s]  Look.
[5011.53s -> 5013.05s]  So when I hit this button,
[5013.05s -> 5015.21s]  I can no longer hit the tower or the minions.
[5016.33s -> 5018.25s]  But I can still hit the champions.
[5020.01s -> 5023.09s]  So essentially, when you're fighting at a big minion wave
[5023.09s -> 5024.69s]  or you're fighting under turret,
[5024.69s -> 5025.85s]  you don't want to miss click,
[5027.25s -> 5029.89s]  you just hit target champions only button.
[5029.89s -> 5032.01s]  And it makes it a thousand times easier
[5032.01s -> 5036.60s]  because you can literally only hit the champion.
[5036.60s -> 5047.81s]  It's really nice.
[5047.81s -> 5049.69s]  And you can make the button anything you want, obviously.
[5049.69s -> 5057.66s]  I just, I use Tilda, that's the default.
[5057.66s -> 5059.66s]  I actually wanna tell these guys,
[5059.66s -> 5061.94s]  But I need to wait for the way to push out just a pair.
[5063.06s -> 5064.98s]  The jungler could be bought, but it is a fetal stick.
[5064.98s -> 5067.42s]  So it's like, I don't really care about a fetal stick being bought.
[5067.42s -> 5081.57s]  We can straight up just kill them.
[5081.57s -> 5087.18s]  Okay, well apparently we can't kill them.
[5087.18s -> 5090.22s]  Because apparently my rule, we didn't want to walk up.
[5091.34s -> 5093.22s]  That's so frustrating, man.
[5093.22s -> 5098.06s]  I did fuck up my auto there, but I am a little,
[5098.06s -> 5100.66s]  I am kind of curious what happens.
[5100.66s -> 5101.62s]  I don't have to go watch the Vod.
[5101.62s -> 5102.98s]  I fucked up my kill in the Ziya.
[5102.98s -> 5104.78s]  I think I walked to left and stood there,
[5104.78s -> 5107.06s]  that my movement was bad.
[5107.06s -> 5108.82s]  Like, essentially, when they fight, right?
[5108.82s -> 5112.02s]  I walked like this, I should have walked like this
[5112.02s -> 5115.06s]  because you wanna cut off the Ziya from the gang.
[5115.06s -> 5118.14s]  Now, I do think, when we just blindly ran away,
[5118.14s -> 5119.86s]  I think she kind of grieved,
[5119.86s -> 5121.54s]  you don't need to insta run from gang,
[5121.54s -> 5123.14s]  especially when you could see what I have,
[5123.14s -> 5124.50s]  like I have Durk and Sheen.
[5125.66s -> 5127.66s]  Something that a lot of people do as well
[5127.66s -> 5130.10s]  is they will see that like the numbers are uneven
[5130.10s -> 5131.34s]  and they'll instantly run away.
[5131.34s -> 5134.10s]  They don't think about like how to win the fight or like what the the win
[5134.10s -> 5136.98s]  Conn is of the fight because that's why I was saying before we got gang
[5136.98s -> 5141.06s]  It was like fiddle can't can't can't can't can't and he can't pre-sex fiddle does nothing in the gang
[5141.06s -> 5143.06s]  I had cleanse
[5143.06s -> 5145.30s]  They don't actually beat us in 3v2
[5145.50s -> 5151.14s]  So the problem was is we weren't focusing the same target. I went for the Ziya and she backed really far up
[5151.66s -> 5156.26s]  Now if we had played forward a bit like say she played a little more forward with me
[5156.42s -> 5158.98s]  That would have gone a lot better or if I had played a little more back with her
[5158.98s -> 5166.38s]  It was basically like we don't have comms so the you know I got rough now. Fiddlesticks now
[5166.72s -> 5168.72s]  So it's a little scary
[5168.72s -> 5169.72s]  I
[5169.72s -> 5173.40s]  Don't like playing versus fiddle sticks for like the reason of like 90% of the time
[5174.40s -> 5178.16s]  Players don't know how to ward around fiddle people put words and weird spots
[5178.76s -> 5183.07s]  We should have won that fight though. I'm a little salty
[5183.67s -> 5194.66s]  Mainly myself so this too. We will keep speeding me up
[5194.66s -> 5204.51s]  I want to be honest with you. I don't like when we lose do that. It's like a pet pee
[5204.51s -> 5209.63s]  thing in mind when we lose use their speed. I'm okay with it if I need to dog something
[5209.63s -> 5213.43s]  or I need to chase somebody, but I think it's just so much less value than using it to
[5213.43s -> 5220.43s]  CC. Early game. Early game, the CC of we will like using W is so broken to me because
[5220.43s -> 5232.26s]  they just physically can't move their character for like 1.5 seconds, which is crazy. I think
[5232.26s -> 5241.40s]  fiddles bot. You can kind of tell. You see how they're playing really aggressive. They
[5241.40s -> 5247.56s]  don't beat us to v2. So I'm thinking and they just cleared this word out. I'm thinking
[5247.56s -> 5254.38s]  fiddles either on dragon or he's bush ganking bot somewhere. So I don't really want to walk
[5254.38s -> 5261.88s]  up. You see how this guy is confidently hitting the turret? This is making me think fiddles trying
[5261.88s -> 5274.16s]  to Wayne Gang. Because they cannot beat us to V2. I think Fiddles in here. So I'm actually
[5274.16s -> 5280.20s]  just going to play today. Until we see him on the map, I don't know. I'm not going to
[5280.20s -> 5294.49s]  take the chance. Because you got to think about what you see and what you don't see on
[5294.49s -> 5298.61s]  the map. We can't physically see Fiddles, right? But think about this. We don't see him
[5298.61s -> 5303.53s]  top. That's something you have to think about. We had a ward on Rift just now for 15
[5303.53s -> 5305.53s]  15 seconds, right?
[5305.53s -> 5307.53s]  We didn't see him top.
[5307.53s -> 5310.53s]  So like if he's not top, where is he?
[5310.53s -> 5314.74s]  Now I think he finally left.
[5314.74s -> 5320.65s]  This looks like he went to Dragon.
[5320.65s -> 5330.32s]  Yeah.
[5330.32s -> 5332.32s]  What are we doing, by the way?
[5332.32s -> 5334.32s]  I mean, I guess I'm just going to die.
[5334.32s -> 5337.82s]  Now would be the time to speed me.
[5337.82s -> 5340.82s]  I mean, I don't even know what to say about that.
[5340.82s -> 5342.82s]  Malzahar just didn't walk.
[5342.82s -> 5348.74s]  Gregus didn't flash his E.
[5348.74s -> 5350.74s]  Malzahar didn't walk.
[5350.74s -> 5355.90s]  you always walk there by the way I want to make this clear if you're a middle
[5355.90s -> 5360.66s]  inner and you're playing a late game scaling mid you always walk to the
[5360.66s -> 5365.86s]  fight no matter what though if it's at if it's going if it's doing that okay
[5365.86s -> 5375.10s]  guys we need to walk to fights and we need to follow up when I go in don't
[5375.10s -> 5382.61s]  run I'm just gonna type it because I'm actually fucking annoying my little
[5382.61s -> 5389.81s]  frustrated. I still think the game is 100% one of old, but I'm playing Draven. We're playing like I'm playing fucking Ezreal or some shit
[5390.53s -> 5395.41s]  And I can't walk up because essentially it we know Fiddle was bought for the last two three minutes, right?
[5395.41s -> 5412.06s]  He just sat down there. What is my loop loop doing bro? What are you doing? No, we fight this go
[5413.34s -> 5422.11s]  Yeah, this guy doesn't get to do this for free now. They have a gale force, so I need to be a little care
[5422.11s -> 5425.11s]  This guy has no ulti though.
[5425.11s -> 5431.58s]  But this is what I'm losing my mind, man.
[5431.58s -> 5434.58s]  I do, just follow.
[5434.58s -> 5443.32s]  No, what she was doing, what she was trying to protect her ward.
[5443.32s -> 5449.32s]  She saw the recon hitting the ward, but the Ziya walked up to get a free to just die.
[5449.32s -> 5458.64s]  The problem is, my lubeu was like, oh, I don't want to give up my ward, and she wasn't thinking.
[5458.64s -> 5461.64s]  Please, just sit with me.
[5461.64s -> 5468.64s]  Okay, yeah, sorry, I need you to follow me always.
[5469.88s -> 5474.88s]  Even if it looks scary, you gotta follow, okay?
[5474.88s -> 5489.23s]  Also, one thing is there's actually not a lot of fighting that happens in lower ego.
[5489.23s -> 5497.23s]  So a lot of these players don't know how to fight early because one thing that I think has gotten really bad about me lately,
[5497.23s -> 5502.19s]  Just in the past few years is people don't ever limit test and league ever anymore
[5502.59s -> 5507.87s]  They always just play like Pussies every single player in league plays like a fucking pussy not as
[5508.75s -> 5521.36s]  And it's it's literally just like sad to see like right there. Why aren't we wing?
[5521.98s -> 5535.05s]  Use w on the Ziya not to speed like I'm losing my mind because all you have to do there is w the Ziya
[5535.05s -> 5535.89s]  I actually get CCed.
[5535.89s -> 5536.85s]  We kill her on the W.
[5538.33s -> 5540.37s]  I'm telling you, blue blue players are like hard,
[5540.37s -> 5545.37s]  wired for some reason to not play correctly.
[5562.14s -> 5563.14s]  I'm never gonna catch this guy.
[5563.14s -> 5570.93s]  He's got Gail forcing to your two boots.
[5570.93s -> 5572.57s]  Yeah, I mean, I have to go forward though
[5572.57s -> 5574.97s]  because if I don't go for Gail, it's now the games over.
[5574.97s -> 5576.61s]  So I'd see there we go for it, I mean, lose.
[5576.61s -> 5582.12s]  So I'm willing to like look stupid.
[5582.12s -> 5585.16s]  Honestly, this game was my fault for the one to be three
[5585.16s -> 5586.00s]  that happened early.
[5586.00s -> 5587.16s]  I misplied it.
[5587.16s -> 5588.36s]  And if I didn't misplied that,
[5588.36s -> 5590.64s]  we would have won the game off it.
[5590.64s -> 5592.12s]  Now the game's pretty much over.
[5592.12s -> 5593.36s]  I don't know.
[5593.36s -> 5595.48s]  Like, it's so okay so we can always come back.
[5595.48s -> 5599.28s]  But the problem is, I don't think we have good enough
[5599.28s -> 5600.68s]  players to come back.
[5600.68s -> 5601.84s]  Like look at what Lou was doing.
[5601.84s -> 5606.28s]  Lou, why are you bought so low at the moment?
[5606.28s -> 5610.27s]  Think, like what?
[5610.27s -> 5622.06s]  It's, ah, ah, what are we doing?
[5622.06s -> 5624.02s]  This is exactly what I was telling you guys,
[5624.02s -> 5625.70s]  it doesn't make sense.
[5625.70s -> 5630.14s]  Remember when I told you supports easy, all you have to do is be a human.
[5630.14s -> 5636.28s]  Remember when I said that 40 sec or four minutes ago before the game started?
[5636.28s -> 5640.56s]  All you have to do to play support is think, push buttons, and be active in the game.
[5640.56s -> 5646.79s]  And if you can do those things, you'll get chavinger on support.
[5646.79s -> 5649.11s]  Like it blows my mind.
[5649.11s -> 5671.69s]  Like look at what you're doing!
[5671.69s -> 5672.69s]  This is a forfe, though.
[5672.69s -> 5676.55s]  I'm gonna lose my mind.
[5676.55s -> 5677.91s]  Auto filled AD.
[5677.91s -> 5691.58s]  I'm gonna lose it.
[5691.58s -> 5692.58s]  My bad, yes.
[5692.58s -> 5705.94s]  I'm just bad. It's on me. I apologize. Oh, yeah, these players are crazy
[5706.44s -> 5712.01s]  I'm actually really surprised where it's not forfeiting now
[5715.20s -> 5720.32s]  The best way to play the game is something that like I fall victim to too, right fuck this up sometimes, right
[5720.68s -> 5722.68s]  But the best way to play the game a lot of the time is
[5723.32s -> 5726.04s]  You essentially don't play to take risks
[5727.80s -> 5732.24s]  I know it sounds silly because you you gotta find essentially you have to find the
[5732.24s -> 5747.34s]  Um, my mouth is a hard, just let this guy, this 1000 gold walk away. Hey, mouse, if you moved by the way, you get one
[5747.34s -> 5776.74s]  K gold. Mid isn't hard roll. I can mid in my sleep. It's not. It is easiest roll. I'm 80
[5776.74s -> 5792.00s]  carry streamer. I play AD, but Lulu is small brain. That was mean. Lulu took some cross
[5792.00s -> 5816.26s]  fire there that she didn't need to take. That was my bad. That was toxic. I'll be real.
[5816.26s -> 5821.30s]  I think today is going to be a mute all kind of day. Listening to low elo players talk
[5821.30s -> 5825.14s]  about the game and then they think that they're right about the game and like how it works
[5825.14s -> 5829.70s]  and all the shits. It actually like hurts me. Like it shouldn't. I should just laugh it off,
[5829.70s -> 5835.54s]  But sometimes when I see a low-Evo player talk about how they think the game should be played and I just know that they're wrong
[5836.06s -> 5843.41s]  It actually like physically hurts me. It does it physically hurts
[5853.38s -> 5859.98s]  But I should follow my own rule where if you're playing with people that aren't as good like they don't see what you see
[5860.66s -> 5865.58s]  Right there's like something where it's better to play safe in scale even on driving
[5865.86s -> 5869.30s]  It's better to play safe in scale than to go for plays in lane
[5871.86s -> 5881.06s]  Mainly because if you go for plays in lane and let's say your support is not as good as you
[5881.06s -> 5885.86s]  or your support is not confident in their ability to 2v2 right then you're just going to lose.
[5885.86s -> 5889.86s]  So you're like forcing that person to be in an uncomfortable situation.
[5889.86s -> 5896.86s]  So it's hard for me as a player to just play safe when I see the enemy making mistake after mistake.
[5896.86s -> 5902.18s]  It's like something that I have trouble like personally working on right just like a personal issue
[5902.50s -> 5907.06s]  Where like I'll see an enemy make a mistake positional wise and I'm like, oh shit. Let's abuse this
[5907.30s -> 5909.30s]  But a lot of the time the problem that happens is
[5910.42s -> 5914.66s]  You have somebody who doesn't know that that person made a mistake or doesn't see the same mistake as me
[5914.66s -> 5916.18s]  And because there's no comms
[5916.18s -> 5920.98s]  I can't relate to them that we should fight right so if I go in and they don't know that we should be fighting there
[5920.98s -> 5928.52s]  I end up dying and it looks it feels really bad which is I mean
[5928.94s -> 5934.44s]  My fault. It's like a personal thing because you can't control your supports. You can only control yourself.
[5934.44s -> 5937.94s]  It's just something that like I suck at doing sometimes.
[5937.94s -> 5964.14s]  Right? So that's just on man.
[5964.14s -> 5968.14s]  We could actually kill the Zyron, by the way. She's like 60% HP.
[5968.14s -> 5998.41s]  Like we could kill her. What is my braggess doing? Oh, he got her though, nice.
[5998.41s -> 6009.20s]  Bro, use W. Just you see people.
[6009.20s -> 6012.20s]  Not to speed people.
[6012.20s -> 6020.48s]  That was a good example, too. Oh well.
[6020.48s -> 6028.46s]  I just got to get better doing that where I play safe though.
[6028.46s -> 6030.46s]  That's on me. That's just a personal thing.
[6030.46s -> 6032.46s]  I got to get better out. Oh man.
[6032.46s -> 6061.38s]  I think we're warmed up though.
[6061.38s -> 6063.38s]  What 80 carried you guys want to see next game?
[6063.38s -> 6066.38s]  That was, that was a brutal ask game.
[6066.38s -> 6070.38s]  I'm gonna be real. That was a brutal ask game.
[6070.38s -> 6078.38s]  What 80 carry streamer do you guys want to say or 80 kick stream? What 80 carry champion? Do you guys want to see this game?
[6078.38s -> 6087.80s]  I just goofed up and tried to play to aggressive with the player that wasn't going to play aggressive. That was on me.
[6087.80s -> 6111.57s]  That's my bad. I'll play better. Sky, this guy goes sion.
[6111.57s -> 6126.06s]  Never change to a chat, never change.
[6126.06s -> 6143.23s]  Well, the thing is, you have to change my mindset.
[6143.23s -> 6145.23s]  So like the thing, okay, let me explain something
[6145.23s -> 6147.23s]  that's like a personal thing with me.
[6147.23s -> 6150.23s]  I'm very, very, very good mechanically at this game, right?
[6150.23s -> 6153.23s]  It's my best trade is like I have very good mechanics.
[6153.23s -> 6156.23s]  So, and I also have like an autistic weird brain
[6156.23s -> 6162.23s]  where I can see, I have really a pattern recognition.
[6162.23s -> 6168.59s]  So when I see that the enemy is fcking up, I know that I'm pretty much always going to be better at the 2v2.
[6169.47s -> 6178.47s]  Okay. So because I know that I'm always going to be better at the 2v2, I always want to take the fight.
[6179.87s -> 6185.67s]  When I see that they make a mistake like they miss a skill shot or they walk up too far stuff like that, right?
[6185.67s -> 6192.17s]  But the problem is when you're balling, you have to work with a teammate and that's part of just playing 80 carry, right?
[6192.17s -> 6204.67s]  And if you're in so much, you can't always do it. So you have to, I have to like train myself to just be okay with them making mistakes and us not abusing those mistakes.
[6204.67s -> 6210.67s]  It's very frustrating for me personally because I'm a perfectionist. So it's very frustrating for me to like see this happening and I'm like,
[6210.67s -> 6217.67s]  Oh, I want to abuse this because I know we can, but we have to like I have to like tell myself not to and to just like not fuck up the waves
[6217.67s -> 6221.67s]  They not take bad trades and shit because every there's there's more to it too
[6221.67s -> 6226.87s]  So if like I walk up and I take a fight, right? Let's say like when we're con w didn't when the fiddle game for example, right?
[6227.67s -> 6236.67s]  Uh, if I take that fight, I'm now banking that fight on Lulu also playing correctly, right? Like they they missed all their abilities and they fucked up
[6236.67s -> 6244.67s]  up, but I also messed like, you, nobody can play perfectly every game. Like I can't
[6244.67s -> 6247.95s]  teammates can't, nobody can't. It's legal. We're all humans, right? So you have to
[6247.95s -> 6251.87s]  bank when you're doing that on like your teammate being able to know what you want to
[6251.87s -> 6256.75s]  accomplish in that moment. And so I'll cue with no comms and it's really hard. Like it's
[6256.75s -> 6263.71s]  a really bad mindset that I have sometimes. But it's hard to get over because like I like
[6263.71s -> 6269.17s]  like the waning phase for me is the most fun part of the game.
[6269.17s -> 6270.65s]  I have what waning phase,
[6270.65s -> 6271.65s]  because in my opinion,
[6271.65s -> 6273.37s]  waning phase is like a little mini chess game
[6273.37s -> 6274.81s]  between the enemy, Bob, and, right?
[6275.93s -> 6278.97s]  It's like a chess game with like mechanics.
[6278.97s -> 6283.17s]  Where it's like, how well can I auto-space them, right?
[6283.17s -> 6284.89s]  Can I space them well?
[6284.89s -> 6287.13s]  Can I space them like, can I, by spacing?
[6287.13s -> 6288.29s]  I mean, can I walk into them?
[6288.29s -> 6291.01s]  Trade and not take damage back, right?
[6291.01s -> 6292.13s]  And I'm always thinking to myself, okay,
[6292.13s -> 6292.97s]  can I do that?
[6292.97s -> 6293.81s]  I can.
[6293.81s -> 6295.37s]  And I'm like, I wanna do this, right?
[6295.37s -> 6299.45s]  and then I'll get somebody to half and then they'll panic and they'll engage on me.
[6299.45s -> 6304.65s]  And the problem is though, is like I said, without comms or without like people who are
[6304.65s -> 6311.85s]  recognizing what you're trying to accomplish, sometimes supports and junglers, people get flustered
[6311.85s -> 6315.93s]  and it will go badly. And it's my fault at the end of the day because I'm choosing to
[6315.93s -> 6321.37s]  that play style of relying on my teammates instead of like knowing that I can probably outscale
[6321.37s -> 6326.89s]  and play better away game and just like keep good CS and not die on shit, which is what you guys should all do.
[6327.93s -> 6331.53s]  And that's what I tell people to do when they ask me how to play a game. I tell you like,
[6331.53s -> 6336.97s]  don't die, scale up, get items. But like because I've played the game for so long and my favorite
[6336.97s -> 6343.21s]  part of the game is land phase and like winning land and playing that little chess game,
[6343.21s -> 6349.21s]  I fucked myself over in a lot of games because I'll like, you know, force fights that like my
[6349.21s -> 6352.09s]  My teammate would have to play well in as well to win.
[6352.09s -> 6354.33s]  And I'll make a mistake or I'll make a mistake
[6354.33s -> 6355.93s]  and we'll just lose the game off it.
[6355.93s -> 6358.41s]  And it's not a good playstyle.
[6359.97s -> 6361.33s]  Right, it's not a good playstyle.
[6362.57s -> 6364.21s]  That's just like something that like,
[6364.21s -> 6367.29s]  I know other people probably also have.
[6367.29s -> 6368.97s]  And I'm telling you that like, if you wanna climb,
[6368.97s -> 6370.53s]  you gotta get out of that mindset
[6370.53s -> 6376.51s]  and get into the mindset of like, consistency.
[6376.51s -> 6378.99s]  Cause you can see last game, for example,
[6378.99s -> 6388.99s]  I just straight up, like, lost the game off of me, trying to fight when my support didn't know how to fight or want to fight, and we lost the game off it.
[6392.01s -> 6397.01s]  Like, I was too aggro, and even though if they did play correctly, we win, they didn't, so we lost.
[6397.01s -> 6404.01s]  So it's basically like, it's just not like a good, uh, it's not a good, uh, what's the word I'm looking for?
[6404.01s -> 6417.38s]  strategy because last game was my fault because I'm good enough at the game that I
[6417.38s -> 6421.42s]  know that I can't play like that if I want to be consistent and I still point
[6421.42s -> 6429.46s]  like it so it's my ban. I want to replay in this game boys we got Rengar,
[6429.46s -> 6434.10s]  Karma, Jin. What if people want to see? Let me see if any of the 80 characters
[6434.10s -> 6439.54s]  people want to see if I can play these. I can't play vain into this. The vein would
[6439.54s -> 6451.40s]  be way too hard in the Karma, Jin. I would just get so enough to wave. I can play
[6451.40s -> 6455.40s]  This is actually a good of failures game.
[6455.40s -> 6461.08s]  You know what kind of sucks?
[6461.08s -> 6462.08s]  I feel kind of bad playing a
[6462.08s -> 6465.08s]  failures when I'm on my teaching accounts.
[6465.08s -> 6467.08s]  Like this account to like teach you guys.
[6467.08s -> 6470.08s]  I feel bad playing a failure sometimes.
[6470.08s -> 6473.08s]  Because I know a lot of people don't
[6473.08s -> 6475.08s]  want to learn a failure or play a
[6475.08s -> 6478.08s]  failures because he is like really.
[6478.08s -> 6481.08s]  He's very unique.
[6481.08s -> 6489.16s]  a unique. He's hard to learn for a lot of people. I always feel kind of bad doing it.
[6491.16s -> 6495.48s]  But I'll be real. I don't know in this specific situation outside of like jinx.
[6497.24s -> 6499.24s]  I didn't really know what else to pick.
[6500.12s -> 6504.44s]  Like jinx is good. Kaisas probably okay, but you still get zoned off the way of unkaisa.
[6511.94s -> 6513.46s]  Because like if we if we look at this, right?
[6513.46s -> 6547.58s]  I guess okay but when you're picking a champion for bot lane right when you're picking a champion for bot lane one thing that you guys should think about when picking like what you know what champion you want to play unless you're a one trick and then play whatever you want but if you're like somebody who wants to actually like play the meta and learn why champions are meta and when to pick what they picked gin karma now we have a lulu if we had something with a hook like a nodalist
[6547.62s -> 6552.74s]  It's a blitz, a thrash, a pike, like if we had something like that, I could pick a low-range
[6552.74s -> 6553.74s]  fighter, right?
[6553.74s -> 6558.26s]  Like I could pick a low-range fighter if we had a hookchimp.
[6558.26s -> 6562.78s]  But because we don't have a hookchimp and we have an enchanter, I have to pick something that
[6562.78s -> 6567.86s]  can safely consistently farm and not get zoned off by their bow-in.
[6567.86s -> 6570.74s]  So there's not a lot of options that can do that.
[6570.74s -> 6574.62s]  There's like, I didn't want to pick, you could pick Ezreal here, it's not the worst, but
[6574.62s -> 6576.22s]  We had a blue loose, so I didn't want to pick Ezreal,
[6576.22s -> 6578.14s]  because we lose goes the waste.
[6578.14s -> 6579.26s]  So it's like you could pick jinx,
[6579.26s -> 6580.90s]  but I kind of didn't want to pick jinx this game,
[6580.90s -> 6583.38s]  because jinx borne is the shit outta me right now.
[6583.38s -> 6586.50s]  So this would be a good jinx game though,
[6586.50s -> 6587.30s]  if you guys are curious,
[6587.30s -> 6589.34s]  like this would be a completely fine jinx game.
[6589.34s -> 6591.38s]  Your E stops Rangar Jump.
[6593.74s -> 6595.70s]  You can follow up really easily with Lulu,
[6595.70s -> 6596.98s]  like this would be a good jinx game.
[6599.98s -> 6602.02s]  But a failure, it's a good failure scheme, too.
[6602.02s -> 6602.86s]  It's both.
[6602.86s -> 6604.22s]  It's gonna fail as game, good jinx game.
[6604.22s -> 6606.80s]  Um, it could be a good Xary game.
[6606.80s -> 6611.86s]  Xary wouldn't be that bad here with Lulu and against their comp, uh, they're all really
[6611.86s -> 6612.86s]  squishy.
[6612.86s -> 6613.86s]  She's really mobile.
[6613.86s -> 6616.10s]  It can get away from like, ring our ganks pretty easily.
[6616.10s -> 6618.10s]  Tristana, I, okay.
[6618.10s -> 6624.14s]  So Trist is unique because you only picked Tristana if you plan on winning land.
[6624.14s -> 6625.14s]  Okay.
[6625.14s -> 6630.98s]  Tristana doesn't actually scale better than Jinks in any way.
[6630.98s -> 6635.06s]  Like she does not have a better scaling than jinx.
[6635.06s -> 6637.14s]  Trist versus jinx three items.
[6637.14s -> 6640.94s]  Jinx wins every time and team fights no matter what.
[6640.94s -> 6644.10s]  Like she just does what Trist does better.
[6644.10s -> 6647.74s]  Now, the reason you pick Trist is because you do want to win lane.
[6647.74s -> 6650.98s]  You want to jump in, you want to kill them, you want to be aggressive, right?
[6650.98s -> 6652.18s]  So that's what you're picking Trist for.
[6652.18s -> 6654.26s]  It's that I get kills in lane.
[6654.26s -> 6656.90s]  The problem is, is again, what we were just talking about, right?
[6656.90s -> 6659.18s]  Let's say I pick Trist to get kills in lane.
[6659.18s -> 6663.50s]  Now let's say my support doesn't want to be aggressive.
[6663.50s -> 6667.82s]  And let's say like the Jane in the karma have a really good push, okay?
[6667.82s -> 6671.66s]  Something that Trist is really weak at is being pushed in, right?
[6671.66s -> 6675.34s]  That's one of our weakest things, but she has, she struggles, especially early game.
[6675.34s -> 6678.30s]  She struggles quite a bit on farming under turn.
[6678.30s -> 6682.86s]  So let's say it's just like a coin-flippy pick.
[6682.86s -> 6687.62s]  You could pick Trist if you add a support duo for sure.
[6687.62s -> 6689.86s]  Indigent, trust is amazing, Indigent.
[6689.86s -> 6692.18s]  It's one of Jen's hardest actual counters.
[6692.18s -> 6694.66s]  But again, it's not about countering the champion,
[6694.66s -> 6695.62s]  it's about countering the lane,
[6695.62s -> 6697.42s]  and what the lane is going to do to you,
[6697.42s -> 6699.74s]  and being able to play around that.
[6699.74s -> 6701.62s]  And this lane is a shove lane.
[6701.62s -> 6703.18s]  Jen, Karma, doesn't fight you.
[6703.18s -> 6705.06s]  They poke you and shove waves in.
[6705.06s -> 6705.90s]  That's what they do.
[6705.90s -> 6706.98s]  They're a prior lane.
[6706.98s -> 6709.22s]  So they're just going to shove and shove, right?
[6709.22s -> 6711.46s]  So because they're just going to shove and shove,
[6711.46s -> 6713.82s]  I need to play something that isn't going to have issues
[6713.82s -> 6715.54s]  playing under turret or something that can shove back
[6715.54s -> 6716.30s]  if I need to.
[6716.30s -> 6725.10s]  right, which is why jinx, a fellow y'all are both good, as real again would just get
[6725.10s -> 6726.72s]  shoved in stuff like that, right?
[6726.72s -> 6730.80s]  These are things you actually have to think about when you're playing the game for certain
[6730.80s -> 6736.80s]  champions, and certain matchups, because a lot of the time people will pick a champion
[6736.80s -> 6740.50s]  that's meta and they won't understand why they're still losing the matchup, even though
[6740.50s -> 6744.94s]  they're good at that champion, and it's just that you're not bad at the champ, the matchup
[6744.94s -> 6751.34s]  is just unplayable. You could put Faker double-lift, fucking Gumiasi in certain matchups,
[6751.34s -> 6755.26s]  and they will just lose. They will lose the matchups. And it's because no matter how good
[6755.26s -> 6761.84s]  your mechanics are, if the matchup is played correctly, it's not win-able. And that's why
[6761.84s -> 6765.68s]  you see him pro play, drafting is so important. It's perfect example of why it in pro play,
[6765.68s -> 6769.44s]  drafting is 10 times more important than solo queue. And it's because when everybody plays
[6769.44s -> 6774.65s]  the matchups correctly in shit, right? When everybody's playing the matchups correctly in shit,
[6774.65s -> 6782.57s]  the matchup like skill becomes a thousand times more important. Or like you know how the matchups being
[6782.57s -> 6788.97s]  play like the champions become way more important. Whoa what the fuck? I'm on there just fuck
[6788.97s -> 6798.57s]  that what the hell is going on. Another little tip for you guys. Ooh I fuck that but another little tip for you guys
[6798.57s -> 6815.45s]  is melee champions or melee minions take one turret shot two autos or sorry two turret shots one
[6815.45s -> 6820.65s]  one auto and caster's take one auto one turret shot when you're under turrets like
[6820.65s -> 6823.37s]  luck all right so
[6823.37s -> 6825.77s]  wording uh... this will be actually a pretty game to explain you how to
[6825.77s -> 6827.77s]  form of the turret actually
[6827.77s -> 6829.77s]  i was thinking about what i could teach you as because we're just getting a
[6829.77s -> 6832.89s]  shoved in a lot this game
[6832.89s -> 6840.08s]  section of that bad though
[6840.08s -> 6844.24s]  uh... so right now we could actually space forward here
[6844.24s -> 6856.49s]  okay that did not hit me that was bs but sure
[6856.49s -> 6859.49s]  I did the same thing, I did last game man.
[6861.05s -> 6862.21s]  I did the same thing.
[6862.21s -> 6863.29s]  You said I walked up.
[6864.41s -> 6867.89s]  It wasn't, it was a good fight, but again,
[6867.89s -> 6868.73s]  I keep doing that.
[6868.73s -> 6871.25s]  We're like, I see the fight and I'll take the fight
[6871.25s -> 6874.65s]  because I know it's a good fight, but Louis was too far back.
[6874.65s -> 6878.52s]  So I ended up just inting.
[6878.52s -> 6881.91s]  It's really stupid.
[6881.91s -> 6898.00s]  I got a such a dumb play by me
[6898.00s -> 6899.32s]  because I had to pull up all my sums right there
[6899.32s -> 6902.40s]  because the gym, or I mean,
[6902.40s -> 6905.28s]  the gym was in a really bad spot and the car moves in a really bad spot because I was
[6905.28s -> 6909.24s]  level 3 and they were level 2 and they were walking up to contest waves.
[6909.24s -> 6914.56s]  But my lube was behind me and when you're playing, you know, it's all like you.
[6914.56s -> 6917.16s]  You have to play as a team with your teammate.
[6917.16s -> 6926.16s]  Okay, so this gym is kind of griefing right now.
[6926.16s -> 6929.28s]  He's griefing by walking up when I'm blue gunning him.
[6929.28s -> 6936.04s]  I don't know what lube is doing.
[6936.04s -> 6937.28s]  I'm just killing that guy nice.
[6937.28s -> 6941.88s]  Yeah, they're griefing really hard, so the blue gun is OP for what you just saw.
[6941.88s -> 6945.68s]  You have to do with the blue gun if you really want to just like have a funny ass overpowered fucking
[6947.04s -> 6950.64s]  When they're farming under the turret like that just hit the minions
[6957.89s -> 6959.89s]  Okay, we're getting ganks
[6960.49s -> 6970.76s]  Back up so I kind of did a cardinal sin there. I would say like a sin of like I
[6971.52s -> 6973.52s]  Overstate a bit. I think I
[6974.92s -> 6977.92s]  Okay, we'll fuck off. You
[6977.92s -> 6983.08s]  That was greedy. I should have backed that the turret, but I didn't think that car was actually new that, but I
[6983.08s -> 6987.72s]  Did overstate because you can see like this is the perfect example of why I overstate so they stopped my back, right?
[6987.72s -> 6988.72s]  I
[6988.72s -> 6991.52s]  Can give you guys a really good example of what just happens. I
[6992.48s -> 6997.24s]  Overstade and when I overstade, I didn't actually get anything out of it. Oh, I got
[6997.44s -> 7001.44s]  But you saw I just have extra gold for nothing. So now I just have extra gold, right?
[7001.44s -> 7006.00s]  And because I have extra gold the gin actually gets in that positive because they stopped my back
[7006.00s -> 7010.24s]  So he gets a free plate here. I miss a cannon and even though I'm still up 10 C.S
[7010.80s -> 7012.96s]  It's like I could have been up 10 C.S
[7013.28s -> 7015.28s]  Not given a plate and not
[7015.28s -> 7018.28s]  Mr. Cannon. So it's it's basically like
[7019.84s -> 7026.60s]  It's interesting should you get prior for your jungle or every game? No, no, that's not important
[7029.50s -> 7031.50s]  Some games prior was important
[7031.94s -> 7037.14s]  It's very important some games but you don't need to always be thinking about getting prior for jungle
[7037.14s -> 7042.10s]  That's not something you should be like thinking about like always right like you think about it in terms of like timers
[7043.10s -> 7047.80s]  That's important, but prior for jungle or always is not like something you should be
[7048.98s -> 7058.96s]  Worrying abouts because if you're perma shoving and you're like, oh, I have prior for my jungler, but then your jungler doesn't do anything
[7059.76s -> 7068.05s]  Like having that prior if you don't have prior, it doesn't do anything like I'd rather hold the wave and like a certain spot
[7069.33s -> 7102.48s]  Oh my god, I suck. I mean it worked out
[7103.20s -> 7107.84s]  I think if I was six, I triple kill them there, but I
[7109.00s -> 7113.96s]  Think we actually all I think we actually triple kill them to if we will help to me, but again
[7114.76s -> 7161.86s]  You guys know what I'm gonna say I go back to the thing. I don't know for anger has ulterior not
[7162.50s -> 7168.31s]  I want to shove this because
[7175.21s -> 7186.69s]  Chill I want to shove it in for seconds and I really don't have anything to do so to stand here
[7186.69s -> 7189.03s]  You want to also be back back
[7189.03s -> 7191.79s]  once it's hit for one day by boots.
[7191.79s -> 7194.15s]  I thought I was using by boots running early.
[7194.15s -> 7197.63s]  He's a champion where the more attacks you do
[7197.63s -> 7200.15s]  is actually very valuable and positioning on a failure
[7200.15s -> 7201.35s]  is very important.
[7201.35s -> 7203.99s]  It's kind of like some 80 carries,
[7203.99s -> 7205.91s]  like you don't need boots really early,
[7205.91s -> 7207.43s]  like with like jinx for example,
[7207.43s -> 7209.75s]  I usually go free boots, right?
[7209.75s -> 7212.71s]  Or I go boots like after my cracking,
[7212.71s -> 7214.15s]  but with a failure,
[7215.15s -> 7217.15s]  I really like the early mobility,
[7217.15s -> 7226.91s]  the early trading stuff like that's okay so always be watching the map too we
[7226.91s -> 7230.75s]  see the rangars top right we can actually just straight fight these guys 2v2
[7230.75s -> 7245.13s]  right now uh what wait what what what's my lulu doing homey what what are we he's
[7245.13s -> 7269.60s]  holding us so you're saying helping the 80 carriers back got it I can't believe
[7269.60s -> 7277.52s]  Leave my blue blue just walked away from me and just like watch like you work as a team.
[7277.52s -> 7282.57s]  This is something that I cannot stress enough.
[7282.57s -> 7285.13s]  Play as a team.
[7285.13s -> 7289.21s]  When you play League of Legends, this tells me more than anything because this happens
[7289.21s -> 7295.81s]  even in Grandmaster, I see teammates who will be selfish and not help each other.
[7295.81s -> 7298.33s]  Just help each other.
[7298.33s -> 7312.35s]  each other please man. We are a team. Don't just run and leave your ADC. Like I'm not even flaming you, but like dude, you can't do that.
[7313.55s -> 7321.39s]  You can't be upset that like I can't dodge every spell. Well, come to the league. I feel like something that I noticed that happens a lot.
[7321.39s -> 7327.69s]  I can't believe that is players will have this weirdly high expectation for everyone to play
[7327.69s -> 7334.33s]  absolutely perfect at all times and and they want me to like be goomy Aussie and I'm like dude
[7334.33s -> 7338.39s]  I dodged two of the gin bullets. I dodged a karma cue
[7339.49s -> 7344.21s]  Like you woulder like I can't dodge literally everything will slow, right? Like that's not how it works
[7344.93s -> 7355.38s]  Like dude, I'm gonna lose my mind with this guy
[7355.38s -> 7399.20s]  Hi, I wu wu is blaming me. It's okay. It's okay. I don't need to be upset. It's fine.
[7399.20s -> 7411.26s]  The movie player is totally okay. You know, sometimes people think they're right.
[7411.26s -> 7427.89s]  It's just what happens in the worlds. Right? It's just, it is what it is. No big deal.
[7427.89s -> 7446.14s]  big deal. Sorry, I'm trying really hard to not be an asshole right now. This is what
[7446.14s -> 7450.78s]  we're player is making me like making me one of like fun fanos. You know what I mean?
[7450.78s -> 7457.98s]  Like this guy is like making me like this guy like we talk about we like in league we talk
[7457.98s -> 7464.46s]  about like the players like we talk about 80 carry players having ego. I genuinely think
[7464.46s -> 7471.46s]  I think support players have five times the ego 80 carry players have but with like a third of the skill.
[7471.46s -> 7482.26s]  I think 80 carry players do have massive egos but again I don't think that like
[7482.26s -> 7487.26s]  I'd support players are genuinely the dumbest mother fucking humans on the planet
[7487.26s -> 7493.26s]  and they think that they're the best players to ever touch the game and it hurts my fucking balls.
[7493.26s -> 7520.66s]  Hey, Blue Blue, would you be willing to have a...
[7520.66s -> 7526.14s]  ...vod review with me in Discord after the game?
[7526.14s -> 7530.10s]  Let's just see, I want to see if like this person is willing to listen to reason.
[7530.10s -> 7560.13s]  Let's see, I'm trying to not tell, but it's really frustrating.
[7560.13s -> 7567.09s]  Because this player is playing specifically for KDA, and they're playing like they don't
[7567.09s -> 7571.49s]  understand how like I can already tell you if I go look at this person's OP.G
[7571.49s -> 7576.99s]  they only play for KDA I can tell you right now right here this person plays only
[7576.99s -> 7582.33s]  for KDA never takes any risks doesn't ever help their 80 carry ever when they get
[7582.33s -> 7586.85s]  behind doesn't ever walk up to like try and fight doesn't do any of that I can
[7586.85s -> 7589.93s]  tell you right now without even looking at their OP.G from how this person
[7589.93s -> 7599.30s]  plays but they have high KDA's but really well-wind-wind but I don't want my entire
[7599.30s -> 7602.74s]  streamed to be pitching about this Lulu so we'll try and focus on how to win from this position.
[7603.62s -> 7607.06s]  I'm sure you guys get shitty supports too. So we'll try and focus on how to win from the
[7607.06s -> 7623.97s]  car position around. Yeah it doesn't get better. I mean I'll be honest with you, my grandmaster
[7623.97s -> 7629.57s]  supports on my main sock. Like it doesn't get better. They get better like mechanically at the game,
[7629.57s -> 7635.49s]  right? Like the higher elo supports get better mechanically, but they get worse. They don't get
[7635.49s -> 7640.13s]  better when like it doesn't get better. It's always like you'll either have a really good
[7640.13s -> 7673.80s]  support or you have somebody who sniffs glue. I'm just dead or I'm not dead.
[7673.80s -> 7680.86s]  Huh? Honestly, our biggest issue here is I need to get one-thirstor a-sap.
[7680.86s -> 7693.88s]  Once I get BT, the game gets a lot easier. We could kill this guy right now.
[7693.88s -> 7698.94s]  If the Wu Wu helps me, we can actually just straight kill these guys because I can
[7698.94s -> 7703.60s]  ulti to kill myself, right? We have Wu Wu ult. I have ult to kill myself and I'm strong.
[7703.60s -> 7712.60s]  She has ignite, I have everything, where we could easily kill that Talia right there.
[7712.60s -> 7715.60s]  I mean, yeah, whatever, man.
[7715.60s -> 7721.16s]  This is what I'm talking about.
[7721.16s -> 7727.16s]  Again, are you willing to get into discord and Voderva?
[7727.16s -> 7728.16s]  Yes or no?
[7728.16s -> 7739.00s]  I mean, I have to be honest with you.
[7739.00s -> 7743.56s]  The reason this is frustrating is because as an ADC player,
[7743.56s -> 7748.90s]  player, you want to be able to rely on your support, right? You want to be able to make
[7748.90s -> 7753.64s]  plays, go in, fight, and rely on your teammates because as an ADC player, support an
[7753.64s -> 7759.40s]  ADC or like a duo, right? Like you want to play it together. No, no, man, I'm not attacking
[7759.40s -> 7776.02s]  you. I'm saying, let's discord after you can explain your POV and I'll explain mine.
[7776.02s -> 7778.80s]  We can improve this player.
[7778.80s -> 7784.42s]  Like get them to be a better player and not ruin every game they play in.
[7784.42s -> 7791.12s]  Like that would be the goat.
[7791.12s -> 7792.88s]  Like that did not hit me by the way.
[7792.88s -> 7794.20s]  And it hit boxes for yes.
[7794.20s -> 7810.20s]  But I don't even understand.
[7810.20s -> 7817.04s]  Oh, man.
[7817.04s -> 7822.77s]  This is the person's by the way.
[7822.77s -> 7825.09s]  This is the person's LP.G.
[7825.09s -> 7826.57s]  Average win rate.
[7826.57s -> 7828.49s]  50% win rate, like I said,
[7828.49s -> 7832.03s]  has really good KDA's on all his champs.
[7832.03s -> 7835.11s]  But he doesn't win.
[7835.11s -> 7837.07s]  I'm telling you right now,
[7837.07s -> 7838.89s]  the biggest thing in league,
[7838.89s -> 7841.99s]  that the biggest thing in league of legends
[7841.99s -> 7846.45s]  is believing that you are a good player based on KDA.
[7846.45s -> 7850.23s]  If I go look at any challenger level support player right now,
[7850.23s -> 7854.55s]  their KDA's will be like four.
[7854.55s -> 7857.33s]  Those don't have good KDA, but it'll be like four and three.
[7857.33s -> 7859.61s]  and it'll be on
[7859.61s -> 7861.41s]  that's your mutual
[7861.41s -> 7864.05s]  i'm gonna be real what you write out to you
[7864.05s -> 7868.93s]  this blue blue player uh... like i you could tell me that this person
[7868.93s -> 7872.13s]  sniffed glue is a kid and their parents never told them to stop
[7872.13s -> 7874.13s]  and i would believe you
[7874.13s -> 7877.65s]  i'm not even meaning like i would say that makes sense
[7877.65s -> 7881.17s]  i mean i said i don't i don't even care i don't care if it's a girl a guy
[7881.17s -> 7884.37s]  the girl thing is like that doesn't bother me right like it could be a girl a guy a
[7884.37s -> 7891.69s]  Pigeon they could they could fucking they could relate as a fucking peanut in a in a fucking plane
[7891.69s -> 7898.01s]  I don't care about that at all. You know what I mean like said that shit doesn't bother me at all
[7899.19s -> 7903.13s]  Like then be like I actually think it's stupid when people are like oh, it's an e-girl
[7903.13s -> 7907.59s]  You got like I think that's dumb as shit because that argument's so crap
[7908.15s -> 7911.71s]  Because like I don't give a shit if it's a guy or girl because like you know what I mean
[7911.71s -> 7914.95s]  I'm more upset at the fact that this person is delugimally than anything
[7914.95s -> 7928.74s]  Okay, that's like what's tilting me.
[7928.74s -> 7931.02s]  Here, I'm just gonna mute.
[7931.02s -> 7933.46s]  We'll do one more game on this account after this game,
[7933.46s -> 7935.54s]  and I'm gonna mute from the start of the game for you guys.
[7935.54s -> 7942.76s]  Okay?
[7942.76s -> 7945.36s]  Dude, if he didn't actually get me into the wall there,
[7945.36s -> 7948.00s]  I tried to walk forward so that I wouldn't get condemned
[7948.00s -> 7950.68s]  into the wall if he didn't stun me, I kill him.
[7950.68s -> 7951.60s]  Ah, that's annoying.
[7953.08s -> 7955.84s]  That was actually such a good hitbox for him.
[7955.84s -> 7970.73s]  My bad.
[7970.73s -> 7971.57s]  Nice.
[7971.57s -> 7973.09s]  You check down, nice job.
[7973.09s -> 7974.69s]  If you're wondering why I'm even here, by the way,
[7974.69s -> 7976.37s]  I'm actually, I'm not trolling.
[7976.37s -> 7979.45s]  I'm trying to get this turret because this gives me a lot of gold.
[7979.45s -> 7982.13s]  At the moment, I'm not actually worth that much gold.
[7982.13s -> 7983.25s]  There's nothing going on in the map.
[7983.25s -> 7985.25s]  There's no objective or anything like that, right?
[7985.25s -> 7986.93s]  So I'm trying to push in top waves right now
[7986.93s -> 7991.09s]  so that I can get gold to try and like hyper and flight
[7991.09s -> 7993.29s]  might too item before this next dragon.
[7993.29s -> 7995.41s]  Because this next dragon is going to be incredibly important
[7995.41s -> 7998.49s]  if we want any chance to win.
[7998.49s -> 8000.61s]  We have to win this next dragon.
[8000.61s -> 8003.01s]  And the only way for me to do that is to either get
[8003.01s -> 8009.73s]  really lucky or go get some gold in a side win. It's just support difference ever again.
[8009.73s -> 8016.05s]  It is. I want to point this out. This person is playing this victim complex bullshit. Like,
[8016.05s -> 8056.61s]  you know what I mean? But it is. It is actually support. I'm telling you that I'm playing bad
[8056.61s -> 8061.65s]  this game. I need to mute these players because these players are actually tilting me.
[8063.33s -> 8066.21s]  But I was fined with it before, but I'm actually giving it a little irritated and that's
[8066.21s -> 8069.81s]  make me play bad. So I need to move them so I don't keep in
[8069.81s -> 8075.19s]  tink. Like it's affecting my gameplay and it's pissing me off.
[8075.19s -> 8090.21s]  That's just my bad. Tees what? Are you here? Tees? Yo, Tees. Message to the
[8090.21s -> 8095.53s]  Slurgo. I mean this in the nicest way. I don't even want to be toxic. I
[8095.53s -> 8102.23s]  genuinely want to use this for content. Like this guy's been flaming me the
[8102.23s -> 8107.11s]  whole game. Like I want to use this for content to show you guys that it is so
[8107.11s -> 8112.39s]  easy to tell people how the game should be played. So easy if you if you can communicate
[8112.39s -> 8120.01s]  by talking. Because this guy's been doing nothing but flaming me the entire game. This
[8120.01s -> 8125.45s]  will look right. But he's an absolute like he played the lane completely bad. Then
[8125.45s -> 8130.65s]  he then he stopped trying to win. Stop shielding me, stop doing anything right after
[8130.65s -> 8136.11s]  he played the lane bad. Then he started playing the victim thing when I asked him to be
[8136.11s -> 8139.83s]  a human and like come over and like help me and play teamwork. You get him or I didn't
[8139.83s -> 8144.63s]  wait my single time right like I didn't say a single negative thing to this guy in game I said let's work as a team
[8145.35s -> 8150.77s]  He got upset
[8150.77s -> 8156.77s]  Like I genuinely think it'd be great content if I could talk to this guy in discord and just like oh, I'd be so good
[8173.64s -> 8176.92s]  I do I'm I'm trying to kill these people guys
[8179.38s -> 8184.26s]  That wasn't bad though. We got 800 gold not the worst, but I don't know if my team can stall this
[8185.30s -> 8187.30s]  Maybe thinking like kill this they can stall it, but
[8187.30s -> 8194.20s]  but no, that's GG.
[8194.20s -> 8196.20s]  That was disgusting to all of you.
[8234.36s -> 8236.96s]  I'm gonna add him and he'll probably not add me,
[8236.96s -> 8241.23s]  but I might as well try.
[8241.23s -> 8252.27s]  This would be such a good warning experience.
[8252.27s -> 8253.71s]  Oh, excuse me.
[8253.71s -> 8255.39s]  Dude, I've had like bad heartburn today.
[8255.39s -> 8262.61s]  I need to take one of those heartburn pills.
[8262.61s -> 8264.41s]  What, what, what, what, man?
[8264.41s -> 8266.49s]  Just say it, it's what it out.
[8266.49s -> 8271.45s]  What about, let it out, baby.
[8271.45s -> 8275.44s]  Yo, what do we do?
[8275.44s -> 8287.73s]  let's just have a talk. Yo, let's discord. We can bother with you. Since I'm so bad,
[8290.87s -> 8311.99s]  yep, trust you, you just blamed everyone, put yourself, but you didn't play correctly at all.
[8311.99s -> 8326.34s]  You played land completely wrong. Didn't help each other. Left people to die on repeats.
[8326.34s -> 8369.70s]  Then played a victim. I genuinely want to help you. This guy screenshot it, what I just said,
[8369.70s -> 8386.50s]  and put it in the end game chat. What is happening right now? What is going on?
[8386.50s -> 8406.82s]  there is no way that this is not an NPC. There is no way. This is not an NPC. There's no way.
[8406.82s -> 8423.00s]  There's no way. It's Geronimo of a Mal. It is me. Yes. Bro, just come talk in discord. I'm not even going to
[8423.00s -> 8438.31s]  flame you. What does this even mean? Bro, I don't think I've seen anybody more insecure
[8438.31s -> 8451.75s]  in my life. Bro, you are so insecure. It's cringe. How insecure you are. Like,
[8451.75s -> 8452.59s]  Oof.
[8453.83s -> 8458.23s]  Go back, man, on the climb to masters, but
[8459.63s -> 8467.96s]  Jesus Christ, that's sad.
[8467.96s -> 8471.60s]  Oh God, I, dude, I don't even know what to say.
[8471.60s -> 8473.04s]  Like, I'll be real.
[8473.04s -> 8475.36s]  I was, like, I'm not even gonna flame the guy, right?
[8475.36s -> 8479.36s]  I just genuinely want to like, improves the community.
[8481.00s -> 8483.60s]  Because that was three straight supports in a row.
[8483.60s -> 8485.76s]  They didn't know how to play Lulu.
[8485.76s -> 8488.16s]  And I'm not even gonna flame the guy's skill.
[8488.16s -> 8489.20s]  He's not a Lulu player, right?
[8489.20s -> 8491.20s]  He doesn't play Lulu, that's fine.
[8491.20s -> 8494.80s]  But the issue was that I had with that guy specifically,
[8494.80s -> 8499.28s]  was that it's okay to be bad at the game, right?
[8499.28s -> 8500.80s]  There's nothing wrong with being bad at league.
[8500.80s -> 8502.24s]  Everybody has bad games.
[8502.24s -> 8504.12s]  But when we're playing a game together,
[8504.12s -> 8505.24s]  and you're saying it's winnable,
[8505.24s -> 8506.44s]  and you wanna win the game,
[8506.44s -> 8511.08s]  you can't pick and choose who to help win the game.
[8512.00s -> 8513.88s]  Like if I'm sitting there bot lane,
[8513.88s -> 8516.96s]  we're both being dove by Jen and you're intentionally
[8516.96s -> 8519.84s]  trying not to take damage and not die
[8519.84s -> 8524.12s]  because you want to value your KDA over everything else
[8524.12s -> 8528.56s]  so that I you know what hold on let me think about this
[8528.56s -> 8531.80s]  I think I figured this person out
[8531.80s -> 8533.56s]  this person lives in delusion
[8533.56s -> 8536.68s]  and I think I figured this out let me explain this a lot of players do this
[8536.68s -> 8540.20s]  but I think I'm figuring this out as I'm thinking about this
[8540.20s -> 8542.20s]  so
[8542.20s -> 8544.80s]  This person has really good KDAs on the profile, right?
[8544.80s -> 8546.52s]  This is like this eye catching person.
[8546.52s -> 8549.40s]  They've really, really good KDAs on the profile, right?
[8549.40s -> 8552.20s]  This person doesn't ever take risks.
[8552.20s -> 8556.00s]  Doesn't ever do anything to try and win the game outside
[8556.00s -> 8561.02s]  of like just the existing and hitting buttons.
[8561.02s -> 8564.78s]  And what they do is they will always have good KDAs
[8564.78s -> 8566.90s]  and they will sit here and never like,
[8566.90s -> 8568.58s]  I know why they're losing.
[8568.58s -> 8570.06s]  They will sit here and they will do the shit
[8570.06s -> 8571.10s]  where they have good KDAs.
[8571.10s -> 8574.10s]  They don't ever die that much, blah, blah, blah.
[8574.10s -> 8577.22s]  But what they do is they lie to themselves and they say,
[8577.22s -> 8579.54s]  look how good my KDAs are.
[8579.54s -> 8585.06s]  If I had better teammates, I'd always win.
[8585.06s -> 8589.06s]  Like, I cracked the code, actually.
[8589.06s -> 8590.90s]  That's totally what it is.
[8590.90s -> 8594.82s]  The players actually play so safe and they play
[8594.82s -> 8596.94s]  to like, for statistics, right?
[8596.94s -> 8599.50s]  They play like purely for the stats.
[8599.50s -> 8602.42s]  And then they can say that it was their teams fault
[8602.42s -> 8606.62s]  that they didn't win because they played really bad.
[8606.62s -> 8612.60s]  but they didn't die.
[8612.60s -> 8613.96s]  Because I mean, in theory,
[8613.96s -> 8618.00s]  I could have a perfect KDA on every 80 carry I play.
[8618.00s -> 8620.56s]  All I have to do is literally walk up,
[8620.56s -> 8622.32s]  get one kill, and then AFK
[8622.32s -> 8625.76s]  and stand in the base of the rest of the game.
[8625.76s -> 8626.24s]  And I could be like,
[8626.24s -> 8627.64s]  yo, why's my team not able to carry?
[8627.64s -> 8631.43s]  What's happening?
[8631.43s -> 8632.43s]  Right?
[8632.43s -> 8633.99s]  Like, you could literally do that.
[8633.99s -> 8637.99s]  No, I seriously think the person's self-gaslighting himself.
[8637.99s -> 8638.99s]  Like, I'm serious.
[8638.99s -> 8640.91s]  I think this person's self-gaslighting,
[8640.91s -> 8644.19s]  where they're like, oh, it's my team's fault every game.
[8644.19s -> 8646.91s]  They're always blaming their team for their loses
[8646.91s -> 8648.31s]  and then mistakes and shit.
[8648.31s -> 8651.75s]  And it's sad because like, there's a reason you're D2.
[8651.75s -> 8653.19s]  And I'm not saying that to be toxic.
[8653.19s -> 8655.91s]  I'm saying that like, you haven't improved in four years.
[8655.91s -> 8657.43s]  And you haven't improved because all you're doing
[8657.43s -> 8659.75s]  is playing to blame your team every single game.
[8659.75s -> 8661.87s]  When I just saw like 500 mistakes
[8661.87s -> 8671.64s]  that you made that we could have won the game off of early game.
[8671.64s -> 8673.40s]  Here, I remember somebody wanted me to play a cake.
[8673.40s -> 8676.60s]  When game last game, so we're gonna play cake.
[8677.80s -> 8679.60s]  I don't remember who it was in the chat.
[8679.60s -> 8685.20s]  Somebody's like two people said Kate, but we'll do a cake game for you guys. I got you guys. Don't worry
[8702.93s -> 8709.17s]  All right, I'm gonna take Ghost Flash because they have three mad at champs four mad at champs. They've they've were consed
[8709.17s -> 8711.41s]  Claed Gregus, so I'm gonna take Ghost Flash
[8713.01s -> 8718.09s]  These are gonna be my runes this game. I'm gonna take a little more MR because I don't think we're gonna be fighting too much in lane
[8718.33s -> 8721.49s]  We're pretty much just gonna be poking them with comic Kate
[8722.17s -> 8725.97s]  So I'm gonna take a little bit extra MR because I'm gonna be playing for mid delay game. I'm just scaling
[8726.85s -> 8740.37s]  And these are going to be the ruins that I take, even cause I'm 80 carry or the easier to play once.
[8740.37s -> 8745.37s]  And 80 carry, I usually do like, when I'm playing on this account right now, this is like my teaching accounts.
[8745.37s -> 8749.37s]  It's a little lower and more, right? It's like D1 low masters.
[8749.37s -> 8754.37s]  I usually play 80 carries that like the chat wants to see me play.
[8754.37s -> 8758.37s]  So that you guys can learn like good and bad matchups and things like that.
[8758.37s -> 8764.77s]  The last two games I got way too tilted by shitty support players like egos and all that shit
[8764.77s -> 8768.23s]  I got way too frustrated and I played bad the last two games so we're gonna
[8768.97s -> 8771.73s]  Honestly, I think I'm just gonna mute these people with a very start of the game
[8772.29s -> 8777.27s]  Normally I wouldn't suggest you move people because like playing as a team is really important
[8778.45s -> 8782.11s]  Because like you know you need to communicate in all that shit, but I am just like I'm gonna mute them
[8783.73s -> 8785.25s]  Because I
[8785.25s -> 8789.51s]  Dude my mental is taking a fucking hit right now, so we're gonna just chill and play
[8789.51s -> 8798.31s]  I just don't know how to play Naba. I think that was really good. I just don't I don't know how to play her
[8799.83s -> 8806.40s]  I think she's a great champ like I've been getting shit on by Nila on my main account
[8807.72s -> 8822.52s]  Like a lot of grandmaster Naba's have been dumbstring me. I think she's just really good at abusing solo queue
[8823.52s -> 8828.28s]  Like the issue with Nila is from what I've seen all the losses I've had with Nila
[8828.28s -> 8833.72s]  people don't it's like the thing I was telling you about before people don't play
[8833.72s -> 8838.36s]  aggressively in the lower E-Los like even in Grandmaster people don't play
[8838.36s -> 8841.96s]  like aggressively enough it sounds crazy to say that but it's true they don't
[8841.96s -> 8844.96s]  play aggressively enough in Wayne so you can get away with just picking Nila and
[8844.96s -> 8849.88s]  scaling and Nila at like one item you'll always be up in levels right because
[8849.88s -> 8854.08s]  that's how the champion works the champion works in like you'll always be
[8854.08s -> 8860.84s]  up in levels because of her passive. So you basically just like scale through existing.
[8860.84s -> 8863.84s]  It's pretty, it's pretty interesting.
[8863.84s -> 8871.37s]  Alright, so we're playing Kate Karma. Oh, I missed them in here because I suck.
[8871.37s -> 8874.37s]  I'm going to ward this bush.
[8874.37s -> 8883.74s]  Just because I don't want the recon in the bush.
[8883.74s -> 8887.74s]  So now that the bush isn't warding anymore, um, okay, warding nice.
[8887.74s -> 8893.24s]  As you can say, what I want to do is I actually want to play, I suck.
[8893.24s -> 8900.48s]  I actually wanted to play a whole man. I'm so bad at Kate. I wanted to play on the top side of the wave so that I'm not standing near the bushes, right?
[8900.98s -> 8902.98s]  Because if you stand near the bushes
[8903.76s -> 8908.20s]  The recon can obviously like W me and I just get fucked, so I'd rather play in a safer spot
[8909.52s -> 8911.52s]  Can't wait I missed two cms. I'm so fucking bad
[8912.36s -> 8916.62s]  Now I want to push in wave three and I want to go by a call. So I'm gonna ping to push
[8917.24s -> 8929.58s]  Okay, so I actually want to back here and I'm gonna go by a call
[8929.58s -> 8937.22s]  So, this is called a cheater recall, you usually have perfect C.S. to back on this timer,
[8937.22s -> 8942.90s]  go and you can go back a call, okay? This is like something that you can do if you're in a
[8942.90s -> 8946.70s]  lane that's going to be permish on. So what happens is the reason that's called the cheater recall
[8946.70s -> 8956.51s]  is because we push the wave in, they had to stay and farm the wave, right? Now watch. They
[8956.51s -> 8960.61s]  have to push this wave in, right? Now if karma was here instead of roaming, this
[8960.61s -> 8963.81s]  from is fine by the way, but if she was here instead of roaming, she could actually hold
[8963.81s -> 8970.01s]  the wave. And if you notice here, I don't actually miss that many minions, right? We're
[8970.01s -> 8980.57s]  chilling. Now we can so push this or safe. I should actually fast push this because I
[8980.57s -> 8986.21s]  wanted to bounce. I don't want to so push this, but I can't I can't fast push this at
[8986.21s -> 8994.25s]  level three by myself. So we're just going to chill.
[8994.25s -> 9000.59s]  Hey, man's really good at abusing like early lane phase bullying just based on like what our kit does
[9000.87s -> 9003.45s]  We see we're con on the map top side to get you see that's
[9004.45s -> 9011.17s]  So because we see we're con I can walk up a bit and we could play a little aggro here
[9011.53s -> 9022.16s]  You can kind of see like I don't have to play behind the minion wave. You see what I'm doing to this guy, right?
[9022.16s -> 9034.09s]  I hate this game we can quit we can we can four foot. It's fun. I hate this game. I hate I really hate this game
[9034.09s -> 9036.09s]  Dude, what is wrong with me right now?
[9036.09s -> 9038.09s]  It's like my brain doesn't work.
[9038.09s -> 9042.42s]  It's the 280 Kater. Telling you.
[9042.42s -> 9048.74s]  So, Rekon's gonna be bought right now.
[9048.74s -> 9051.74s]  I know he's gonna be bought.
[9051.74s -> 9053.74s]  So, I need to be a little care.
[9053.74s -> 9056.74s]  Now, my karma is here.
[9056.74s -> 9059.95s]  There we go.
[9059.95s -> 9060.95s]  So, you know, so I didn't use any spells.
[9060.95s -> 9065.54s]  I'm not, I'm just chilling.
[9065.54s -> 9066.54s]  Dude.
[9066.54s -> 9068.54s]  Are you kidding me, man?
[9068.54s -> 9072.24s]  I'm gonna be honest.
[9072.24s -> 9074.24s]  I'm getting really tilted by these players now.
[9074.24s -> 9080.40s]  Like the Recon W's in, they just stand there and watch me die.
[9080.40s -> 9082.80s]  Okay, it's fine.
[9082.80s -> 9084.28s]  Listen, I'm not going to get too mad about it.
[9084.28s -> 9085.28s]  It's fine.
[9085.28s -> 9088.26s]  I should have flashed the knock-up, I guess, even though in reality, I should never
[9088.26s -> 9092.92s]  have to flash the knock-up, but I should have flashed it because I can't trust the teammates.
[9092.92s -> 9095.88s]  So what I'm saying is right there, Carmen and Fiddler were both right here.
[9095.88s -> 9097.48s]  I was being chased down.
[9097.48s -> 9098.48s]  They stood here.
[9098.48s -> 9100.40s]  They didn't walk up to do anything.
[9100.40s -> 9103.16s]  They just stood and waited.
[9103.16s -> 9110.92s]  pisses me off because I hate when players play selfish and scared it's my biggest pet peeve
[9113.85s -> 9124.04s]  it drives me fucking crazy man. Sorry I'm getting I'm losing my mind like it's so easy
[9126.50s -> 9142.54s]  it's fine though I shouldn't have walked up and ego to it's on me. I want to so push this way
[9148.79s -> 9157.03s]  I'm losing it. This by the way would be the example of a bad time for coming to Rome
[9157.03s -> 9164.14s]  She needs to come back bot. There's absolutely no reason for her to roam on that timer
[9165.06s -> 9169.78s]  There's also no reason for her to be in that bush over there. We should be playing up to try it. We're playing Kate Karma, right?
[9170.18s -> 9172.70s]  We should be playing forward so that we can actually be aggressive
[9173.66s -> 9176.78s]  Kate Karma's a wane bully line. We don't want to sit here and just do nothing
[9176.78s -> 9180.74s]  If you pick Karma you want to be aggressive you want to be playing up. You want to be stunning
[9180.74s -> 9182.94s]  You want to be doing like aggressive things playing the game
[9183.38s -> 9189.01s]  We're all about six. I'd really like to like go in. Yeah, like
[9189.01s -> 9202.01s]  that was actually not bad by the karma she w the zia and then I got to trap off of it so that wasn't too bad
[9203.29s -> 9224.14s]  Not the worst not not bad that was good. That was good
[9225.38s -> 9243.75s]  Really nice really nice. Okay, so I'm gonna back here cuz I don't want to overstay for the way and I'm gonna grab boots
[9247.74s -> 9253.14s]  You don't think a lot of it is to I think a lot of it is people get really scared when they like
[9253.14s -> 9258.46s]  Recon is really strong in this meta right like he's very very powerful. He is like numbers are a little too high right now
[9258.46s -> 9260.46s]  So like everything he does is just a little too good
[9260.66s -> 9266.22s]  So I think people get nervous around Recon especially with Ziya because it's like when people would get nervous around Nami-Ocean
[9266.22s -> 9269.22s]  The lane like plays itself. It's very strong. It's very hard to beat
[9269.58s -> 9273.70s]  But you can still see people making mistakes when they play the lane so you gotta watch for that type of stuff
[9280.01s -> 9289.21s]  Now a good way to play against a Ziya once you hit six is you don't want to
[9289.21s -> 9297.21s]  You don't want to ever walk melee range of her or give her the ability to just kill you with the feathers.
[9297.21s -> 9303.21s]  Your main goal here is going to be, try and stay in a good spot when it comes to feathers.
[9303.21s -> 9308.21s]  I want to be to the side of her. The side of her is the best option, where she can't pull in.
[9308.21s -> 9312.97s]  I'll get hit by maybe a few, but she can't pull in all of them.
[9312.97s -> 9316.97s]  That's a really key thing when playing versus her.
[9316.97s -> 9320.33s]  back in the day. I didn't know how to play Versailles and I would always get fucking frost right at this shit.
[9321.13s -> 9326.81s]  So Recon's 5. I wanted to have C Recon's 5. We shouldn't be able to die here.
[9329.67s -> 9333.99s]  I want to push this wave in, but I also need to stay away from where the Recon can be.
[9335.94s -> 9338.26s]  So if you want to push Wave Stain in and reset the wave,
[9340.18s -> 9343.94s]  make sure that you're standing as far away as you can from where they can engage on you.
[9349.03s -> 9353.75s]  Now they're about to be 6 Recon is. So they have a really strong level 6. She has pickaxe and Nune Quiver.
[9353.75s -> 9356.71s]  We do want to be a little hesitant here. We don't want to fight
[9358.15s -> 9360.71s]  Now I'm gonna kind of push the Senate bit
[9361.51s -> 9366.95s]  We should have been spam pushing the whole wave because that's how K-Carmac players we just push push push
[9367.83s -> 9371.35s]  But we played that that early Rome by Carmo
[9372.55s -> 9374.55s]  Kind of put us behind on that
[9375.27s -> 9379.27s]  It's not a big deal. It's just something that we have to adjust
[9382.98s -> 9385.54s]  Why does this say 88 and this say 90?
[9385.54s -> 9410.95s]  which one is it? Is it 88 or 90? I mean that guy's dead. I don't know what that
[9410.95s -> 9420.94s]  karma's thinking but we probably have to give this trick. I mean maybe we could
[9420.94s -> 9431.32s]  fight it if it'll have all teeth but he'm not having all the others no way. The
[9431.32s -> 9438.36s]  higher one counts ward kills. Why? I think that's so stupid. So they might
[9438.36s -> 9444.52s]  try and engage here. Unless they somehow know fettles in the bush which would be
[9444.52s -> 9449.85s]  impressive because we know it's not worded. So that'd be pretty impressive if they knew that.
[9464.17s -> 9479.18s]  We could actually refts. I'm just gonna ghost. This is crazy. What the fuck?
[9480.14s -> 9488.76s]  Oh, this is interesting. They saw Fed a hundred percent. Yeah, I don't know where though. It must
[9488.76s -> 9498.22s]  it because he used this thing. But I'll use this uh, whatever it's called. His effigy. I'd have to go look.
[9502.42s -> 9508.28s]  One minion. Oh, I guess I didn't sit. I should back. I can get dove here.
[9508.28s -> 9512.44s]  We don't know where Greg is. Like if Greg is happens to be like he is over this wall or something
[9513.00s -> 9515.88s]  I can get down really easy. I'm greeting really hard
[9517.16s -> 9519.16s]  Breeding usually gets you killed
[9519.16s -> 9520.84s]  Typically I
[9520.84s -> 9527.48s]  Shouldn't be doing this they're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right?
[9528.36s -> 9530.04s]  It's like
[9530.04s -> 9536.20s]  If you know something's gonna be a bad habit you should not do it just cue the bush
[9538.04s -> 9540.20s]  Okay, that was I meant use like an actual cue
[9540.20s -> 9546.60s]  They could also be in the alcove, so my little hesitant, but that's fine.
[9546.60s -> 9556.88s]  Okay, so the reason I stayed was because now I have my, I have my method, correct?
[9556.88s -> 9561.88s]  Because we finished the coal, and we finished the method at the same time, or finished the wave, so.
[9561.88s -> 9566.88s]  Now I have two options. I go Gailforce here, to dodge a lot of their shits,
[9566.88s -> 9570.88s]  or I can do what sounds like a fun option.
[9570.88s -> 9573.88s]  We're gonna do shield though.
[9573.88s -> 9577.28s]  I'm going to show you guys why I like shield bow on Caitlyn.
[9577.28s -> 9584.04s]  It's not the best mythic but it's good into certain comps.
[9584.04s -> 9589.00s]  If you don't want to get, uh, yeah.
[9589.00s -> 9593.00s]  Because I have a lacquer to do this game, I don't have bloodline, right?
[9593.00s -> 9603.67s]  So I kind of want to go shield bow and then I'm going to end up going, uh, either i.e.
[9603.67s -> 9612.55s]  Or I'm going, like, bloodthirsty seconds, i.e. or b.t.
[9612.55s -> 9625.02s]  probably I eat just because I think it's actually easier to go I eat this game by
[9625.02s -> 9626.02s]  app.
[9626.02s -> 9627.02s]  This is a kind of boring game.
[9627.02s -> 9637.26s]  Our teams don't really well though, so we just chill.
[9637.26s -> 9638.98s]  We gotta be able to care.
[9638.98s -> 9655.70s]  Okay.
[9655.70s -> 9658.10s]  It was kind of hard to do anything there.
[9658.10s -> 9661.74s]  Even though I got a few autos on the Gragas, it's a little difficult to actually play
[9661.74s -> 9667.54s]  the game there.
[9667.54s -> 9670.06s]  Because if I walk up too far, like see, we're concert.
[9670.06s -> 9672.62s]  If I walk up too far, I just get killed by Rakan.
[9672.62s -> 9680.04s]  Alright, I'm just gonna reset and go get boots.
[9680.04s -> 9689.04s]  Basically, any carry is really fucking boring in games like this, where you can't really blow the game open.
[9689.04s -> 9697.53s]  Oh, I'm dead. Maybe? Wait, karma shielded me? I'm not dead.
[9697.53s -> 9700.74s]  Nice.
[9700.74s -> 9701.74s]  Fuck!
[9721.06s -> 9723.06s]  Motivucker COVID me, Matt.
[9723.06s -> 9724.06s]  There's like, go.
[9724.06s -> 9727.94s]  We can fight this though. They have no ults.
[9727.94s -> 9737.35s]  Like, this is actually fightable. They have no XIRR and no...
[9737.35s -> 9746.09s]  Ragnar and this is also why it's really important that you relate to your team the cooldowns of your team
[9746.95s -> 9752.63s]  Remember that don't forget that if somebody uses a big cooldown tell your team because that was an illegal dragon
[9752.63s -> 9756.59s]  Right like they just that was one of the most illegal things I've seen in the wild
[9757.55s -> 9784.94s]  Homey completely grief that that's another very very very important thing that you need to take away from playing league and being like is the one I was saying about a team work and shit earlier
[9784.94s -> 9789.94s]  being good at the game is a lot of spreading knowledge as well, right?
[9789.94s -> 9795.94s]  Like, if you, if your team doesn't know if a flash is up or down, you have to play completely differently, right?
[9795.94s -> 9798.94s]  Like, you got to think about the game and that in terms of that as well.
[9798.94s -> 9801.94s]  Like, how many times have you seen like, you know, you're like, oh, I can walk up here.
[9801.94s -> 9803.94s]  If this guy can't flash out, may or something, right?
[9803.94s -> 9809.23s]  It happens all the time.
[9809.23s -> 9814.02s]  Well, if I can kill a dusk blade, that's it.
[9814.02s -> 9815.02s]  I don't know.
[9815.02s -> 9820.85s]  I probably could.
[9820.85s -> 9832.22s]  Uh, I should go mad.
[9832.22s -> 9838.19s]  What do you think about Timo and other top one as AD carry?
[9838.19s -> 9843.62s]  I play Timo AD carry when I'm playing for fun sometimes.
[9843.62s -> 9845.10s]  It's okay.
[9845.10s -> 9856.51s]  Yo go look on your game man.
[9856.51s -> 9860.63s]  So during the mid game is Caitlyn, a few things that I can kind of teach you.
[9860.63s -> 9862.27s]  This was kind of a boring lane phase, right?
[9862.27s -> 9864.31s]  Like we didn't really do that much.
[9864.31s -> 9868.59s]  The lane phase was essentially just like we died once and then you know everything all
[9868.59s -> 9870.43s]  help broke loose.
[9870.43s -> 9874.31s]  When you're walk up the fights like this, make sure that you're putting traps down.
[9874.31s -> 9888.14s]  in places where the enemy has to walk. Just like that's. Plain, playing Caitlin is not always
[9888.14s -> 9892.54s]  about just like autoing and getting cues and shits. If you noticed during that fight, I put
[9892.54s -> 9897.34s]  two traps here, two traps here. I forced the enemy team into like a location where they had to eat
[9897.34s -> 9908.60s]  traps or they they can't find us, right? And even if like they've void the traps, they're still
[9908.60s -> 9914.44s]  having to like move their character in a very unique specific way that they probably don't want to do.
[9918.23s -> 9922.87s]  So you should always be thinking, where should I put these traps down at the start of fight not like how do I get autos off?
[9922.87s -> 9928.31s]  Think about using your traps to zone and that I control the team fight before the fight starts rather than using it to
[9929.67s -> 9932.95s]  Do damage because that they'll step in the traps themselves
[9933.99s -> 9937.83s]  People will just people are stupid. They're bad people are paying attention
[9938.63s -> 9940.63s]  Everything I'm bad
[9940.63s -> 9946.87s]  You know what I mean people can't pay attention to every bush that you're putting traps in during a big fight. It's it's too much attention span
[9946.87s -> 9964.46s]  Nobody has it. Nice.
[9964.46s -> 9969.97s]  Oh, big tip for all the 80 carries in chat, guys.
[9969.97s -> 9971.97s]  I'm going to tell you right now.
[9971.97s -> 9974.97s]  Once the 20 minute mark happens in league,
[9974.97s -> 9977.97s]  your junglers camps are no longer his.
[9977.97s -> 9980.97s]  I know. I know junglers are going to hate me for this, okay?
[9980.97s -> 9983.97s]  Listen, if you're a jungle player, you're like, fuck this guy now, I hate him.
[9983.97s -> 9987.97s]  Listen, you know it's true. You know at 20 minutes, your camps no longer,
[9987.97s -> 9989.97s]  like, they're not yours anymore, man.
[9989.97s -> 9995.19s]  Okay, like you you you are full items at this point. Okay, like I want to be honest
[9995.39s -> 9997.57s]  You would I'm taking your camps
[9997.57s -> 10002.90s]  I'm trying to get my third item as fast as humanly possible
[10010.39s -> 10024.43s]  Because 80 carries spike on three items extremely hard and I want to walk top, but we have no vision of this area, so it's a little scary
[10024.99s -> 10030.68s]  Like I said I typically don't like to take
[10031.48s -> 10033.48s]  jungles camps early game ever
[10033.48s -> 10039.48s]  Because like, that's why I say like at 20 minutes, usually you have two items at this point.
[10039.48s -> 10042.48s]  If you're like farming decent, etc.
[10042.48s -> 10046.48s]  Sometimes it'll be faster, but usually it's around average of like you'll have your items at this point.
[10046.48s -> 10073.46s]  Always be tabbing to the teamfights even if you're farming as well.
[10073.46s -> 10079.46s]  That is in this bush.
[10079.46s -> 10080.46s]  Wait, where is he?
[10080.46s -> 10082.46s]  Wait, I'm stupid, where do you go?
[10082.46s -> 10085.46s]  Oh, he died, I killed him.
[10085.46s -> 10092.99s]  Wow, I'm really smart.
[10092.99s -> 10096.91s]  I like didn't notice that I killed that guy. I'm so dumb
[10102.68s -> 10111.16s]  80 carry brand right boys. I was like playing that so scared too because I was like I was like is he there?
[10112.50s -> 10122.98s]  Pull the dragon out
[10123.86s -> 10128.50s]  Oh, I asked this yesterday, but what do you guys think the cool is looking dragon is I swear it's the
[10130.10s -> 10132.10s]  I think Mountain Drake looks fucking sick
[10168.66s -> 10171.78s]  Welcome to the series. I'm like I'm the pushman, right?
[10171.78s -> 10173.78s]  Jera hype.
[10173.78s -> 10178.94s]  That's mainly because we our karma just got picked off.
[10178.94s -> 10182.34s]  And I don't want to give them the option of pushing the wave.
[10182.34s -> 10204.04s]  So by pushing the lane, nice.
[10204.04s -> 10208.60s]  By pushing the lane in, it takes away an option for the enemy.
[10208.60s -> 10210.76s]  That's something that a lot of people think like, oh, I just want farm.
[10210.76s -> 10212.04s]  I don't care about the farm, right?
[10212.04s -> 10215.80s]  Like when I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game,
[10215.80s -> 10219.20s]  and I'm pushing like a mid way of in before a fight,
[10219.20s -> 10221.40s]  If we're just seeding around the barren,
[10221.40s -> 10225.64s]  having that wave pushed in, gives them, gives us another option
[10225.64s -> 10227.84s]  unlike what we can do in the game.
[10227.84s -> 10229.56s]  And it takes you three seconds to push in.
[10229.56s -> 10234.64s]  So if the fights are already over, and you have time,
[10234.64s -> 10237.88s]  always be paying attention to like trying to push in waves
[10237.88s -> 10241.04s]  so that you can create a little bit of that pressure.
[10241.04s -> 10244.12s]  Yo, hail, thank you so much for the 14 man, walk it back.
[10244.12s -> 10245.00s]  What do I get next?
[10245.00s -> 10251.69s]  I kind of want to get BT, I'm going to get BT.
[10251.69s -> 10256.49s]  I could get donms, but I think BT's better because the I already have over here, right?
[10256.49s -> 10260.81s]  So the shield from BT plus shield vote plus I, I don't think I'll be able to die.
[10261.21s -> 10262.17s]  Like I think I'm uncalable.
[10263.05s -> 10265.13s]  Act actually, like actually uncalable.
[10266.17s -> 10269.37s]  So here, I'm gonna actually give these camps the federal because he's literally pathing to them.
[10269.37s -> 10270.49s]  I don't want to be an asshole, but.
[10286.12s -> 10286.60s]  Wow.
[10287.16s -> 10288.12s]  What just happened?
[10288.52s -> 10289.08s]  I'm bad.
[10290.68s -> 10293.00s]  I feel like I got hooked by clad.
[10293.00s -> 10296.00s]  Oh, he flashed.
[10296.00s -> 10297.00s]  Okay.
[10297.00s -> 10302.00s]  I was like, I feel like what just happened was like, I missed position because I went up here,
[10302.00s -> 10305.00s]  like I ghosted one up here, because there was two people here, two people here.
[10305.00s -> 10307.00s]  I put traps down these kind of sloppy traps.
[10307.00s -> 10312.00s]  And then I positioned here and then clad flashed, queued me under the, yeah, okay, that makes sense.
[10312.00s -> 10316.14s]  I'm just bad.
[10316.14s -> 10322.65s]  It was okay though, because if the entire enemy team has to literally,
[10322.65s -> 10328.87s]  and
[10328.87s -> 10331.19s]  my double flash on you to kill you under the turret and then your team follows up it's not that big of a deal
[10331.19s -> 10334.63s]  get a force what a save me there though actually
[10334.63s -> 10339.52s]  okay
[10339.52s -> 10341.78s]  get a force totally was a bit
[10341.78s -> 10342.68s]  because he has
[10342.68s -> 10345.95s]  serpents
[10345.95s -> 10353.39s]  serpents definitely chits on chobo I'm kind of stupid for going to show by this game
[10353.39s -> 10356.39s]  I wanted to try it out because I when I before when I was playing Caitlyn
[10356.39s -> 10358.87s]  Before the IE reworking everything everybody would go
[10359.87s -> 10366.11s]  Or there was like one guy in Challenger would go shield bow into shit every aim and I wanted to see if like it was still liable
[10366.11s -> 10368.63s]  But there might just be better options now like always scale force
[10369.67s -> 10382.55s]  BT or something. Oh my god. I flashed late. I'm dead. Dude. I flashed late for some reason. I'm so dumb
[10383.31s -> 10385.31s]  My bad
[10385.31s -> 10391.71s]  I was gonna envy my brain. It's moving slowly like I can feel it turning
[10391.83s -> 10426.24s]  I'm just playing bad, like I was baiting the clad to go in on me because Karma was there, but what I need to do is I need to trap on top myself when he goes in, then I need to flash net, and the clad just does. You can also just kill him, I was gonna say, they have nothing, we just play for dragon here. I don't know why I'm playing so bad today. I play bad yesterday too, I don't know what's going on.
[10426.24s -> 10444.85s]  My brain is broken.
[10444.85s -> 10446.85s]  Dude, there were convestrags so hard.
[10482.45s -> 10484.45s]  Oh, I've made so many mistakes this game.
[10484.45s -> 10492.79s]  I fucked up positioning mechanic, farm, all kinds of shit.
[10492.79s -> 10502.03s]  Ah, I still don't want our domes, actually.
[10502.03s -> 10509.69s]  I don't think our domes is good this game.
[10509.69s -> 10513.13s]  Like, they have no armor.
[10513.13s -> 10515.13s]  Like, cletters and booktreads.
[10515.13s -> 10518.13s]  Which I feel like,
[10518.13s -> 10521.13s]  really bad indoor team, but
[10521.13s -> 10534.90s]  But oh, a little tip that you guys can have for Caitlyn too when you are
[10536.00s -> 10543.38s]  Like barren's up in in 50 seconds, all right, so a little thing you can do that's actually kind of fun is you want to be at the objective before the like
[10543.84s -> 10548.28s]  Rule with them one of the objectives coming up you always want to be on that side of the map before the before the objective comes up
[10549.20s -> 10552.56s]  But you can put down traps
[10553.76s -> 10555.76s]  In the bushes
[10555.76s -> 10559.40s]  Around the objectives and people will face Jacob and you can just one tap on my game
[10559.68s -> 10566.78s]  it's actually incredibly fun
[10566.78s -> 10569.78s]  but you just put them in the corners of the bushes where people have to walk
[10569.78s -> 10578.32s]  like right here I can put it right between the turret
[10578.32s -> 10591.36s]  I don't know why I didn't ghost
[10591.36s -> 10594.36s]  I'll be honest I have no idea why I didn't ghost
[10594.36s -> 10598.69s]  I was like saving it for something
[10598.69s -> 10599.69s]  I'm not sure what
[10599.69s -> 10604.45s]  next year a birthday present
[10604.45s -> 10605.45s]  if you're the fuck knows
[10605.45s -> 10611.36s]  I could have one shot that guy if I was better at Kate
[10611.36s -> 10615.36s]  I did a really classic combo right there
[10615.36s -> 10621.70s]  Q because I'm bad. I should have when he hit the trap your two headshots sit on him for a few seconds
[10621.70s -> 10625.62s]  So what I should have done is I should have instantly Qed on top of the trap then auto auto and he would have died
[10626.18s -> 10631.22s]  Because your Q does the max damage when they're trapped too, so it would have been like just a perfect three shot
[10631.86s -> 10633.38s]  But I said I
[10633.38s -> 10636.26s]  Don't like hate enough and my muscle memories kind of trash sometimes, so
[10637.78s -> 10653.54s]  That's my bed. Oh, we're getting clotted. I don't know where he is, but I
[10671.12s -> 10672.12s]  Shouldn't have done that. I'm
[10672.12s -> 10679.21s]  I'm women testing really hard right now. I suggest you guys don't limit test. Well, I
[10679.21s -> 10682.09s]  should I do think you should limit test, but not if you want to win like play
[10682.09s -> 10685.49s]  safer, like right there the play wasn't to go back in. The play was the like
[10685.49s -> 10693.00s]  back off, but I wanted to see if I could like, I wanted to see if I was terrible or not.
[10693.00s -> 10700.20s]  You know, I was. But yeah, I mean the clumble with Kate is like if they're trapped,
[10700.20s -> 10707.20s]  you want to queue while they're in the trap, essentially because your auto will always give you the range.
[10707.20s -> 10714.20s]  So if you auto and then queue, when they're trapped they get, not a lot of people know this,
[10714.20s -> 10720.20s]  because I just found this out like a few years, or like after I should have.
[10720.20s -> 10725.20s]  When you queue on top of a K-trap, the WhiteKate's queue works is when you queue,
[10725.20s -> 10729.20s]  the initial like it hits initially, and then it does less damage to the targets behind it, right?
[10729.20s -> 10732.68s]  But it's very narrow and then it gets bigger.
[10732.68s -> 10735.80s]  So when they're trapped though,
[10735.80s -> 10738.08s]  it does the maximum queue damage that it can do
[10738.08s -> 10739.92s]  in like the isolation of the queue.
[10739.92s -> 10741.80s]  So that's why when people are trapped,
[10741.80s -> 10745.47s]  you wanna open up with your queue.
[10745.47s -> 10749.51s]  You either wanna net into the queue and then double auto,
[10749.51s -> 10753.03s]  or you wanna net, or you wanna queue,
[10753.03s -> 10756.35s]  then trap net at the same time, then double auto.
[10756.35s -> 10759.19s]  You basically, it's a very interesting way to play.
[10759.19s -> 10762.07s]  You always want to try and overlay a trap on your trap.
[10762.07s -> 10765.19s]  So when they get trapped, you can overlay a second trap
[10765.19s -> 10767.83s]  to either in front of them or behind them.
[10767.83s -> 10770.47s]  And what'll happen is there's actually like a little mini,
[10770.47s -> 10773.51s]  like I want to say one second cooldown of being able to be
[10773.51s -> 10774.11s]  trapped, right?
[10774.11s -> 10776.35s]  Like a little 1.5, 2 second cooldown.
[10776.35s -> 10778.19s]  But what can happen is they sit in the trap.
[10778.19s -> 10780.27s]  Then what you can do is your net can slow them.
[10780.27s -> 10783.07s]  So you can actually queue in the first trap.
[10783.07s -> 10785.79s]  Then you can drop a second trap, net slow them
[10785.79s -> 10788.23s]  into the second trap, and then triple auto headshot them
[10788.23s -> 10791.03s]  from all three of the net, the two traps.
[10791.03s -> 10803.43s]  It's really complicated sounding, but this man
[10803.43s -> 10806.55s]  has redeemed end to my stream whenever you want.
[10813.54s -> 10817.23s]  What?
[10817.23s -> 10822.13s]  Why?
[10822.13s -> 10829.69s]  Why would you want to end my stream, right, though?
[10829.69s -> 10838.31s]  Why would you want to be that guy?
[10838.31s -> 10850.32s]  Wow, okay.
[10850.32s -> 10853.20s]  Don't end, just change the camera position.
[10854.64s -> 10859.67s]  Did you just spend one million points
[10859.67s -> 10868.92s]  to tell me to put the camera back on the right side of my bucket.
[10869.12s -> 10870.68s]  No way.
[10872.08s -> 10878.12s]  No way, you just did that.
[10878.12s -> 10881.24s]  I was like, this man is just flexing.
[10881.24s -> 10883.88s]  He's just like, yeah, I got some points to spare.
[10883.88s -> 10885.56s]  I guess I could like throw them, you know,
[10885.56s -> 10901.97s]  eh, alright, fine.
[10901.97s -> 10902.81s]  There's that better.
[10903.77s -> 10910.32s]  Is that better?
[10910.32s -> 10911.20s]  Drink water.
[10911.20s -> 10912.24s]  Actually, that's a good one.
[10912.24s -> 10913.08s]  I'll be right back.
[10913.08s -> 10916.29s]  I'm gonna get some water.
[10916.29s -> 10918.13s]  Should we plan our main?
[10918.13s -> 10920.31s]  I kind of want to try and hit GM.
[10920.31s -> 10921.31s]  Yeah, let's get on our main account.
[10921.31s -> 10924.19s]  It's like one PM, so it's like three PM Eastern.
[10924.19s -> 10930.33s]  I think I can get cues at the moment.
[10930.33s -> 10933.17s]  I'll make it some water and then we'll cue up,
[10933.17s -> 10943.22s]  or we'll cue up then gets water, okay?
[10943.22s -> 10944.22s]  Cause I think it's late enough
[10944.22s -> 10953.02s]  in the day I can get cues now without waiting 40 minutes.
[10953.02s -> 10955.74s]  By the way, it is a teaching stream
[10955.74s -> 10957.46s]  when I'm doing that like a Katy Perry Academy thing.
[10957.46s -> 10958.98s]  So if you go to have any questions you want to ask
[10958.98s -> 10961.10s]  or like you guys gonna ignore that.
[10961.10s -> 10962.36s]  If you guys have any questions you want to ask
[10962.36s -> 10964.36s]  or anything like that's, you know,
[10964.36s -> 10965.64s]  if we're just chillin' between games,
[10965.64s -> 10966.64s]  just ask whatever you want.
[10966.64s -> 10969.60s]  I can answer a lot easier between games
[10969.60s -> 10971.92s]  that I can't in-game, you know,
[10971.92s -> 10973.32s]  it's a lot easier for me to see that shit.
[10973.32s -> 10974.32s]  I try an answer in-game,
[10974.32s -> 10976.52s]  but sometimes I'm like focusing in-shit.
[10976.52s -> 10985.07s]  So it's a little harder.
[10985.07s -> 10988.31s]  I'm getting some water though, so I'll be right back, okay?
[10989.51s -> 10990.75s]  Talk amongst yourselves.
[10991.79s -> 10993.71s]  Is Crackin' troll on Kate?
[10993.71s -> 10996.07s]  No, Crackin' is good on Kate.
[10996.07s -> 10997.87s]  You can go crackin' into Bud ther store
[10997.87s -> 11002.19s]  are cracking in the IE if you really need it, if they have like tanks. So they have
[11002.19s -> 11007.23s]  like, sign on to 20 stuff like that. You have to like, you're the only damage. You'll
[11007.23s -> 11011.23s]  say you're like the only tank killer on the team. You're the only 80 damage. You have to go
[11011.23s -> 11012.11s]  crack instant.
[12155.79s -> 12187.36s]  Shhhhmphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphph
[12187.36s -> 12191.44s]  of like be able to help yourself early game with all the fighting going on is going to have
[12191.44s -> 12198.08s]  a lot more value than Ghost. Ghost is more of like a, oh we hit mid game or a giant fight
[12198.08s -> 12203.04s]  broke out and I can like it's an extended long fight and I can get Ghost utilization. Also
[12203.04s -> 12208.08s]  Ghost is really valuable when you have good mechanical skill. Ghost requires very good positioning
[12208.08s -> 12212.48s]  typically because you're repositioning a lot in the fight and that's why Ghost is so good
[12212.48s -> 12214.92s]  because you can reposition back forward, back forward, back forward,
[12214.92s -> 12223.29s]  and you can essentially space the enemy and get free damage.
[12223.29s -> 12224.33s]  Free boots do.
[12224.33s -> 12226.73s]  It depends on the champion and the matchup.
[12226.73s -> 12231.13s]  Like, if I'm playing jinx, and I'm playing into, like,
[12231.13s -> 12232.25s]  I don't know.
[12232.25s -> 12234.81s]  Let's say I'm playing into, like, high sub Lulu, okay?
[12234.81s -> 12236.17s]  You can take free boots.
[12236.17s -> 12238.01s]  You don't need early boots in that matchup,
[12238.01s -> 12239.69s]  because it's an a chance or a farm,
[12239.69s -> 12242.81s]  80 carry versus an a chance or a farm, 80 carry, okay?
[12242.81s -> 12245.37s]  Now, if I'm versus, let's say I'm versus like a blitz crank.
[12245.37s -> 12247.77s]  Let's say I'm playing jinx and I'm versus blitz.
[12247.77s -> 12249.61s]  Like I typically don't want to have to wait
[12249.61s -> 12252.89s]  on nine minutes to get boots because blitz cranks can shit on me.
[12252.89s -> 12257.45s]  So I will take different runes versus that blitz crank to allow myself.
[12258.57s -> 12261.45s]  The option of like, let's say I have 1100 gold and I back,
[12261.45s -> 12266.41s]  I can get early boots and now the blitz crank has a much harder time.
[12266.41s -> 12274.17s]  Do you know, I almost want to ban Z, because I don't want to get shit on by stylish,
[12274.17s -> 12275.05s]  but I think it's cringe.
[12275.05s -> 12278.05s]  I don't want to like ban style shots.
[12278.05s -> 12296.34s]  I loved it as ADK by Bob.
[12296.34s -> 12297.34s]  Do you play parallel to your sport?
[12297.34s -> 12299.34s]  You try to always.
[12299.34s -> 12304.97s]  Essentially, the perfect way to play bot win is your both hitting one target.
[12304.97s -> 12307.97s]  At the same time, trading on one target at the same time,
[12307.97s -> 12309.97s]  you're making a little triangle.
[12309.97s -> 12311.97s]  You're both just like standing next to each other
[12311.97s -> 12315.41s]  and you're both hitting that one target, right?
[12315.41s -> 12317.41s]  That's the best way to play bot lane,
[12317.41s -> 12321.36s]  but it's very hard and so acute, obviously, to do that.
[12321.36s -> 12323.36s]  But if you're not going to do it, you can practice it.
[12323.36s -> 12325.36s]  Sorry, it went down there on pipe.
[12325.36s -> 12328.12s]  I, eight of here are two of us.
[12328.12s -> 12329.96s]  I shouldn't make one.
[12329.96s -> 12332.44s]  I have this thing where even though I'm like
[12332.44s -> 12336.64s]  a grandmaster level, I still think I suck.
[12337.64s -> 12339.16s]  I have this like really black of confidence
[12339.16s -> 12340.56s]  because I used to be challenger
[12340.56s -> 12342.44s]  and then like hard stuck GM.
[12342.44s -> 12343.72s]  So I have this lack of confidence
[12343.72s -> 12344.84s]  of what I'm talking about.
[12346.08s -> 12348.04s]  So I feel like if I were to make it to your list,
[12348.04s -> 12351.80s]  it would be based on like a GM player's skill.
[12351.80s -> 12354.28s]  And I don't know if like, I don't want to get ripped apart
[12354.28s -> 12356.92s]  by people.
[12356.92s -> 12376.28s]  But I guess I could make a tier list for my own opinion.
[12376.28s -> 12377.84s]  Like let me see, tier list maker.
[12378.92s -> 12412.84s]  I'm sure there's a tier list maker with champions, right?
[12412.84s -> 12413.48s]  Yeah, there it is.
[12414.56s -> 12415.48s]  Wait, this is terrible.
[12415.48s -> 12423.19s]  What are these pictures?
[12423.19s -> 12424.95s]  I'm just, what is this?
[12424.95s -> 12426.11s]  What is this?
[12427.23s -> 12439.80s]  Why is Nico on here?
[12439.80s -> 12446.40s]  I wanna use this one, but this one doesn't have Xary.
[12446.40s -> 12447.96s]  I'm trying to find one with Xary on it.
[12447.96s -> 12449.12s]  It doesn't look like shit.
[12449.12s -> 12452.12s]  It says this one has Xary, but it looks like,
[12452.12s -> 12465.36s]  It looks shitty. I don't enjoy that.
[12465.36s -> 12468.36s]  Hold on. We're going to play Ash this game because they picked his Earth.
[12468.36s -> 12472.36s]  Like I just saw them first pick Xareth, so I want something that can engage on this Earth.
[12472.36s -> 12477.36s]  So we're going to go Ash. These are going to be my Ash runes this game boys.
[12477.36s -> 12492.41s]  So I want to go present to mines. I don't know. I kind of do, but I kind of don't.
[12492.41s -> 12496.41s]  I think present to mine kind of sucks. It feels kind of shitty.
[12496.41s -> 12502.35s]  Hmm, we can just do it over here.
[12503.23s -> 12507.12s]  We can go lacquerty.
[12507.12s -> 12510.24s]  I probably won't go crack inside of this game, so we could probably just go lacquerty.
[12511.92s -> 12515.20s]  Even though crack inside is not bad on Ash. I kind of want to go borne crush.
[12522.00s -> 12530.56s]  But I could go, I actually don't know what I want to take if I want to take borderline of our lacquerty.
[12530.56s -> 12531.76s]  I'm going to take lacquerty. We'll try it out.
[12533.20s -> 12534.24s]  And then we'll do guffs.
[12534.24s -> 12534.96s]  Okay.
[12534.96s -> 12536.80s]  Um, what's that going to say?
[12538.64s -> 12539.68s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12539.68s -> 12541.28s]  I need to find the right tier list.
[12541.28s -> 12547.67s]  I mean, I can just use this, right?
[12547.67s -> 12549.37s]  I can't.
[12549.37s -> 12557.43s]  Where's Zary?
[12557.43s -> 12558.93s]  Oh.
[12558.93s -> 12560.93s]  Oh, there we go.
[12560.93s -> 12562.77s]  Yeah, this is good, okay.
[12562.77s -> 12563.93s]  I was like, I was trying to figure it out.
[12563.93s -> 12567.12s]  I was like, what the fuck?
[12567.12s -> 12569.00s]  I think just straight out of the gate,
[12569.00s -> 12571.68s]  I was putting Jinks in Esther.
[12571.68s -> 12573.80s]  I think Jinks is just an Esther champion.
[12573.80s -> 12575.56s]  She's crazy, OP.
[12575.56s -> 12579.20s]  Like, Jinks just does whatever champion wants to do,
[12579.20s -> 12580.68s]  but like better than them.
[12580.68s -> 12582.28s]  She's blind-peckable.
[12582.28s -> 12585.36s]  Her two item three item spike is crazy.
[12585.36s -> 12588.32s]  She doesn't have a lot of really bad match ups
[12588.32s -> 12590.20s]  and the way in phase anymore.
[12590.20s -> 12592.32s]  They gave her scaling crazy high.
[12592.32s -> 12593.40s]  Like, she's just good.
[12594.72s -> 12595.92s]  Good build past, et cetera.
[12595.92s -> 12597.48s]  Like, she's just a good champion.
[12600.55s -> 12602.75s]  I would say it's also hard to do tier list
[12602.75s -> 12603.59s]  because you have to be tier list
[12603.59s -> 12606.23s]  for like low elo and high elo, right?
[12606.23s -> 12609.19s]  Cause if I'm doing like a low elo tier list,
[12609.19s -> 12612.27s]  you're putting a math like here, right?
[12612.27s -> 12613.95s]  Like, MF super good.
[12613.95s -> 12614.87s]  if you're doing a high yellow tier,
[12614.87s -> 12616.03s]  I said, I have to like here.
[12617.59s -> 12620.19s]  It's hard to explain.
[12620.19s -> 12621.29s]  And like in what we love, I'm putting
[12621.29s -> 12622.91s]  a list of here.
[12622.91s -> 12624.43s]  But in high yellow, I'm putting her here.
[12625.87s -> 12631.87s]  So it's really interesting, right?
[12631.87s -> 12633.15s]  Because it's all based on like people's
[12633.15s -> 12635.23s]  mechanical skill too.
[12635.23s -> 12638.47s]  But yeah, we do the tier of us between games, I guess.
[12638.47s -> 12642.03s]  So far, I think Jinx is definitely aster.
[12642.03s -> 12645.64s]  I wish there was like an aster,
[12645.64s -> 12647.88s]  but Jinx is definitely aster.
[12647.88s -> 12649.88s]  Draven's hard to choose for me.
[12649.88s -> 12651.84s]  Like I want to put him in a tier
[12651.84s -> 12653.08s]  cause he has a lot of counter matchups
[12653.08s -> 12658.86s]  but in solo queue, Draven feels insane.
[12658.86s -> 12662.34s]  So it's hard cause I don't think Draven's overrated
[12662.34s -> 12666.10s]  personally cause I don't have to beat Draven players.
[12666.10s -> 12668.34s]  But I also think in high elo
[12669.46s -> 12671.78s]  when people also know how to deal with Draven players,
[12671.78s -> 12676.93s]  the game I also do feel like
[12678.73s -> 12681.09s]  good Draven players and good people who know how to play
[12681.09s -> 12684.73s]  on Draven players, make Draven OP, but it's also the opposite.
[12684.73s -> 12686.97s]  Worked good players, you know how to play around Draven,
[12686.97s -> 12688.57s]  can counterpick Draven and make him worthless.
[12688.57s -> 12706.09s]  So it's really, it's really hard.
[12706.09s -> 12711.09s]  All right, let me say, Morgana versus the Moomu.
[12717.02s -> 12717.94s]  He Moomu.
[12717.94s -> 12719.46s]  Jin players.
[12719.46s -> 12721.14s]  Jin players are psychopaths, man.
[12723.14s -> 12724.62s]  I don't think Jin's very good or not.
[12724.62s -> 12726.02s]  I think he could be good if they gave him
[12726.02s -> 12727.34s]  like a quality life change.
[12727.34s -> 12737.93s]  Is he getting buff next patch? I think he's getting buffed. I think he should do agents such a fun champ
[12737.93s -> 12749.56s]  He's just like a little shitty
[12749.56s -> 12756.39s]  We can actually just straight fight them right now. If I'm gonna move just queues because
[12756.39s -> 12763.99s]  Murana's worth a sub one
[12763.99s -> 12769.56s]  Like I actually just straight up want to fight these guys right now go go go go
[12780.65s -> 12782.65s]  I hope he messed both his queues
[12783.19s -> 12789.15s]  Dude this guy this is a move who's killing me man. Oh my god
[12789.15s -> 12791.15s]  I
[12791.15s -> 12797.32s]  Bro, what am I watching what is one of these curious brother? Oh
[12803.43s -> 12805.43s]  Shit
[12805.83s -> 12807.43s]  All right, I should have taken long-served
[12809.55s -> 12818.59s]  The movie is not feeling himself today. Let me tell you what he is not feeling himself
[12834.49s -> 12836.97s]  Chase even if as comes chase
[12838.09s -> 12847.85s]  Okay, we run I don't know if we can fight this we can try
[12847.85s -> 12874.12s]  I'll follow. I mean that guy should die dude what I don't even know what's happening right now
[12874.12s -> 12876.12s]  This is this is crazy
[12876.92s -> 12884.41s]  This is ridiculous both mid laners just got like three kills out of nowhere
[12884.99s -> 12899.08s]  We went from like a ridiculously we went from like a grandmaster game to like a diamond game
[12899.80s -> 12904.07s]  Like somehow
[12904.07s -> 12906.43s]  Like the Amumu's like kind of whipping some shit
[12906.43s -> 12912.43s]  I took a bad tread early, then fucking, this shit is funny as fuck.
[12912.43s -> 12925.15s]  So I'm gonna, I'm gonna actually rush tier two boots this game, because I actually really, really, really want to be mobile against their team.
[12925.15s -> 12931.15s]  I'm just gonna straight up leave, go buy T2 boots, and that's gonna be my power spike for Ash right now.
[12931.15s -> 12937.79s]  right now. They have so many things that I can dodge on their team like look at the shit right like
[12937.79s -> 12942.91s]  more binding T2 boots super easy to dodge if she can't flash it on me right like she can't flash
[12942.91s -> 12947.07s]  melee range but more bind it's I should never get hit by unless I have no fingers.
[12947.87s -> 12953.47s]  Ezreal Q easy to dodge, Zareth easy to dodge this guy whatever the fuck,
[12954.11s -> 12958.03s]  Kazik bugman is a melee champ so boots have value etc.
[12958.03s -> 12972.23s]  Also, the cool thing about Boots Rush Ash is she doesn't have damage that if I'm good at spacing like the better at spacing you are
[12973.55s -> 12975.55s]  You can actually just one B2
[12976.51s -> 12978.51s]  Especially against double skill shots like this
[12979.79s -> 13007.71s]  It's pretty fun. Fuck if I juked that last QO to kill that guy
[13008.35s -> 13010.83s]  Dude, Zareth actually fucked us so bad though
[13011.27s -> 13014.27s]  That was a good fight until Zareth just showed up and beat our ass
[13014.27s -> 13033.68s]  Yeah, just get the just get them anyway, it's kind of funny to watch though because I do so little damage
[13034.16s -> 13038.56s]  But I also like just parma slow, so they can't do anything about it
[13041.55s -> 13045.71s]  Hopefully when TF gets six he can come bot and we can fuck over their bollin
[13047.23s -> 13049.23s]  I'm hoping that that's the case
[13055.66s -> 13064.14s]  We're on a room to mid, Kazakhstan's also mid, TF dead. That's a good room
[13064.70s -> 13072.41s]  I'm gonna push this so that maybe we can play for dragon
[13072.41s -> 13079.30s]  Because they might go for a dragon here and I think we can stop it. We have tiffles.
[13079.30s -> 13089.40s]  Yep. Nice. We just leave.
[13089.40s -> 13094.40s]  We don't need to actually chase or turn in crazy. We're just stopping the dragon. That's all we're doing.
[13094.40s -> 13104.43s]  Right? We don't want to give him a free drink. See, the T2 boots are just broken. They're broken as shit.
[13104.43s -> 13113.73s]  Because you can just see like I can pretty much just...
[13113.73s -> 13121.26s]  I'm just too fast for them to deal with. Like, look at this. It's insane.
[13121.26s -> 13136.75s]  And that's why I value like the Tier 2 boots on champions, especially like Ash where you can be extra
[13136.75s -> 13142.11s]  egregious with it, because like her slow, imagine he's like, you know, it's the same idea as
[13142.11s -> 13143.11s]  vain, right?
[13143.11s -> 13147.47s]  When you think about it, it's like, okay, so what's really annoying trying to run away from
[13147.47s -> 13148.55s]  a vein, right?
[13148.55s -> 13152.47s]  She gets boots too and you're like, god damn it, man, she's so fast.
[13152.47s -> 13155.35s]  Same thing with Ash, oh, we now you're slow.
[13155.35s -> 13156.35s]  So it's even more annoying.
[13156.35s -> 13159.47s]  You try and go in on her, she just spaces you walks away a bit.
[13159.47s -> 13163.55s]  Now you're just sitting there, watering towards her solo way, just upset, tilted, frustrated.
[13164.83s -> 13166.59s]  You know, that's like your middle school dance.
[13185.07s -> 13186.03s]  You know what?
[13189.56s -> 13191.24s]  I think it's actually a shield bogeam.
[13192.84s -> 13193.56s]  It is.
[13194.20s -> 13196.68s]  I was gonna go Bork, but I think this is a shield bogeam.
[13198.44s -> 13201.24s]  It could be a Gale Force game too, both are both are viable.
[13202.68s -> 13207.08s]  But uh, I actually, I might be one of the, I might be in the minority here with this.
[13207.08s -> 13210.76s]  I think Bork Rush on Ash is actually good sometimes
[13212.00s -> 13218.28s]  Like I think if I was versus some tanks like you know like a sign on or something like that's I actually think Bork Rush on Ash is kind of cracked
[13219.52s -> 13223.96s]  Like yeah, it stalls out like you make the argument like it stalls out your three item or you're too item
[13224.36s -> 13226.36s]  But it feels kind of nuts
[13227.88s -> 13231.40s]  Also, this is a really OP thing that you can do I should have hawkshot it sooner
[13231.40s -> 13233.24s]  I knew that they were doing
[13233.24s -> 13237.64s]  Rift but I'm not paying attention as much as I should be so
[13243.61s -> 13249.33s]  Because what you can do is you can hock shot to tell your team where the enemy junglers and get information yourself
[13253.50s -> 13259.85s]  I mean this Morgana's a little five we could fight just because Morgan's five right now
[13261.89s -> 13263.89s]  I kind of want to try
[13269.32s -> 13278.85s]  My move didn't want to go in my bed. I'm a little sad. I'm not gonna lie because I do feel
[13279.15s -> 13291.15s]  Like we win these fights, but I'm gonna move on to the wait for six, which is fine, but like I said, you guys know me, I'd like to actually fight and be active in the lane, or maybe because I know that we can fight, right?
[13292.15s -> 13305.31s]  And so it's like obviously, you know, oh, this is really rough.
[13306.31s -> 13307.31s]  I can't do anything.
[13309.88s -> 13310.88s]  Because there it's here.
[13310.88s -> 13316.88s]  TF's coming with ult though. I don't have ult damn it if I don't this would be so
[13316.88s -> 13322.51s]  god tier. God you have no idea how OP this would be if I had ulti man.
[13322.51s -> 13329.52s]  Whenever I'm bad. I want to push this way though. I'm assuming they're all backing.
[13329.52s -> 13336.52s]  I think we've penned out there with ult we even killed the top laner. Oh I'm bad. Why did I stay?
[13336.52s -> 13342.52s]  I knew Cosics would do that. I have to retrain my brain. Cosics players are rats.
[13342.52s -> 13346.86s]  Rats and I have to retrain my brand uh, remember that they will sit in a bush for 30 minutes
[13346.86s -> 13349.20s]  Lose all of their farm to get one kill
[13349.92s -> 13351.92s]  I like always forget that
[13351.92s -> 13357.54s]  Like cause expires are absolute fucking rats
[13359.34s -> 13366.92s]  Like I respect to rank our players more than cause expires. Yeah, I said it. I know hot take right now
[13367.24s -> 13373.05s]  But I do I'm gonna try an arrow right here
[13377.02s -> 13381.84s]  God, I'm you know that guy's pissed by the way
[13381.84s -> 13394.38s]  that damn it. He's going to try and ult me from the bush. You can always tell that
[13394.38s -> 13399.18s]  you're about to get ulted when an Ezreal big big tip for you guys. If an Ezreal ever walks
[13399.18s -> 13405.50s]  out of vision, expect that he's ulting you. I you would not believe you would not believe
[13405.50s -> 13410.30s]  the amount of people that I kill with Ezreal by simply walking into a bush and ulting them
[13410.30s -> 13417.02s]  and they forget that I exist. I'm not even kidding it happens so often. They're just like,
[13417.02s -> 13419.26s]  Oh, yeah, he went in the bush. He's gonna hit his old key
[13420.06s -> 13425.90s]  Like it is comical how often happens and I'm sure you guys have died to it too
[13427.26s -> 13431.50s]  Because it's like a thing where like you never see it you barely you don't see Ezreal that often right?
[13431.66s -> 13434.60s]  So because you probably don't see Ezreal too often you're always like, oh
[13436.85s -> 13443.04s]  Interesting type shit
[13443.04s -> 13445.64s]  I'm gonna grab this play it and then I'm gonna back up
[13447.60s -> 13450.00s]  Cosics is coming down here so I'm gonna back the fuck up
[13450.00s -> 13460.12s]  up. So I don't have arrow for 20. Ezreal has tri-force. We need to back up a bit. We might
[13460.12s -> 13473.06s]  have to give dragon. I could see giving dragon being okay though. It's not that bad. Yeah,
[13473.06s -> 13477.22s]  it's not, it's not the worst to give drake here. I could even back so we don't get
[13477.22s -> 13486.62s]  dove. But if we back now, we might lose bot turret, but I can't walk up. Yeah, that's what
[13486.62s -> 13488.86s]  I didn't want to have happened.
[13488.86s -> 13495.39s]  See, that's, let's tell it you've had rats.
[13495.39s -> 13500.71s]  Absolute rats.
[13500.71s -> 13502.27s]  Cosics players are rats, man.
[13502.27s -> 13513.40s]  Absolute literal rats.
[13513.40s -> 13515.68s]  Oh, that's classy.
[13515.68s -> 13523.98s]  That's a good dodge.
[13523.98s -> 13527.82s]  I can't even walk up, but I can wait for the turret,
[13527.82s -> 13530.26s]  but I can't walk up.
[13530.26s -> 13532.38s]  I'll just die.
[13532.38s -> 13534.10s]  That's another thing you have to just accept.
[13534.10s -> 13535.62s]  I'm down 40 CS this game
[13535.62s -> 13538.86s]  because we've just been getting weeks out of it
[13538.86s -> 13539.98s]  and we've also been getting,
[13542.26s -> 13543.70s]  like a move is not very good.
[13545.34s -> 13546.98s]  I don't have a better way to say it.
[13546.98s -> 13548.34s]  I don't have like a nice way to say it.
[13548.34s -> 13550.30s]  He's not having a good game.
[13551.62s -> 13552.98s]  And when your support does not have a good game,
[13552.98s -> 13554.98s]  you don't have a good game early.
[13554.98s -> 13558.50s]  So the best thing you can do is just try and farm up
[13558.50s -> 13561.70s]  what you can, don't die, and scale from it.
[13564.21s -> 13565.89s]  It's all you can really do.
[13565.89s -> 13570.13s]  It doesn't need to carry when you're support sucks, it feels really bad, but
[13571.73s -> 13573.73s]  Sometimes you just gotta accept it, right?
[13573.73s -> 13584.83s]  This says rules, not bad, but he's not good either. Oh
[13585.71s -> 13606.13s]  This guy's gonna try to help me. I'm an old kill rancher. Nice. I don't have old up yet, guys
[13607.25s -> 13609.57s]  I don't have old up yet. I can't told you I
[13610.61s -> 13613.25s]  Have old now, but we need to bait them in a bit. I
[13615.72s -> 13617.88s]  Don't even want to use my old right now to be honest with you
[13617.88s -> 13619.88s]  I
[13619.88s -> 13621.88s]  really don't
[13621.88s -> 13625.88s]  You know what's funny that's there's actually pretty good I've played against them a few times in the past few seasons
[13625.88s -> 13629.88s]  He's actually not bad. He used to be a support main
[13629.88s -> 13643.43s]  He played Zara support. That's why I recognize his name.
[13643.43s -> 13649.43s]  We should not go for this refs. I'm on a bad timer for this
[13649.43s -> 13659.35s]  because I'm really a well HP and mana.
[13659.35s -> 13662.35s]  Ooh, I don't have mana to arrow here, guys.
[13662.35s -> 13676.12s]  I do not want to arrow that because the fewer I can totally, the fewer I can do whatever it's called.
[13676.12s -> 13687.76s]  The fewer I can, whatever it's called, the W it if she's fast enough, and I didn't want to get my team killed.
[13687.76s -> 13693.76s]  The real issue here is that we're forcing, okay, I'll tell you exactly what the real issue is.
[13693.76s -> 13702.08s]  We're forcing too many fights for no reason right now, so we're all forcing tons of fights at the moment, but there's no reason for us to force these fights.
[13702.08s -> 13716.08s]  That's that's why my team's getting tilted, right? Like for some reason, the Amumu and the TF are both just like inting and they're both getting frustrated, but we actually win the game if we play it slow.
[13716.08s -> 13727.06s]  I mean, we can we can swap out his game out in scale, but it just takes time.
[13727.06s -> 13731.06s]  Because I specifically picked Ash so that we can we had an answer for Sarah.
[13731.06s -> 13735.06s]  Because we have TF and Ash, right? So we have we have a really good answer for him.
[13735.06s -> 13742.06s]  The problem is, we need to like stop tilting and just like understand that we can deal with him later.
[13742.06s -> 13748.06s]  He's not like a he's not like an asle, right? Like asle is one of those champs that like, you can't deal with.
[13748.06s -> 13753.86s]  Why did my Mumu wait to use Ulti?
[13753.86s -> 13755.86s]  What?
[13755.86s -> 13758.86s]  He was in range.
[13758.86s -> 13761.86s]  I know he was.
[13761.86s -> 13770.10s]  Oh, nice.
[13770.10s -> 13771.50s]  Okay, we got a kill.
[13771.50s -> 13775.10s]  We need TF to play the game too though.
[13775.10s -> 13778.10s]  Our TF is really tilted, so he's just sitting bot.
[13778.10s -> 13785.36s]  A Mumu is extra tilted too, but I mean, I'll be honest, the Mumu is playing
[13785.36s -> 13786.36s]  worse than TF.
[13786.36s -> 13787.36s]  It's just that he's...
[13787.36s -> 13792.68s]  Dude, I hate when stuff happens like this. Stop, stop pinging the guy man. He's already frustrated.
[13792.68s -> 13796.80s]  You pinging him is not gonna make him less frustrated. You're just gonna piss him off more.
[13798.52s -> 13804.66s]  Well, I just play it dude. We have a really good team comp.
[13805.86s -> 13819.78s]  Like we're behind right now, but we have a good team comp. We should give this dragon by the way. They get 1000%. We don't have T-Apples.
[13820.90s -> 13824.90s]  Like maybe maybe we could fight this, but the morgue's here, so she can spell from my arrow.
[13824.90s -> 13832.18s]  They got rifts like we should give the drink. We also have no vision control of this area
[13833.46s -> 13838.10s]  So this is another thing of like why you guys wonder like why I play support in the C-Low?
[13838.66s -> 13846.40s]  Like I get asked about why are you a support man now? I'm not an 80 man, but the thing is it's really hard to play the game when your supports
[13846.94s -> 13848.94s]  Don't ward correctly
[13849.94s -> 13854.10s]  We can give this guys. We can give it's not a huge deal. No, it's top. We do not have to fight this
[13855.02s -> 13856.52s]  Guys, we don't have to fight this
[13856.66s -> 13869.04s]  It's back up. Yeah, like this isn't a fight. It's only second dragon. It's nothing. Wow, I suck at CSN.
[13869.04s -> 13884.44s]  But you see how little vision control we have on the map right now. We have one ward here, and that's about it.
[13884.44s -> 13891.44s]  Vision control is, I say it's 90% of the game and solo queue. That's why I feel like supports are like the unsung hero.
[13891.44s -> 13896.44s]  Like when you get a support, you notice how to properly throw out vision control. It feels insane.
[13896.44s -> 13908.06s]  We just got a push. I do have Hawkshot in in a second. We can see if they're on this
[13909.46s -> 13911.46s]  Okay, they're not
[13912.02s -> 13914.02s]  I can ball me we can back up
[13916.29s -> 13925.07s]  Cosics is above me right now. Okay, Cosics wasted results. That's not bad
[13926.83s -> 13928.35s]  We should back I
[13928.51s -> 13931.63s]  Don't want to take this fight. Tf could ulti, but he's not
[13932.51s -> 13938.43s]  Right like this this is one of those moments where like I actually think we actually could have killed two of them right there
[13938.83s -> 13940.83s]  If they have golden
[13940.95s -> 13951.58s]  Because they were out of position really hard, but again, it's not like I think they're gonna walk. I think cosmic's
[13953.06s -> 13959.98s]  Yeah, he's somewhere up here. I don't know where he is and I can't I can't I can't hawkshot. I wasted my hawkshot for this dragon or this barren
[13960.58s -> 13964.08s]  They could be on barren
[13964.40s -> 13970.60s]  We need to check but I have no hawkshots. Okay, they're not they're not we're chillin good. Can you any 100 golds?
[13970.60s -> 14003.75s]  Yeah, I'm aware I'm getting ganked. I'm fully fucking aware trust me. I'm just trying to force them to make a choice
[14004.63s -> 14019.36s]  Probably wasn't a great use of my ghost, but I say we bail. I need to go get my item
[14021.80s -> 14024.92s]  As real is just pushing aside somehow. I'm contested over there
[14025.32s -> 14042.29s]  Somebody is TP bot. What what the fuck is this a moomu doing what is my team doing? What are you guys doing?
[14043.01s -> 14054.60s]  This is so awkward man. I mean guys
[14054.60s -> 14064.60s]  Guys, kill the Cosics. Oh, thank God. I don't know why Cosics just dove to kill me of all people
[14065.60s -> 14069.60s]  My man just like wanted me dead. He was like, yeah fuck that 80 carry guy
[14070.60s -> 14072.60s]  Like okay
[14073.10s -> 14075.10s]  Sure
[14075.60s -> 14079.16s]  Fuck me, what do I want?
[14081.17s -> 14084.17s]  If I can eat damage, but I don't know what gives me the highest damage here
[14085.17s -> 14092.06s]  Maybe just
[14092.56s -> 14094.56s]  Maybe just PD.
[14094.56s -> 14098.26s]  Not, I'm not actually sure.
[14098.26s -> 14100.26s]  I would be good, but it doesn't give me like more...
[14100.26s -> 14102.26s]  It gives you like...
[14102.26s -> 14104.26s]  I use interesting in this position.
[14104.26s -> 14108.26s]  Like, I almost want more movement speed from the like PD.
[14108.26s -> 14111.26s]  Even though normally, like the utility is better.
[14111.26s -> 14119.92s]  Like, maybe PT is still the best, and I'm just trolling.
[14119.92s -> 14121.92s]  We can just do dragon right now.
[14121.92s -> 14123.92s]  They have no TP here, Barron.
[14123.92s -> 14125.92s]  I think we totally actually could do this.
[14125.92s -> 14127.92s]  I'm down to try if you want to.
[14127.92s -> 14134.26s]  try if you if you want to ring her they got two people bought they're setting up for dragon vision right now
[14134.98s -> 14137.78s]  I'm actually kind of down to just try and play for Baron here
[14144.93s -> 14149.09s]  Like we could bait Baron here and force them to walk into us with my arrow
[14177.40s -> 14179.80s]  I want to stay together because I don't know where the cause exists
[14182.61s -> 14198.90s]  Found him what is my mimo doing dude he has smite like I pull it out if you're gonna do this right like
[14198.90s -> 14200.90s]  Like, I use your brain, man.
[14200.90s -> 14219.48s]  All right, now we do burn though, we have to do.
[14219.48s -> 14220.48s]  We have to do burn.
[14220.48s -> 14226.78s]  This is like one of the worst players that ever seen this in the movie.
[14226.78s -> 14228.78s]  He has no clue what he's doing, by the way.
[14228.78s -> 14235.97s]  Like, he's so dumb.
[14235.97s -> 14237.97s]  He's like flaming the TF.
[14237.97s -> 14242.97s]  In his mind, he's so angry at this TF that he's ignoring every single thing that's going on.
[14242.97s -> 14246.97s]  Like, he's ignoring that like the dragon was a bad call to begin with.
[14246.97s -> 14248.97s]  And if we are going to do that dragon,
[14248.97s -> 14252.15s]  We have to zone the fucking jungle orb because he has fucking it
[14253.17s -> 14255.17s]  Smite right so it's like
[14256.41s -> 14258.41s]  What are you talking about that?
[14258.41s -> 14260.41s]  These players are crazy
[14260.65s -> 14264.33s]  It just feels to me like they're so angry at everything. It's kind of funny
[14266.36s -> 14271.00s]  Okay, I got three items now. I went for the PD because I kind of think the extra movement speed in the extra
[14272.04s -> 14277.81s]  It'll help a lot. I will say both the junglers are playing really well
[14278.53s -> 14280.53s]  This game is like
[14280.53s -> 14281.89s]  Interesting
[14281.89s -> 14286.29s]  I do not see like both the assassins are playing pretty well. The enemy's there is playing pretty decent
[14293.22s -> 14299.66s]  What that is not a I mean that was embarrassing like I don't even have words for that
[14301.50s -> 14306.94s]  Like I genuinely don't have words for that shit. I'm missed. I
[14311.72s -> 14314.12s]  Can't see we have no vision man
[14320.69s -> 14322.69s]  Like we have no vision
[14323.25s -> 14326.21s]  Nothing's awarded because the moon didn't put any wards down
[14328.53s -> 14334.21s]  So I can't fight because literally we're standing there in this area and there's nothing
[14334.21s -> 14343.46s]  awarded. The best part is all a mumu had to do was not die before that fight and we auto
[14343.46s -> 14349.22s]  win. But we were winning so hard. But this a mumu is actually solo losing us the game with
[14349.22s -> 14360.93s]  this fucking ego. God support players are so bad at league. Actually, and they'll deflect. Support
[14360.93s -> 14366.05s]  Where's well, well, why do themselves about how good they are and tell them that it's always their teams fall
[14366.05s -> 14373.19s]  But they'll drop nine deaths have nine KP in a fucking 23 kill game and then blame their fucking team
[14374.73s -> 14376.73s]  It's crazy
[14384.44s -> 14397.08s]  Please ward things man. Oh my god. He's dead again
[14404.11s -> 14408.23s]  Guys, why are we up here top? Why are we top guys?
[14414.97s -> 14416.97s]  Why are we three manning top right now?
[14418.45s -> 14419.73s]  Holy crap.
[14421.25s -> 14423.25s]  My teammates are absolute apes.
[14424.13s -> 14425.57s]  Like, what am I watching, man?
[14428.16s -> 14430.00s]  They just three man's top.
[14432.66s -> 14434.02s]  Oh my god.
[14438.16s -> 14440.32s]  Like, these are the worst players that I've ever fucking seen.
[14441.76s -> 14444.00s]  Like, we had the game in our hands.
[14444.40s -> 14446.80s]  And then all of a sudden, my team's like, you know what?
[14446.96s -> 14450.24s]  I don't actually want to win. And I'm like, why? And they're like, well, you see.
[14450.24s -> 14458.00s]  I have an ego and you're like oh I see this is why I can't play AD carry in the seal I'm sorry
[14458.00s -> 14462.80s]  I can't I have to play support in the seal because AD carry is actually not playable
[14464.96s -> 14469.20s]  When the entire game is decided by jungle support and mid
[14470.48s -> 14476.40s]  AD carry just does not decide any of the League of Legends games below Grandmaster not one of them like last game
[14477.04s -> 14479.68s]  We popped off and we won because we were the better AD carry right
[14480.24s -> 14486.92s]  This game it doesn't matter because TF does 11k damage doesn't ulti bot more than one time
[14487.40s -> 14489.40s]  Like Rengar did well
[14489.40s -> 14492.60s]  NAR did well, but they also had a horrible macro
[14494.86s -> 14501.52s]  Like it is insane to me how easy support is as a role and I just how dog shit every support player is on the server
[14502.24s -> 14504.94s]  Like your role requires zero thought
[14505.62s -> 14508.62s]  Your thought when playing support is
[14509.34s -> 14511.34s]  Do I get vision or not?
[14511.94s -> 14515.62s]  If no, where can I be the most useful?
[14515.62s -> 14522.85s]  Your thought should never be this game's over, my team sucks.
[14522.85s -> 14528.43s]  It drives me ludicrous.
[14528.43s -> 14531.19s]  Like I'm sorry that I have to play support on this account to climb,
[14531.19s -> 14533.71s]  but it's crazy how dog shit 80 carriers
[14533.71s -> 14535.75s]  when you're soul-wooking in masters.
[14535.75s -> 14538.59s]  Like in GM, well if it's a full GM game,
[14538.59s -> 14540.27s]  80 carries easiest fuck.
[14540.27s -> 14541.87s]  Like if everybody has a brain activity
[14541.87s -> 14544.59s]  and they're not idiots, 80 carriers amazing.
[14544.59s -> 14545.79s]  Favorite role in the game.
[14545.79s -> 14548.59s]  When you're playing with people who don't know what they're doing
[14548.59s -> 14550.79s]  and you're actively trying to climb and improve,
[14550.79s -> 14553.99s]  it genuinely feels like I'm pulling out a ball here
[14553.99s -> 14554.79s]  with my tweezers.
[14554.79s -> 14557.51s]  We're pulling out my ball hairs with tweezers.
[14557.51s -> 14564.51s]  Like one by one, it is so painful.
[14564.51s -> 14568.92s]  It's crazy.
[14568.92s -> 14571.44s]  Like let's take a look at this support man.
[14571.44s -> 14575.04s]  Right now, 97 LP, negative one rate, right?
[14576.36s -> 14580.84s]  I could literally tell that he was not a good player
[14580.84s -> 14587.57s]  in the first 30 seconds of that game.
[14587.57s -> 14588.89s]  I'm sorry I'm being mean, but dude,
[14588.89s -> 14594.54s]  this has been driving me crazy.
[14594.54s -> 14597.22s]  But look at the, look at the support I had last game.
[14597.22s -> 14601.46s]  Also, can I ask you question, why am I even allowed?
[14601.46s -> 14604.90s]  Why am I even allowed to be in games
[14604.90s -> 14607.98s]  with a Challenger support one game?
[14607.98s -> 14609.90s]  I win the game.
[14609.90s -> 14612.54s]  Then immediately it puts me in a game
[14612.54s -> 14620.72s]  with a 97 LP master support.
[14620.72s -> 14661.12s]  What is this matchmaking? This is insane. That's crazy. I don't even, I'm wondering why,
[14665.09s -> 14670.69s]  so I'm gonna go on a rant for a second. Why is this allowed? Why can you be in a game?
[14670.69s -> 14677.09s]  Why can I be in a game with a literal guy who's about to promote to Challenger? Right? We win the game.
[14677.81s -> 14681.81s]  And then the very next game, it puts me in a game where the guy who's 97 L.P.
[14681.81s -> 14703.45s]  this isn't sane. Sorry, that's just frustrating as fuck.
[14703.45s -> 14709.34s]  Because it's like such bad game design, right?
[14709.34s -> 14712.34s]  Like that's 900 LP difference.
[14712.34s -> 14722.68s]  And the thing is, this guy doesn't have good MMR, right?
[14722.68s -> 14726.68s]  Like it's not, it's not like this guy has good MMR, right?
[14726.68s -> 14728.68s]  Because we'll get his games.
[14728.68s -> 14731.68s]  He's playing with all master's players.
[14731.68s -> 14735.62s]  They're all like 100 LP masters 70 LP 30 LP, right?
[14736.76s -> 14743.64s]  It doesn't make sense. It's not like his MMR is high, so why is this guy getting into like a 600 LP
[14744.16s -> 14746.16s]  Grandmaster game?
[14746.16s -> 14748.16s]  Why are we putting that guy in the game?
[14748.36s -> 14758.84s]  That's so frustrating. Sorry. I just I need a event. How do you know which ADK to pick in each situation?
[14759.56s -> 14762.16s]  It's a lot of knowledge a lot of knowledge
[14764.16s -> 14766.16s]  Well you have to know
[14766.16s -> 14774.16s]  a lot of shit like what the enemy champions do, what your champions need to do to win the game, what the win cons are.
[14774.16s -> 14784.92s]  You can just pick, it would be honest though, you could just pick a, like there are 80 carries in the current meta where you can just pick that are blind.
[14784.92s -> 14786.92s]  Like I was making it to your list, I forgot about it.
[14786.92s -> 14789.92s]  But I mean, you can blind pick jinx pretty much every game.
[14789.92s -> 14794.92s]  Like jinx is just blindable every game pretty much, she's insane. She's super OP.
[14794.92s -> 14799.56s]  So if you ever just want to play a champion and you think like, okay, I want to practice
[14799.56s -> 14802.56s]  A-D, like, Jinx is insane. Super good.
[14805.51s -> 14810.87s]  Draven's not blindable, but I do think he's really good if you're good at the game. Draven's very good.
[14812.07s -> 14819.59s]  He's he's harder than Jinx by a mile like Draven's about harder, but he's definitely like good at carrying with a way you just well.
[14821.52s -> 14824.48s]  Like another blindable AD that I think it's like A-Tere is like Varus.
[14824.48s -> 14829.24s]  You can blind pick Varus really easily because Varus doesn't really have counters
[14830.24s -> 14835.66s]  Like he doesn't get countered by anything. He's more of like a you can pick him and then
[14836.14s -> 14840.34s]  Go even and your ulti will always be useful. You can look to like win lane
[14840.34s -> 14843.34s]  You can look to like engage things like that, right?
[14868.09s -> 14870.09s]  Okay, so this game
[14870.09s -> 14872.81s]  As the support I need to be tracking the jungler
[14872.81s -> 14883.19s]  So I'm going to think, where always be thinking what the enemy jungler wants to accomplish and how to stop it, that's like a pretty big tip of advice that I can give you guys
[14885.19s -> 14890.19s]  Like think to yourself like, okay, if I was the enemy jungler, what would I be wanting to do against this Graham, so right as Lisa.
[14891.19s -> 14895.19s]  He's probably going to want to either gank early, like inkbot early, or he wants to
[14897.19s -> 14903.19s]  Invade on certain timers, right? Because that's like what we just really good at is ganking and invading so
[14904.19s -> 14911.15s]  What I think I'm going to try to do this game is I'm going to try and watch for early
[14911.15s -> 14915.79s]  ganks and early pressure bot lane like level two level three ganks. We're still going to
[14915.79s -> 14920.91s]  be aggressive but Lux took TP which means this Lux does not plan on playing aggressive
[14920.91s -> 14927.39s]  at all like she basically if anybody takes TP like this in a lane I already know from start
[14927.39s -> 14931.31s]  of the game that they're not planning on doing anything so I'm probably going to end up roaming
[14931.31s -> 14949.74s]  a lot this game. This is gonna be a game where I roam a ton. We do have some good
[14949.74s -> 14965.16s]  lanes to roam too too. Like I'm roaming top and mid is both really good. I just
[14965.16s -> 14973.98s]  want her to ward early because I don't want to get shit on by way. So okay I'm just
[14973.98s -> 14979.14s]  gonna flash immediately. There's no reason to not flash there because Alister used this
[14979.14s -> 14983.74s]  flash to get my flash which is totally fine. It's better for him because he has
[14983.74s -> 14993.68s]  He's a hex flash, but it's not that bad because I can out-range him and I can stay away from his
[14994.44s -> 14999.16s]  His shit. So we know he's in the bush. We just chill
[15000.16s -> 15002.44s]  There it is. He fucked up now we go forward
[15003.88s -> 15008.16s]  I don't know why Lux isn't throwing spells at this guy. Like they I don't know why she didn't cue him
[15009.28s -> 15011.60s]  By he fucked up that the alas are shit of died there
[15013.12s -> 15018.96s]  And she's painting me. Okay, the alas are shit of died there if alas are ever fucked up on a gauge like that where he hex flashes in
[15019.24s -> 15022.96s]  gets stuck like Q is cooldown. Yeah, I don't know why I was thrown this way I'm saying
[15023.28s -> 15025.60s]  You don't throw you don't throw spells that
[15026.48s -> 15033.16s]  They aren't gonna land so there's no point in the box ever throwing her Q until Alistair fucks up the combo
[15033.88s -> 15038.60s]  Like she should have spoke with E and then um, because it's almost like a blitz hook, right?
[15038.60s -> 15043.00s]  Think of it like a blitz hook if she throws the Q out, right?
[15043.16s -> 15047.80s]  Now they have an opportunity to be aggressive because they know the ho- they know the ho- is down
[15047.80s -> 15055.56s]  so it's better for her to just hold the hook essentially right hold the cue and now when
[15055.56s -> 15060.92s]  avocer does go in they have to be nervous about that cue because they can't just think oh the
[15060.92s -> 15065.96s]  cue's down let's let's engage right so they can't actually think about that this is why I don't
[15065.96s -> 15079.45s]  like a lot of the time doing this like push first the way they can't engage on us without like
[15079.45s -> 15087.77s]  flashing, so it doesn't matter. Like, look, did she queue the wave again, or my an
[15087.77s -> 15095.83s]  idiots? Like, just, oh man, I'm losing my mind here. Oh, these, I'm, I'm tilting. It's
[15095.83s -> 15099.87s]  fun. I need to not tilt. I need to just chill, but I'm getting frustrated because we're
[15099.87s -> 15108.62s]  like, not using cooldowns properly, and it's driving me fucking crazy. Because these are
[15108.62s -> 15111.78s]  very simple things to do. You guys gotta walk the way of any, by the way, you can't
[15111.78s -> 15115.66s]  let them freeze. Okay. There are very simple things to do. I know I'm being annoying a shit
[15115.66s -> 15119.48s]  Winning about this but this is stuff that you you need to be thinking about when you're playing the game
[15119.78s -> 15121.78s]  Well you should actively be thinking
[15123.90s -> 15130.58s]  What can I do with my champions toolkit to stop their champions toolkit and you should be thinking okay?
[15130.58s -> 15134.82s]  I have cute right so what do they want to do they want to go in?
[15134.82s -> 15146.58s]  Okay, and when you're thinking they want to go in right you should be thinking okay when they go in I can just cue and that should be your entire thought process
[15146.58s -> 15154.58s]  You thought the process should never be, oh, maybe I can land a random Q at max range and we can get a kill.
[15154.58s -> 15163.66s]  She killed the wave, yes, that's why I mean, you should never Q the wave on Lux, either unless you're going to 100% reset.
[15163.66s -> 15172.16s]  That would be like if I hooked the wave as like, let's crank or some shit. Why is my Lux bait pinging my Graves?
[15172.16s -> 15176.16s]  Dude, I gotta keep this 100% honest with you, man.
[15176.16s -> 15181.16s]  You don't get, you don't get to be mad here.
[15181.16s -> 15184.16s]  Why are, these players are such babies.
[15184.16s -> 15189.94s]  Jesus Christ, what pussy's man?
[15189.94s -> 15194.09s]  These people are such babies.
[15194.09s -> 15197.09s]  The graves played correctly by the way, like 100%.
[15197.09s -> 15200.09s]  He's mad at the graves for taking away.
[15200.09s -> 15203.09s]  He wanted to not, like, he wanted to be able to TP back and get the wave.
[15203.09s -> 15208.09s]  That's what, this lock is so trash that she actually believes that's the grave's faults.
[15208.09s -> 15212.77s]  They're graves misplaced by pushing the bot wave. But it was the right play
[15214.25s -> 15220.61s]  Pushing the bot wave was the correct play there because then she would doesn't have to TP the whole reason that he's pushing it is to save her teleport
[15221.09s -> 15230.94s]  So that she doesn't have to TP to win players like this are why the game is hard to play right now in the current meta
[15231.32s -> 15236.60s]  Why it feels bad because this locks is trash everyone you guys can all see this locks is terrible
[15236.60s -> 15240.72s]  She's already made a bunch of mistakes. She's blaming her team. She's being a dip shit, right?
[15240.72s -> 15252.25s]  But she can climb up to this elo being this bad because of the system, the current system in place.
[15252.25s -> 15276.13s]  We should immediately do Baron here, Dragon, I mean, we should just come.
[15276.13s -> 15279.13s]  You don't have time for this, just come to Dragon.
[15279.13s -> 15288.15s]  Bro, the least is to show top, we should be doing Dragon.
[15288.15s -> 15302.74s]  When this should happen, by the way, where you have enemy jungler shows on one side of the map,
[15302.74s -> 15307.14s]  You should always be playing on the other side of the map to make a counter play
[15308.02s -> 15311.86s]  So jungler shows on top side we go for dragon, right?
[15312.46s -> 15321.02s]  Easy. Yo, be careful. Alister is going to be there. Zareth's going to be there. Just leave
[15321.74s -> 15327.23s]  Just leave leave leave. I'll do it for you. I'll make you leave. I got you man
[15329.66s -> 15333.18s]  But we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and
[15333.66s -> 15339.66s]  I need the backing out, but we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and not only do their bot lane have to back, but
[15340.38s -> 15342.38s]  I
[15342.38s -> 15350.34s]  tried man. I tried to flash Q him.
[15350.34s -> 15358.26s]  But yeah, it's really I don't know a lot of junglers don't I don't think they know what they're
[15358.26s -> 15362.26s]  I'm dead by the way. I'm not even going to pop exhaust. I'm just dead.
[15362.26s -> 15368.26s]  A lot of junglers don't know what the goal of the game actually is. A lot of them think it's
[15368.26s -> 15372.26s]  thousand bad insect but a lot of junglers think the goal of the game is to like get as much
[15372.26s -> 15376.34s]  the game is to get as much farm as you can and run over the enemy team and shit, but it's
[15376.34s -> 15381.46s]  actually it is, but it's also about like getting early objectives and turning those small
[15381.46s -> 15388.98s]  leads into big leads through objective control, right? So like right now, I want to rotate top.
[15388.98s -> 15393.30s]  Rift is up. I know Lee Sin's gonna be on top side of the map right now. I want to rotate top
[15393.86s -> 15398.34s]  so that I can help my team by being in the top side of the map because that's where the next
[15398.34s -> 15414.00s]  play is gonna be made. Well the play is made made, but I mean I'm here so it's fine. Oh my god,
[15418.42s -> 15431.26s]  I did not think the fucking least end would be there too. Oh, oops. This is rough. I don't really know how to
[15432.06s -> 15438.54s]  play this because I got there in time to counter the gank. All right. I exhausted the guy saved the
[15438.54s -> 15445.24s]  Zero I got there in time to counter the gang, but whoo well played
[15446.76s -> 15449.26s]  Does actually mega well played
[15450.88s -> 15456.23s]  That was really good. I want to push this way then, but I can't
[15465.10s -> 15470.78s]  Like you guys are noticing there's no objectives taken on the map yet at 10 minutes, which is kind of crazy
[15471.54s -> 15475.40s]  The alley's doing really good. The alley's just not a bad support player. He's playing well
[15475.40s -> 15497.60s]  Like he's playing very well a lot of this is more of like I need I don't have anything to do on the map because
[15498.60s -> 15501.60s]  I'm trying to help my jungler, but my jungler is trolling
[15502.60s -> 15504.60s]  It's really rough
[15504.60s -> 15508.60s]  Because like I'm trying to rotate over and help my jungler on cooldown basically, right?
[15508.60s -> 15521.71s]  But my jungler doesn't want to fight you see like I'm countering the alisters fight or ganks. It's just I'm just dead
[15524.28s -> 15526.28s]  Dude
[15526.28s -> 15534.28s]  Like we shouldn't have made that point mid, because we knew that they were all there, and we knew that our junglers doing this.
[15534.28s -> 15538.28s]  This might just be a jungle diff, honestly.
[15538.28s -> 15544.28s]  Like our AD carry sucks, but it might just be a straight up jungle diff game. They do happen.
[15544.28s -> 15553.34s]  Especially in this era where jungle has so much control of the game, they do happen.
[15553.34s -> 15557.34s]  It's a pretty big jungle diff, you know what I know it.
[15557.34s -> 15561.02s]  But yeah, he's saying yeah, but he knows the jungle is getting out out class
[15562.02s -> 15568.73s]  Insanely hard because Graves counters Lee sin. It's like a massive counter
[15569.33s -> 15573.35s]  But this guy doesn't know what he's doing
[15575.51s -> 15579.87s]  I think he's a Rengar one trick and Rengar got banned. I think that's what's going on
[15581.07s -> 15587.91s]  It's a Rengar one trick who got banned out and he tried to play a champion that requires thought not just the I jump you die champ
[15589.11s -> 15597.38s]  Right and he just gets shit on for it. I mean dude
[15597.38s -> 15599.78s]  I can't even, I can't even do anything this game.
[15601.06s -> 15602.98s]  Our top win was getting his ass whipped to,
[15602.98s -> 15608.69s]  it's really fucking rough.
[15608.69s -> 15611.33s]  I mean, he's in here, I'm pretty sure.
[15611.33s -> 15613.29s]  That's not, it was just, it was warded though.
[15614.65s -> 15616.25s]  I mean, we can't really do anything here.
[15616.25s -> 15617.45s]  I'm dead, I think.
[15618.37s -> 15619.25s]  Yeah, I'm just dead.
[15620.65s -> 15621.69s]  This is just rough.
[15621.69s -> 15624.37s]  I, I kinda wanna go next because I don't think,
[15625.41s -> 15627.81s]  I don't think we have the skill on the team to win.
[15627.81s -> 15651.84s]  I'm just I can't I can't I can't I can't I just can't do anything this game to impact the map and it feels really bad
[15651.84s -> 15664.53s]  Oh, some of which I should have flashed
[15664.53s -> 15672.32s]  I got like pre-blocked a little bit when he knocked me and I like had to walk the rest of the flashed up. That's my man
[15672.32s -> 15680.32s]  Like what was that TP man? Oh god get me out. I'm gonna be a hundred percent real get me out that TP was miserable bad
[15680.32s -> 15682.32s]  Dude just teeped to the wave
[15690.70s -> 15692.90s]  Like what is our blocks doing to like I
[15693.90s -> 15695.90s]  Just feel like everybody's late to the fights
[15697.62s -> 15699.62s]  Lux is always late to the fight
[15700.02s -> 15703.90s]  The graves doesn't want to take fights even though he's playing graves and the leesin
[15704.62s -> 15707.62s]  Like I feel like oh, this is rough. This is a rough game
[15708.54s -> 15712.42s]  Games like this tell me and I kind of just want to go next because games like this
[15712.74s -> 15715.78s]  They are winnable, but I feel like I want to go next to safe mental, you know
[15715.78s -> 15718.78s]  Like a low key. I just want to save my mental
[15728.82s -> 15730.82s]  Because the oh, it's so gross
[15732.34s -> 15736.82s]  Like watching what locks did in the early stages of the lane phase just wasting our Q on repeat
[15736.98s -> 15741.62s]  That was one of the most embarrassing things ever and then like look at that. She just cute a minion
[15753.14s -> 15756.55s]  Oh
[15756.55s -> 15758.55s]  Bro like oh my god
[15759.03s -> 15760.55s]  You got a bunch of the way of men. Oh
[15764.31s -> 15768.58s]  We shits
[15768.58s -> 15776.96s]  I mean I can't even walk. Oh my god
[15778.48s -> 15781.48s]  I don't even have help from my fucking team.
[15781.48s -> 15785.48s]  That's the worst part about this.
[15785.48s -> 15788.48s]  Oh.
[15788.48s -> 15793.48s]  Dude, these games feel so unpuyable, man.
[15793.48s -> 15797.48s]  Like, I don't know how else to say it except for it, they just feel miserable to play.
[15797.48s -> 15802.44s]  Like, I'm trying to focus on playing, like, improving myself.
[15802.44s -> 15807.44s]  But it's so hard to know how to improve in games where, like,
[15807.44s -> 15816.97s]  You genuinely just get no help.
[15816.97s -> 15821.41s]  My watch has been tilted since like minute two for some reason and my grave has been
[15821.41s -> 15825.21s]  completely pathing wrong, doing wrong shit.
[15825.21s -> 15826.21s]  It's hard to know how to help.
[15826.21s -> 15830.05s]  Like I went mid to help, countered two of the early ganks.
[15830.05s -> 15833.82s]  Lux still grief to the game.
[15833.82s -> 15840.22s]  So like yeah, it's just it's hard to know and then top lane wasps.
[15840.22s -> 15846.29s]  It's so rough man.
[15846.29s -> 15848.85s]  Like I'm gonna keep it 100% honest with you.
[15848.85s -> 15853.93s]  If you are a one trick, do not try and play other champs.
[15853.93s -> 15858.92s]  You will int.
[15858.92s -> 15864.44s]  You will play badly always and you will int and you will, you will, like, look at this.
[15864.44s -> 15867.04s]  This is 2.9K damage.
[15867.04s -> 15873.92s]  As a, they're like, what are we doing?
[15873.92s -> 15876.76s]  How are these people getting into this elo?
[15876.76s -> 15880.60s]  How does this lock's like in the game?
[15880.60s -> 15887.36s]  She was against an Alistair bot and she did 1.2.9K damage in a 16,
[15887.36s -> 15895.76s]  game against a melee heavy team. Like what is this? What is happening? This guy was
[15895.76s -> 15909.69s]  D4 30 LP last season and now he's magically in masters. No, we need to fix matchmaking.
[15910.41s -> 15919.44s]  This is this is insane. Like this is just a matchmaking diff. It's nothing else.
[15920.64s -> 15927.28s]  My man literally does not belong in master tier 400 LP MMR at all.
[15927.28s -> 15946.06s]  Why you can see that he's not at this level. Dude, I have the walks player on my team again.
[15954.91s -> 15962.67s]  There's a Xeroath one trick and a Ranger one trick on the enemy team. I don't know, man.
[15963.63s -> 15970.52s]  I guess I care more about the Ranger than the Xeroath, but this is rough.
[15982.99s -> 15987.55s]  Oh, what's up, Chipoppy? Dude, sorry. I hit, yes, on that man. I know the game was winnable.
[15987.55s -> 15991.87s]  I'm gonna be real. But dude, you didn't see what I saw during the early game of that game,
[15991.87s -> 15998.82s]  like, man, the entire early game of that game was like,
[15998.82s -> 16003.82s]  we lost lame because locks wouldn't use her cue
[16003.82s -> 16007.82s]  to fight the Alistair. She was using it to farm minions.
[16007.82s -> 16011.82s]  Like, she was so scared of being engaged on by the Alistair
[16011.82s -> 16016.82s]  in the Colesta that she would use her cue to max range farm minions.
[16016.82s -> 16020.82s]  Instead of save it, so when the Alistair engages, we just kill him.
[16020.82s -> 16026.58s]  Right, because if I was to ever engage us on me and looks, he just gets killed.
[16026.58s -> 16030.38s]  We just bind him, walk away, and he's stuck there, and he dies, right?
[16030.38s -> 16036.14s]  But for some reason, she didn't understand how to do that, so she was just throwing it
[16036.14s -> 16038.34s]  to farm, so we were just getting gaged on.
[16038.34s -> 16042.82s]  So I started roaming, and every time I was like roaming to an objective or something, the
[16042.82s -> 16046.26s]  graves would always walk away and not fight.
[16046.26s -> 16047.62s]  He wasn't attempting to fight.
[16047.62s -> 16051.02s]  He was basically just like, oh, I'm going to go farm some more, but I'm like, dude, you can't
[16051.02s -> 16052.02s]  do that.
[16052.02s -> 16053.94s]  I was just ganking mid and I'm countering mid.
[16053.94s -> 16056.78s]  You can't just farm before coming mid or you can't just like not
[16056.78s -> 16058.22s]  take dragon and shelling that, right?
[16058.22s -> 16062.46s]  Like it blows my mind to that these players can get like it's like this guy too.
[16062.46s -> 16065.22s]  Same thing, like that jungler of last game, right?
[16065.22s -> 16066.22s]  Look at this.
[16066.22s -> 16069.42s]  It's the same thing as the last game, like NA is riddled with this shit and it's
[16069.42s -> 16070.42s]  so miserable to play.
[16070.42s -> 16072.82s]  Look at this, this jungler of last game, right?
[16072.82s -> 16074.82s]  He's not, he's what, like a D1 player, right?
[16074.82s -> 16078.66s]  He's not a bad player, he beats D1, but why is this guy in this game now?
[16078.66s -> 16083.38s]  like art officially inflated to the sealow getting lucky with his first few games and now
[16083.38s -> 16091.65s]  we have to play with this guy. Oh it's an account share. The person it's a different player. Look
[16092.53s -> 16104.21s]  on the account. D flash F flash. So it's a fucking account share. That's that's frustrating.
[16112.00s -> 16115.04s]  Sorry for winding so much guys. This shit's just really frustrating to me.
[16115.04s -> 16123.04s]  But I know I should play it to like specifically only care about like improving and then while you're improving, you'll climb automatically and shit.
[16123.04s -> 16131.04s]  But it's really frustrating when like, the players in the game would rather be idiots and assholes to each other than play the game.
[16131.04s -> 16134.04s]  Right, like the game before the amumu move, right?
[16134.04s -> 16138.04s]  The game before this, the amumu move is being talked to the whole game and entered the winaway.
[16138.04s -> 16143.04s]  The last game, the locks and the graves were being talked to each other, the whole game, we entered the game away.
[16143.04s -> 16151.36s]  It's like it's it's it's not fun to lose because one player gets mad at another player over them both being idiots
[16151.36s -> 16161.01s]  I'm sorry, it's not fun. It's so unfun. But we'll try and we'll try and win this one.
[16161.01s -> 16194.60s]  All we can really do is try and carry the games, right? It's about it. What is? What? What, man? What, what do you think they're gonna do to me?
[16194.60s -> 16198.48s]  Welcome to the league of you think of the seven months man, welcome back
[16198.48s -> 16204.60s]  I really don't want to meet all I don't I don't want to meet all because like I I want to like value the
[16204.60s -> 16220.27s]  Pings and shit, but dude if they walk up. I'm gonna flank him. That's what I'm standing here
[16220.27s -> 16257.10s]  Okay, they're in the main that's a big queue. I need to get level two first here 100%
[16276.15s -> 16278.15s]  I should have just been autoing there that whole time
[16278.15s -> 16286.15s]  because we have heal. So she should have just walked up an auto. As soon as this is what I mean by tracking cooldowns,
[16286.15s -> 16292.15s]  as soon as the Nico missed her, as soon as the Nico missed her cooldown, as soon as she missed her E,
[16292.15s -> 16299.15s]  the Ash should have just walked up and immediately started fighting. Right? Like because they can no longer kill us.
[16299.15s -> 16307.65s]  The Nico doesn't actually have spells outside of her E, right? So if she misses that snare, and she used her W too, right?
[16307.65s -> 16315.25s]  right so it's like we just go ham you don't need to be too scared it happens quite a bit sometimes
[16315.25s -> 16338.04s]  where people will just be like really nervous damn if I had dodge that cue I actually would have
[16338.04s -> 16343.56s]  killed all three damn I don't know if it was worth the flash after the guy I actually I think it was
[16343.56s -> 16348.76s]  if I had dodged the cue I would have been fine so that was that it's whatever I've also
[16348.76s -> 16357.49s]  doesn't miss any creeps here so it's not the end of the world like I'm pretty sure at least
[16357.49s -> 16369.25s]  didn't have his top camps, by the way. If I was a little better mechanically, I turned that, by the way,
[16370.77s -> 16377.40s]  100%. We should push this wave so that I can go get vision.
[16397.78s -> 16426.71s]  Because yeah, that guy can't freeze that wave, so it's not too bad. We send top. You can kind of see some really good,
[16431.33s -> 16454.90s]  what is this? Why's my cart this AFK turret? What is happening right now? Why was he AFK?
[16454.90s -> 16470.26s]  I mean, I guess it worked out, but yeah, maybe I'd go what is cat-out. I don't know
[16472.62s -> 16481.78s]  Happens we do their ballings not very good
[16482.98s -> 16492.44s]  They're trying to hard to force fights that they can't win like they genuinely can't win half these fights that they're trying to force
[16493.76s -> 16499.64s]  Maybe if they were against people who like don't push their buttons, they could win those, but it's like all I have to do is stand there and fight back and they was
[16500.52s -> 16504.50s]  They're on dragon 1000% right now. There's not a lot I can do about that
[16504.96s -> 16509.96s]  and
[16509.96s -> 16511.96s]  we just have to chill
[16511.96s -> 16516.11s]  is almost nothing I can do about it
[16516.11s -> 16520.48s]  cases trying to fake act like she's big but it's
[16520.48s -> 16527.55s]  there's nothing we can do
[16527.55s -> 16530.55s]  because our car this is top so we just chill
[16530.55s -> 16535.31s]  the finish the two of us no no not yet
[16535.31s -> 16537.31s]  oh we said it could be bought right now
[16537.31s -> 16540.31s]  I don't think it's too bad if he's bought though
[16540.31s -> 16557.74s]  they can't really die of us especially with car the salts
[16557.74s -> 16559.74s]  Why is my ash just run?
[16564.68s -> 16567.72s]  She like just straight up runs away. It's kind of silly
[16576.88s -> 16580.22s]  Because we have we have cartless ulti like we can win a five-y-f-erah
[16580.22s -> 16581.88s]  We can win a fight bot right now. I
[16585.62s -> 16588.82s]  Guess I guess I'm just gonna have to get them well enough for cartless to kill them
[16590.42s -> 16592.42s]  Like without the ashes help
[16593.66s -> 16599.25s]  Which I think I can do. It's not too bad. Okay, the call is coming bot
[16600.41s -> 16602.41s]  We just killed them. I mean, it was just fight it
[16602.41s -> 16612.72s]  I don't know why we should just ask her honestly
[16613.52s -> 16623.19s]  Just ask her room. Okay, that was pretty bad asher, but
[16630.56s -> 16633.62s]  Filled I don't think he's filled I think he's just having a bad game
[16635.00s -> 16637.00s]  Like how they it happens, you know
[16637.64s -> 16642.56s]  Whoa, okay
[16642.56s -> 16644.56s]  Do it ult me I fucking dare you
[16645.48s -> 16651.22s]  I'm trying to keep some mana
[16651.50s -> 16653.50s]  So that I can ulti
[16653.50s -> 16677.46s]  Oh, Karthas are to use the Zoltz fuck they both back there. Wow
[16678.24s -> 16688.06s]  My bad. I honestly didn't think they were both gonna back there. Like I thought the kites
[16688.06s -> 16693.42s]  It was gonna back right where I saw her my glass. That's my bad. Hmm, I should be
[16694.94s -> 16701.40s]  I think we send can come bot here and kill me. I should actually stop this guys back
[16706.73s -> 16711.69s]  Yeah, I should stop his back because it's more value to stop the back now even if we send isn't bot
[16711.69s -> 16713.69s]  It's more value
[16713.69s -> 16715.69s]  Cuz he's so low
[16715.69s -> 16719.69s]  Callie is me, I don't know, so we gotta be careful.
[16719.69s -> 16723.69s]  I wasted my ult though, which makes me kinda scared.
[16723.69s -> 16733.87s]  The other thing that kind of sucks about this is we don't have good vision,
[16733.87s -> 16737.87s]  and I can't really help anybody on the map because the same thing is happening as before.
[16737.87s -> 16741.87s]  We're missing opportunities to get kills on timers.
[16741.87s -> 16747.40s]  I mean, the dog lighting guy is playing fine with him.
[16747.40s -> 16751.40s]  I think he's trolled a lot, he's trolling, this isn't like his best game.
[16751.40s -> 16756.40s]  but it's also I don't know why we're getting so tilted around the map right now
[16756.40s -> 16760.40s]  because if I'm if I'm being honest we should just win the game off of like
[16760.40s -> 16774.96s]  being better players I don't know what this car this is thinking but
[16774.96s -> 16781.67s]  do it do it do it do it
[16781.67s -> 16789.00s]  card this we can fight we can fight this fight bro what are we doing
[16789.00s -> 16796.00s]  I'm losing it man ah non a non I'm tilted I'm tilted as fuck he didn't walk in
[16796.00s -> 16799.24s]  Just go on to the Eccali shroud, man.
[16800.52s -> 16802.36s]  I just walk a foot to your right
[16802.36s -> 16804.96s]  and stand on the Eccali shroud.
[16804.96s -> 16806.44s]  She just eats your damage,
[16806.44s -> 16807.88s]  like while she's in the shroud,
[16807.88s -> 16812.95s]  she can't stop that.
[16812.95s -> 16817.00s]  Holy shit, I'm losing my mind.
[16817.00s -> 16819.72s]  Like Ash is just inting bot waves right now,
[16819.72s -> 16821.32s]  not trying to do anything.
[16822.44s -> 16824.12s]  Lux is really far up on CS,
[16824.12s -> 16827.08s]  which is really good, but I'm losing it, man.
[16828.88s -> 16830.52s]  Like we see exactly where they are,
[16830.52s -> 16837.16s]  every game. Like we see where everybody is on the enemy team permanently and we still can't manage to like walk to the right location.
[16838.16s -> 16846.34s]  This is driving me crazy. My my car this 80 my car this jungle is getting out formed
[16847.22s -> 16850.90s]  like a car this jungle is getting out formed by a recent jungle. That's insane.
[16851.98s -> 16854.94s]  Like I don't think I don't think I can stress enough how crazy that is.
[16857.80s -> 16866.49s]  Like there should never be a world where car this ever gets out farms. No way.
[16867.77s -> 16868.29s]  I'm dead.
[16868.81s -> 16874.65s]  You know, way I just fucking ate the end of that. Now I'm playing that just kill the least in man
[16884.24s -> 16886.24s]  I fucked up there
[16886.96s -> 16892.68s]  That was my fault because I got hit by the tip of the that was my fault. I got barely equipped by the tip of the nickel
[16892.68s -> 16894.48s]  Once when I was trying to space because I'm bad
[16895.20s -> 16899.08s]  And if I was alive there and I could have saved my flash for the least in queue we just win
[16899.40s -> 16905.27s]  I am confused that why we decided to like not fight that immediately though
[16905.27s -> 16909.91s]  Like we caught out to their members and we just got scared for whatever reason
[16910.47s -> 16912.47s]  Wait, we win this fight
[16912.47s -> 16914.31s]  With the 1000% win this fight this fight this fight this
[16928.76s -> 16931.24s]  Bro, do not throw a fucking temper tantrum right now
[16931.96s -> 16934.60s]  There's one kill do not throw a temper tantrum
[16938.09s -> 16940.09s]  Oh my god, here we go
[16940.09s -> 16942.81s]  I took one kill the guys about the losing mind guys
[16951.54s -> 16954.42s]  I need to mute all I'm gonna mute all in a second
[16955.78s -> 16958.10s]  Like I can't put these people right now
[16961.26s -> 16965.82s]  Like I can't smell. New people are disgusting like you guys just
[16966.78s -> 16971.42s]  Wine you play bad you wine and you bitch about every little mistake that everything happens
[16971.66s -> 16978.54s]  Even though it's like in the middle of a fight I guarantee him a better player than you are and you're still winding and crying over one shutdown that like
[16979.18s -> 16985.34s]  You didn't even walk to until I spam pinged you like I literally won't be to them. You hit one e and then you're mad
[16988.17s -> 16990.97s]  Dude, I swear league players are fucking psychopaths
[16995.59s -> 16997.11s]  At least I got the exhaust off
[16997.27s -> 17004.31s]  Surely she dies, right? Surely she dies there. Or not. Okay. Okay, I'm least she died.
[17006.15s -> 17014.44s]  Help each other guys. Help each other teamwork teamwork teamwork teamwork teamwork teamwork
[17019.67s -> 17031.05s]  Wait, this ash isn't saying okay, I'm not gonna lie that ash played that so good. I only saw the end of it and she still played that good
[17031.05s -> 17041.44s]  That was sick. Well, well done. That was actually really good. She almost stopped the dive.
[17041.44s -> 17052.64s]  That's crazy. This game is definitely 1,000% still winable though. We just have to play
[17052.64s -> 17059.44s]  4 late game and not lose our fucking minds. I'll let that push back into my ash. I'll go mid, get some vision.
[17059.44s -> 17063.92s]  That's pretty much all we have to do.
[17063.92s -> 17075.68s]  Quite for wait and not lose our mind early. We could play to kill this a collar right now. She doesn't know there's no ward here.
[17075.68s -> 17114.20s]  We could also invade here. Oh that's so unlucky. That was such a close queue. Kill that guy. Jesus Christ.
[17114.20s -> 17124.39s]  I feel like we should have won that fight. I felt like something awkward happened and we lost.
[17124.39s -> 17131.97s]  Did my ash just walk directly into this a call and not use her ulti use your ulti you have ulti use your ulti. Oh
[17132.61s -> 17142.00s]  Oh my god
[17142.00s -> 17146.53s]  What the fuck oh, oh my god
[17148.41s -> 17152.45s]  I don't even know what to say right now. This is insane
[17154.25s -> 17159.25s]  This genuinely feels like everybody in the game is losing their mind in the freest game I've ever seen in my life
[17163.58s -> 17166.02s]  Like that's what we're losing to right there that guy
[17166.90s -> 17174.26s]  The guy who like doesn't understand how Santa works like that player. That's why I'm frustrated like that player right there
[17175.30s -> 17177.30s]  has no idea how Santa works
[17177.62s -> 17180.74s]  tries to fight me and we're like losing to that guy
[17181.62s -> 17185.70s]  Like I'm trying really hard not to be an asshole, but like it's flooding out right now from these games
[17188.10s -> 17197.24s]  It's crazy but he's so toxic look at this he went pro-do belt I only a boot
[17199.88s -> 17203.32s]  Nico, but like what that doesn't do anything to help his team
[17218.98s -> 17221.38s]  You could arrow that guy. I mean, it's not impossible
[17223.46s -> 17225.46s]  Or don't that's fine. Oh
[17236.07s -> 17243.09s]  My god
[17243.09s -> 17245.09s]  Guys, I think my locks is a okay
[17247.99s -> 17249.99s]  She's been sitting in base for like five minutes
[17256.47s -> 17258.47s]  I think she's like
[17258.47s -> 17260.47s]  Literally just throwing or some chips
[17261.11s -> 17273.44s]  Let's push the Swift
[17273.44s -> 17275.44s]  We could make a pick right now
[17275.44s -> 17298.68s]  Jacks, what are you doing man? Why are you up there? Oh, no. Also, why does this ash have the worst build I've ever seen? Dude, if we lose to the kaisa that just did that, I'm gonna lose my mind
[17314.80s -> 17318.56s]  But like I just blind art in without any vision of anybody and just died
[17319.36s -> 17321.36s]  There's no way we can lose this
[17321.60s -> 17332.29s]  We got this guys, just play like I just need to I need help getting vision control on Baron and
[17332.85s -> 17384.29s]  Mid and then we can we can win we got this right now
[17416.61s -> 17421.34s]  I mean, we still got Baron, but he did get two of them, I guess.
[17421.34s -> 17424.74s]  Or no, only, yeah, you got Cardus and Ash.
[17424.74s -> 17433.81s]  But we did get Baron, which is very nice.
[17433.81s -> 17436.01s]  I'm going to go Dom's this game.
[17436.01s -> 17453.88s]  I'm like, oh, Black Cleaver, but I think I'm going to go Dom's.
[17453.88s -> 17470.73s]  I need to get Vision Control on Dragon and Min.
[17470.73s -> 17474.73s]  I need to get Vision Control, and I need help to do it, though.
[17474.73s -> 17483.92s]  I'm going to act like I'm backing here.
[17483.92s -> 17486.64s]  We should just be pushing mid with Baron. I don't know what we're doing.
[17488.32s -> 17491.28s]  Like, like, Loki, it should just be straight up like we go mid with Baron here.
[17502.99s -> 17504.75s]  The fuck was that? That was a terrible play.
[17522.08s -> 17524.00s]  Guys, just just come mid, we have Baron.
[17533.90s -> 17536.06s]  Nice, huge peck. Pushmen, pushmen.
[17537.58s -> 17538.62s]  Fuck dragon, just pushmen.
[17545.76s -> 17546.64s]  Get now we back off.
[17551.12s -> 17554.48s]  Oh, I mean, that was bad.
[17557.62s -> 17559.30s]  Guys, back off, back off, back off, back off, we've...
[17559.30s -> 17569.72s]  Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, guys, you can leave, you can leave, we just go to Dragon, please.
[17569.72s -> 17578.70s]  We still have so much gold to get on the map, we can go get bot to your two, bot to your one, bot to your two.
[17578.70s -> 17581.70s]  We have so much gold to get on the map, it's not a big deal, right?
[17581.70s -> 17583.70s]  Like we don't need to end the game right the second.
[17583.70s -> 17589.70s]  We actually have Kartis and we have Jacks too, so like our scaling is really good.
[17589.70s -> 17635.08s]  I need to go get, I need to go get my next item, but I need enough gold to get.
[17635.08s -> 17641.64s]  them but I need enough gold to do it. I also need to get words. The sucks. I'm
[17641.64s -> 17645.96s]  like a weird by timer where I don't have enough things to get, you know what? I'm
[17645.96s -> 17650.04s]  just going to get my ward item. I'm gonna grab this for now. Just so we can actually
[17650.04s -> 17654.20s]  get some power on the map. Because the map's so dark and I think getting the ward
[17654.20s -> 17663.50s]  item before finishing my last whisper items is probably the smartest call. I am a little
[17663.50s -> 17669.10s]  concerned why we're not pushing bot with jacks. We're pushing top. And I'm also
[17669.10s -> 17674.10s]  So concerned why we're not playing for mid-prior and we're just farming bot side.
[17676.10s -> 17678.10s]  This is such an awkward fucking thing.
[17684.50s -> 17687.50s]  We should just be playing for mid-prior and use a arrow to engage.
[17687.50s -> 17688.50s]  That's how we win.
[17688.50s -> 17690.50s]  We just use a arrow to engage when they can test mid.
[17691.50s -> 17692.50s]  It's actually that easy.
[17699.68s -> 17701.68s]  Like, okay, it's actually that easy.
[17701.68s -> 17709.86s]  See? Watch, now this guy's dead.
[17717.93s -> 17718.93s]  I mean, that's fine with me.
[17720.93s -> 17722.93s]  You guys want to kill me? That's totally fine.
[17722.93s -> 17741.10s]  they can get the inhib and then they can back up. Yeah, I get inhib back up and
[17742.10s -> 17751.26s]  then play for play for Baron. They'll only have a few seconds to do this though, so it's kind of scary because these two are gonna be alive
[17757.23s -> 17759.23s]  They need to back immediately
[17759.69s -> 17765.95s]  Just reset you don't need the way. Just leave. Leave. We've
[17766.59s -> 17769.03s]  Barren's up. Barren's up. Think about the macro as the macro
[17769.87s -> 17774.02s]  We play for Baron now
[17774.02s -> 17781.52s]  Because there's a timer now where like you guys just need to reset because there's a timer where the enemy has tempo on the map and if we don't
[17783.02s -> 17785.02s]  If we don't allow
[17785.52s -> 17807.02s]  If we don't reset they'll just rush barren and there's nothing we can do about it. Okay, they're not on barren. I think they missed their timer. They're on it. No, they're on it. They're on it. Okay, they're not on it. We're fun.
[17812.93s -> 17824.86s]  We can still fight this though, but we need everybody here. Just arrow arrow arrow arrow.
[17824.86s -> 17829.74s]  Arrow, it doesn't matter if you hit mouth, just arrow. Just arrow him. Thank you
[17836.02s -> 17838.06s]  No, no guys the back line the back line
[17840.92s -> 17842.92s]  Play together play together. Yes
[17845.18s -> 17853.31s]  Nice end of the game you end you end here
[17854.47s -> 17856.47s]  Walks don't back
[17856.47s -> 17864.17s]  You are giving me cancer. Okay, they forfeit it dude. Look how easy that is look how easy it is the win games when people are listening to macro
[17864.17s -> 17867.37s]  Look how easy it is! Oh my god!
[17868.97s -> 17875.81s]  I'm losing it man. I swear to God, I'm losing my- I can feel my hair falling out right now. I can feel it falling out on my fucking head.
[17875.81s -> 17881.45s]  Like I just lost the one that's right there, but like it's just fucking killing me, man.
[17882.09s -> 17887.89s]  In game. God, it's so hard. I feel so exhausted.
[17888.25s -> 17890.25s]  Like it's so exhausting.
[17894.84s -> 17897.60s]  You put a 44 minute gold game. God damn.
[17898.36s -> 17906.56s]  That's impressive. I don't want to honor any of these people. Who would you guys honor?
[17907.46s -> 17912.72s]  Like out of all of them, who would you guys pick? Because I don't know. They also in my eyes. I'm too toxic right now. They all suck
[17916.04s -> 17922.99s]  Jacks. All right, I'll give it to Jacks. Ash. Ash was trying. I'll give you that. Ash was trying.
[17923.39s -> 17928.56s]  Dude, look at this looks
[17928.96s -> 17939.47s]  This looks got so fucking carried. Oh my god
[17940.91s -> 17943.31s]  Don't type to me you
[17943.31s -> 17948.67s]  You put Destrian.
[17948.67s -> 17958.80s]  Smink all of them up a Destrian.
[17958.80s -> 17961.80s]  That's not even an insult.
[17961.80s -> 17963.80s]  Like, oh yeah, yeah, wow.
[17963.80s -> 17965.80s]  Fucking pedestrian.
[17965.80s -> 17972.16s]  Like, this is not even an insult, man.
[17972.16s -> 17989.36s]  There it is.
[17989.36s -> 17993.36s]  Guys, I feel like part of my life gets taken away, you know?
[17993.36s -> 17995.36s]  Like when I play in my main account,
[17995.36s -> 17998.36s]  and I'm like super sweaty, try harding and shit.
[17998.36s -> 18000.36s]  I feel like I'm losing, like, yeah, it's like,
[18000.36s -> 18004.76s]  It's like every time I lose, it's like one hair or like every time I'm like barely win
[18004.92s -> 18010.56s]  Right, it's just like every game in this he looks like one hair on my head gets fucking burnt out and it just leaves
[18010.56s -> 18037.49s]  And I'm not like I'm gonna get like a Homer Simpson like look at the difference in wards placed. This is what annoys me about bad support players
[18038.19s -> 18040.19s]  This guy placed 23
[18040.99s -> 18044.79s]  He's more focused on getting kills than placing wards and it's really stupid
[18044.79s -> 18059.44s]  So I just don't like some, I don't have anything against the dog lightning guy as a person other than like what I've seen on his stream right like on a stream
[18059.62s -> 18061.62s]  He just seems really ego-tistical
[18062.90s -> 18068.58s]  Like he's like everything I hate in the average league player. He's he has a massive ego
[18069.46s -> 18076.54s]  Because he reached Challenger on the support role on like an off-met-up pick like last year at some point or something or maybe he's Challenger right now
[18076.54s -> 18077.54s]  I don't even know
[18077.54s -> 18082.58s]  Maybe he has an account in Challenger. I don't even know but it drives me crazy because like
[18083.14s -> 18089.04s]  He doesn't do anything correctly. Like he gets away with such dumb shit
[18089.56s -> 18094.20s]  Because he like he like basically wins lane because he plays extremely aggressively
[18094.72s -> 18101.76s]  But if you guys noticed in that game the reason we won lane or we were able to push back is because they they played aggressively
[18101.76s -> 18106.32s]  But they did it really stupidly like they were fighting us in our own waves
[18106.32s -> 18113.72s]  right, like on repeat, they were just fighting us in our own waves. Every time I would just turn a one for one, almost the one for two every time.
[18113.72s -> 18117.72s]  And it's it's stupid because every time that's happening, they're also giving me souls, right?
[18117.72s -> 18122.12s]  And even like take weird fights and like, I know he's probably forepawning. He doesn't carry.
[18122.12s -> 18128.32s]  It's a smurf blah blah blah blah. But I just don't like when people like that like ego they're ass off when they play so badly.
[18129.32s -> 18138.45s]  It drives me crazy. Why do I care so much? I don't know. I don't know.
[18138.45s -> 18161.60s]  Now, how are you guys doing, by the way?
[18161.60s -> 18163.12s]  How's everybody's day going in chat?
[18163.12s -> 18165.32s]  What'd you guys up to, talk to me?
[18165.32s -> 18167.04s]  I know I stopped like teaching the game
[18167.04s -> 18169.08s]  and started the mining, like I got on my main account
[18169.08s -> 18171.04s]  a few hours ago, and I stopped teaching,
[18171.04s -> 18172.16s]  and I started the mining a bunch.
[18172.16s -> 18180.43s]  So, my bad, my bad on that one, dude's.
[18180.43s -> 18181.43s]  How are you guys doing though?
[18181.43s -> 18189.60s]  How's everybody's day going?
[18189.60s -> 18191.00s]  When is the coaching surface open?
[18191.00s -> 18195.20s]  Oh, I could probably do coaching at some point soon.
[18196.16s -> 18198.40s]  Like, I'd be willing to do some coaching,
[18198.40s -> 18211.94s]  So my subcouching or something or like something like that, it might be fun.
[18211.94s -> 18213.94s]  So I mean, bronze, you don't get enough time to actually improve.
[18213.94s -> 18214.94s]  Dude, I feel that man.
[18214.94s -> 18216.06s]  It takes a long time.
[18216.06s -> 18219.94s]  What he does not an easy game to pick up and start playing, right?
[18219.94s -> 18222.50s]  Like if you're in bronze or silver and you're like, oh, I actually,
[18222.50s -> 18223.58s]  you know, I'm having fun playing the game.
[18223.58s -> 18225.22s]  I kind of want to try and get better.
[18225.22s -> 18227.26s]  It's you're just overwhelmed with so much info
[18227.26s -> 18230.62s]  that you like have to play so many games, right?
[18230.62s -> 18235.61s]  I feel you, man.
[18235.61s -> 18245.66s]  Like it's overwhelming.
[18245.66s -> 18256.20s]  Yeah, I feel you.
[18256.20s -> 18258.44s]  Well, we got mid, okay.
[18258.44s -> 18263.22s]  Ah, sorry, just by trust.
[18263.22s -> 18265.94s]  Well, more if I pick trust that we won't have AP,
[18265.94s -> 18270.22s]  but I also think I'm better at trust than I am at like,
[18270.22s -> 18271.18s]  other stuff.
[18272.26s -> 18280.01s]  So I don't know.
[18280.01s -> 18281.69s]  AP Varus.
[18281.69s -> 18284.01s]  I'm not good enough at AP Varus, man.
[18284.01s -> 18287.74s]  I'm gonna be real.
[18287.74s -> 18289.06s]  Well, my mouse is good,
[18289.06s -> 18290.20s]  but the problem with mouse is like,
[18290.20s -> 18292.26s]  mouse is a shitty champion.
[18292.26s -> 18293.34s]  Like, mouse is trash, right?
[18293.34s -> 18298.94s]  So he's good, but he's not good in the sense of like,
[18298.94s -> 18301.94s]  I can play him well, but at the end of the day,
[18301.94s -> 18305.30s]  if they pick something that like counters malls,
[18305.30s -> 18309.16s]  I just lose.
[18309.16s -> 18312.40s]  Or is like Tristan has just free to pick.
[18312.40s -> 18314.56s]  Like, even if we play all AD, right?
[18314.56s -> 18315.92s]  Let's say we do all AD or some shit,
[18315.92s -> 18319.08s]  like on accidents or because people are one tracks, blah, blah, blah.
[18319.08s -> 18320.56s]  It's still free.
[18320.56s -> 18322.76s]  Like Tristan is still like a good pick.
[18322.76s -> 18324.40s]  Because even with all AD,
[18324.40s -> 18327.00s]  She's still like you can build Lord Dom's.
[18327.00s -> 18329.48s]  She has incredibly high pressure or a game
[18329.48s -> 18330.36s]  if you play her right, right?
[18330.36s -> 18332.52s]  You could push the waves, Rome.
[18332.52s -> 18335.00s]  You can roam top, rum, bot, help lanes out,
[18335.00s -> 18336.84s]  like level two, three, you can evade jungler,
[18336.84s -> 18341.79s]  or is there really, she's just incredibly, incredibly strong.
[18341.79s -> 18342.87s]  This guy should go Pike.
[18344.27s -> 18347.55s]  I was gonna say they picked Nunu and I picked an 80 mid.
[18347.55s -> 18350.47s]  They picked Nunu and Thresh.
[18350.47s -> 18354.59s]  We should have an engage because Pike Trist,
[18354.59s -> 18356.67s]  Like I can just walk a bot on repeat now
[18356.67s -> 18369.04s]  and pretty much kill people watching Iron Game.
[18369.04s -> 18371.32s]  Watching an Iron Game, I feel like it wouldn't be an actual
[18371.32s -> 18375.89s]  Iron Game though, wouldn't it?
[18375.89s -> 18378.85s]  I've heard I had friends who intentionally lost a bunch
[18378.85s -> 18383.85s]  of games and so they could get to Iron 4, right?
[18383.85s -> 18385.39s]  They like, they like, into down that,
[18385.39s -> 18388.41s]  to Iron 4, whatever, to see if they could make it.
[18388.41s -> 18393.41s]  And there's just so many, like, smurf's in Iron.
[18393.41s -> 18402.29s]  in iron. There's like legitimate bot, bot accounts, like accounts that are like being
[18402.29s -> 18407.17s]  botted, right? There's like bot of the accounts in iron. There's like smurf's all over the place.
[18415.76s -> 18420.08s]  It seems so stops. I wonder if Riot like did something that stopped the bots?
[18421.60s -> 18424.88s]  They must, they may have, like they may have just been incorporated something that like stops
[18424.88s -> 18433.92s]  to the software, but I don't know. I haven't heard anything about it, but I have no clue.
[18433.92s -> 18461.97s]  I'll be real. I don't know. You had to take a fall. You were on my last game. I got boots one.
[18461.97s -> 18478.37s]  That sounds awful. I kind of feel bad for actual iron players who are like in iron trying to climb because like that sounds bad.
[18478.37s -> 18496.90s]  I do think you can climb obviously out of any yellow. It doesn't matter. If I were to go into an iron game,
[18496.90s -> 18504.04s]  I'd probably drop like 50 kills. But I, so I do think you can climb out of any, you know, any yellow.
[18504.04s -> 18523.74s]  For sure, you're loving a new account if you guys got a bottom account that answered every time I wrote bot
[18530.68s -> 18542.33s]  That's funny. Yeah, I assume that's a good point. I guess if you're in iron
[18542.53s -> 18548.65s]  You could like play to learn the game of it better and then you could like play a new account and see where you got. Yeah, I know that would work
[18549.65s -> 18560.36s]  That makes sense. Sure. I'll first pick man. I'll first pick Sanna. I
[18560.36s -> 18577.50s]  I guarantee they've all can fucking, these people are gonna walk in fucking, uh, not a list or some shits, it'll be like jarvin, not a list, uh, I don't even know.
[18577.50s -> 18591.46s]  Ribbons not too bad, we're saying, so it's okay to be at flanks. I actually don't think Ribbons too bad right now. Maybe all the Ribbon players I've played against suck, but I don't think she's actually that bad.
[18591.46s -> 18596.82s]  I think Revin's like just you have to position well. I think Revin's really broken at
[18596.82s -> 18601.86s]  abusing positioning. That's why she's so good. It's so cute. Like good Revin players
[18601.86s -> 18607.30s]  I'll get really gross flanks and the flanks are what's OP. Yeah, there's the gragas. Okay,
[18607.30s -> 18613.24s]  I was like they're gonna pick something to fuck me over. This guy picked Gregus, but it was gonna be
[18613.24s -> 18618.36s]  like J4 or Gregus or something. And then this guy is the support help our Pignottolis.
[18618.36s -> 18623.12s]  Unless he's a one trick, right?
[18623.12s -> 18625.20s]  Unless this guy's straight up just like a one trick,
[18625.20s -> 18629.52s]  he'll pick like notalists or some shits.
[18629.52s -> 18635.62s]  Maybe Rekon, Rekon or notalists,
[18635.62s -> 18636.86s]  because if he picks him in Chancer,
[18636.86s -> 18642.09s]  we just win the game.
[18642.09s -> 18647.50s]  He has to pick and gauge.
[18647.50s -> 18649.82s]  Mirio would be really good here, too, actually.
[18651.18s -> 18653.70s]  Because Mirio would counter half our team.
[18653.70s -> 18657.26s]  You can Mirio Q, Woo-Kong, and Ken and then Gage.
[18658.82s -> 18660.06s]  Like if this guy put Mirio,
[18660.06s -> 18663.68s]  And then it should actually be a hard line.
[18663.68s -> 18668.47s]  Tom Kinch?
[18668.47s -> 18670.23s]  I mean, I get it.
[18670.23s -> 18671.39s]  But I think it's bad.
[18673.03s -> 18674.59s]  Rins, oh shit.
[18675.55s -> 18679.43s]  Yo, you just saved me looking like an absolute fool.
[18679.43s -> 18680.27s]  Thank you.
[18681.67s -> 18682.67s]  Holy crap.
[18682.67s -> 18683.91s]  If you wanted to see my Rins, they're here,
[18683.91s -> 18684.99s]  but thank you, you reminded me.
[18684.99s -> 18686.51s]  I'm gonna be happy, I'm gonna get some water.
[18686.51s -> 18687.95s]  I'll be right back.
[18687.95s -> 18728.81s]  Get some agua.
[18728.81s -> 18729.77s]  By the way, the people who are here
[18729.77s -> 18731.29s]  to watch me play 80, 30.
[18731.29s -> 18743.14s]  I sincerely apologize, I know watching me play Senna is probably boring as fuck, okay?
[18743.14s -> 18750.14s]  I know, and I promise you, we will play 80 carry at some point, I promise you.
[18750.14s -> 18754.14s]  I played like the first four hours of the stream was 80 carry out the first three, right?
[18754.14s -> 18758.14s]  I put on my smurf for a few games and played some 80, so if you want to watch that, you can go back in the bottom.
[18758.14s -> 18761.14s]  We did some my commentary and shit.
[18761.14s -> 18765.30s]  The only reason I'm playing so much sent on and support on this account is because like
[18766.26s -> 18771.48s]  They're the hero I'm currently in is like the worst hero to climb in solcu because of a
[18772.10s -> 18774.10s]  lot of factors and
[18774.58s -> 18777.10s]  Support has some of the highest impact on the game
[18779.26s -> 18785.62s]  Whereas like 80 career as high impact of late, but in solcu you want to have high impact early and I wanted to be able to
[18786.78s -> 18812.86s]  Impact the game really early on so yeah, sorry about being you know boring and shit
[18812.86s -> 18823.42s]  But I just really want to win games.
[18823.42s -> 18826.62s]  At least on this account, I want to get out of the COO,
[18826.62s -> 18829.02s]  because the faster I get out of the COO,
[18829.02s -> 18847.14s]  the faster I can have fun point 80 carry and like,
[18847.14s -> 18853.54s]  trink on what a weird play by these guys.
[18853.54s -> 18854.90s]  What the fuck?
[18854.90s -> 18861.02s]  They like half shoved the waves to get like early bush control.
[18861.02s -> 18872.49s]  And then I do shit like that.
[18872.49s -> 18873.33s]  This guy's just dead.
[18873.33s -> 18878.64s]  I'm gonna give it to Twitch.
[18878.64s -> 18880.44s]  Nice, we got his exhausts.
[18880.44s -> 18882.00s]  So I wasted my exhaust there.
[18882.00s -> 18883.84s]  I did it because I thought the jinx was gonna
[18883.84s -> 18885.04s]  insta flash.
[18886.80s -> 18889.64s]  Well, I didn't exhaust because I was like scared of her damage.
[18889.64s -> 18891.44s]  I did it because I thought she was gonna like
[18891.44s -> 18893.60s]  try and flash away the second fits.
[18895.28s -> 18896.80s]  But I reminded my snare.
[18896.80s -> 18897.80s]  It was kinda bad by me.
[18897.80s -> 18899.80s]  I mean, I landed my snare so I didn't need to exhaust her.
[18899.80s -> 18902.08s]  I just was like, oh, maybe she'll flash.
[18902.08s -> 18902.92s]  She did not.
[18902.92s -> 18911.60s]  not flash. What he was this, the 500 LP masters 400 LP. It's insane, I know.
[18911.60s -> 18948.92s]  Absolutely crazy. Put that ward there because Greg is probably bot. Yeah. So, they're
[18948.92s -> 18954.60s]  trying to come up from bot to kill me here. Like their bot names rotating up to
[18954.60s -> 18956.60s]  trying to kill me.
[18956.60s -> 18962.04s]  So, just be careful, Twitch, they're in here, man.
[18962.04s -> 18965.04s]  I actually have to back and walk, look.
[18965.04s -> 18976.18s]  This is hilarious. The enemy bot lane literally is roaming mid.
[18976.18s -> 18977.18s]  Look at this.
[18977.18s -> 18981.06s]  What?
[18981.06s -> 18984.91s]  Why?
[18984.91s -> 18990.95s]  I'm not trying to soak his XP, I just want those souls.
[18990.95s -> 19005.89s]  I'm scared to walk in here. I don't know where Greg is.
[19005.89s -> 19011.35s]  I got to come bot to help my Twitch, so they don't freeze the wave.
[19011.35s -> 19015.86s]  Like, I don't want them to be able to freeze here.
[19015.86s -> 19020.17s]  Even if Braggets Ganks, we win the fight right now.
[19020.17s -> 19022.13s]  Like, uh, it's an easy fight when.
[19022.13s -> 19032.14s]  As long as we don't get knocked up, we just win the fight automatically.
[19032.14s -> 19035.66s]  Actually, we're trying to bait Braggets to come Gank this.
[19035.66s -> 19044.74s]  Easy.
[19044.74s -> 19051.38s]  Double Flash is very easy.
[19051.38s -> 19053.38s]  You fucking cowards.
[19053.38s -> 19066.40s]  We should back up.
[19066.40s -> 19068.04s]  Like, I can go buy now.
[19068.04s -> 19069.72s]  Oh, Braggets is top.
[19069.72s -> 19073.40s]  We could actually maybe do Dragon.
[19073.40s -> 19077.56s]  Yo, I'm a real ace-old roaming is not a- not in the top list of me being like,
[19077.56s -> 19081.02s]  like nervous about it.
[19081.02s -> 19086.46s]  Like I'm not nervous about a soul roaming man.
[19086.46s -> 19090.02s]  Push this so we can overdiving them?
[19090.02s -> 19090.90s]  That's a bit scary.
[19090.90s -> 19094.46s]  Welcome to the League of Draven.
[19094.46s -> 19097.22s]  Good to see you back to enjoying the game.
[19097.22s -> 19098.82s]  Whoa, we're going still diving that?
[19098.82s -> 19100.42s]  That's not good.
[19100.42s -> 19107.12s]  Like we back off here, man.
[19107.12s -> 19115.50s]  I mean, we can maybe go up here if you really want to.
[19115.50s -> 19123.50s]  I kind of want to award this.
[19123.50s -> 19130.51s]  I need to reset the really badly right now.
[19130.51s -> 19132.51s]  Like really bad with it.
[19133.51s -> 19136.51s]  Not being on the map here is really bad.
[19137.51s -> 19141.51s]  Or rather not like having gold spent and being on the map is what I'm gonna say.
[19141.51s -> 19142.51s]  Like it's really fucking bad.
[19143.51s -> 19144.51s]  Yo, back up.
[19144.51s -> 19147.51s]  You know Greg is that you watched him walk past three wards.
[19148.51s -> 19149.51s]  That's why I just wanted.
[19149.51s -> 19150.51s]  No no, he's still here.
[19151.51s -> 19152.51s]  Greg is right there.
[19154.51s -> 19156.51s]  We know Greg is just somewhere about lane right now.
[19156.51s -> 19158.51s]  I don't know where, but we know he's there.
[19158.51s -> 19167.29s]  They're on dragon. Okay, we can fight this go. We'll go
[19168.29s -> 19186.59s]  W over I'm here nice yo, come here
[19188.09s -> 19190.85s]  Yo, I'll help you come get the move first blue
[19192.77s -> 19228.20s]  I got you baby what the fuck made a bitch. Oh, I guess I'll back
[19230.08s -> 19232.88s]  Yo, Spartan thank you for the six months man walk it back
[19232.88s -> 19240.64s]  I'll go back, or shade it, this will back, we'll get our fucking umbral, I'm going
[19240.64s -> 19244.84s]  to go top side of the map now and I'm going to help my team get refterials.
[19244.84s -> 19256.42s]  I'm going to ping, I want to go top side, I want to help my team get refts.
[19256.42s -> 19259.82s]  The wave, if we look at Bot Wave, it's pushing into us, it's totally fine.
[19259.82s -> 19267.10s]  Okay, twitch is level 6, the Bot Wave's pushing in, we are totally fine to do what I'm
[19267.10s -> 19273.63s]  doing right now.
[19273.63s -> 19286.65s]  He doesn't know I'm here. I'm dead though.
[19293.57s -> 19294.57s]  Rhoh.
[19294.57s -> 19299.39s]  No joke. I almost juked that.
[19300.39s -> 19301.39s]  That's so close.
[19301.39s -> 19305.39s]  I was hoping, like, we'll call him for some reason. Didn't walk top time.
[19306.39s -> 19308.39s]  Uh, but the enemy bot lane dead?
[19309.39s -> 19316.75s]  Okay. The enemy bot lane just grief their entire game. The game's over. We win.
[19316.75s -> 19319.75s]  What the fuck are they doing? What is happening?
[19319.75s -> 19324.45s]  Like my Twitch is just getting free place.
[19324.45s -> 19331.54s]  Wait, you guys are griefing.
[19331.54s -> 19341.06s]  I'm griefing.
[19341.06s -> 19343.26s]  Dude, what the fuck?
[19343.26s -> 19346.26s]  We, why would you fight them?
[19346.26s -> 19349.26s]  Guys, guys, guys, we'll con.
[19349.26s -> 19351.26s]  We'll con.
[19351.26s -> 19355.46s]  Okay, we see that our Twitch is getting free plates, but free first to it.
[19355.46s -> 19357.26s]  Okay, I'm back.
[19357.26s -> 19359.46s]  I almost sold their 80 carry, okay?
[19359.46s -> 19360.46s]  Or their jungler.
[19360.46s -> 19366.26s]  Why would you ever, on purpose, take a four-of-fight like that
[19366.26s -> 19370.66s]  with no, oh, I've cancer. I've also
[19371.38s -> 19376.42s]  The WooCone's an idiot. He doesn't understand macro at all apparently because I literally
[19376.74s -> 19380.02s]  Pings to come to Rift my WooCone was like nervous
[19381.06s -> 19389.10s]  Like for some reason WooCone didn't walk top. He sat bot trying to gank, but the objective was Rift not
[19391.42s -> 19394.78s]  God, I'm losing my mind in the seal. Master's players are
[19394.78s -> 19399.18s]  are literally just diamond players with slightly better mechanics.
[19399.18s -> 19400.94s]  They don't know anything about the game,
[19400.94s -> 19405.64s]  and I'm about to my brains about to explode like a peanut.
[19405.64s -> 19407.60s]  It's not about them leaning to V2.
[19407.60s -> 19409.20s]  You fucking come quad.
[19410.60s -> 19412.76s]  Dude, I know they can't leaning against us to V2.
[19412.76s -> 19414.52s]  It's not about the 2V2 man.
[19414.52s -> 19418.00s]  We get a free ref-terald because we shut down their bot lane
[19418.00s -> 19419.48s]  and I'm on an item spike.
[19419.48s -> 19421.92s]  So we just automatically get a free reft.
[19421.92s -> 19426.89s]  It has nothing to do with 2V2.
[19426.89s -> 19437.05s]  This come quad mother fucker I don't know why that's my insult. The pedestrian guy got to me
[19439.25s -> 19447.94s]  Somehow
[19447.94s -> 19449.94s]  For the fuck is this word? Oh
[19455.86s -> 19460.86s]  Because I'm telling you right now my Macro there was a hundred percent correct by the way like 1,000 percent
[19471.11s -> 19475.43s]  Like even though I died, I know it was correct. No. No, just do dragon. Do not die
[19476.43s -> 19479.75s]  Guys, we don't have to not everything's about kills not everything's about kills. We got this
[19479.75s -> 19484.31s]  like you don't need to dive you don't need to dive always you don't need to see it killed be like
[19484.31s -> 19489.99s]  ooh monkey kill brand go like the game is about like getting objectives on timers and
[19489.99s -> 19495.43s]  playing off of tempo and things like that like there are only reason we even lost Rift was
[19495.43s -> 19500.55s]  because my Wukong went full monkey brand and was like no we need to not play for this Rift with
[19500.55s -> 19502.39s]  with a giant massively,
[19522.66s -> 19523.50s]  wait, kill this guy.
[19528.73s -> 19530.09s]  One of my watching right now.
[19532.29s -> 19533.57s]  This is outrageous.
[19533.57s -> 19535.65s]  My Wukong is solo, altered there.
[19535.65s -> 19536.49s]  Dude, I'm gonna lose it.
[19536.49s -> 19549.90s]  My Wukong is solo, altered their grggess.
[19549.90s -> 19550.98s]  On a good note though,
[19552.30s -> 19553.94s]  they don't get any plates off of rifting,
[19553.94s -> 19555.18s]  so it's not that bad.
[19556.90s -> 19557.98s]  Okay man, just push.
[19557.98s -> 19562.15s]  Dude, hit the minions, it's like, it's not.
[19562.15s -> 19562.99s]  My bad.
[19562.99s -> 19569.85s]  Sorry, I'm wound up right now, Canon. Okay. I'm a little wound. Apologies if I if I
[19569.85s -> 19578.63s]  grief too, man. It's fine. So the wound up is fine. I just don't like when like
[19578.63s -> 19582.43s]  stuff like that happens. I'm a perfectionist and it's my big, oh, I talk about
[19582.43s -> 19588.07s]  the story. I'm a perfectionist. My biggest flaw is that like I will play the game
[19588.07s -> 19592.59s]  100% correctly on like tempo and timers, but you can't do that because you got
[19592.59s -> 19595.27s]  I gotta remember too, like your teammates or teammates.
[19598.78s -> 19602.26s]  Like, they're not just gonna instantly know exactly what to do.
[19613.41s -> 19614.41s]  We win the guy.
[19614.41s -> 19617.21s]  Don't just stand here and watch me die, man.
[19618.21s -> 19619.81s]  Holy shit!
[19623.79s -> 19625.63s]  That is, oh my god.
[19625.63s -> 19628.47s]  If he had let me die there, I might have screamed.
[19629.35s -> 19631.99s]  Actually screamed out loud in anger.
[19635.31s -> 19637.27s]  Like, dude is watching me kite these people
[19637.27s -> 19638.75s]  within one inch of my life.
[19639.87s -> 19642.83s]  And instead of like helping or walking up and doing anything, you know what he does?
[19645.31s -> 19646.75s]  He pulls a fucking gross score.
[19650.69s -> 19651.81s]  My man just likes to watch.
[19652.53s -> 19654.85s]  It's on the wrong with it, but, you know, there's time in a place.
[19671.94s -> 19674.34s]  I don't actually want to buy pinks because I don't think we're strong enough that
[19675.70s -> 19678.98s]  I don't think that we're strong enough that I can actually even defend the pinks right now, if I'm being honest.
[19680.10s -> 19684.10s]  We should be strong enough, but we kind of throw a weed when I overforce the rift.
[19684.82s -> 19691.94s]  So I think... I think...
[19691.94s -> 19701.34s]  We need to push this wave so that we can get tempo and move around the map prior.
[19701.34s -> 19703.74s]  Sorry, I keep saying the wrong thing.
[19703.74s -> 19709.70s]  Uh-oh.
[19709.70s -> 19710.70s]  That guy's dead.
[19710.70s -> 19712.70s]  I-I have to ditch that guy.
[19712.70s -> 19713.70s]  Is that his fuck?
[19713.70s -> 19715.70s]  Oh, I'm dead, too, maybe.
[19715.70s -> 19717.70s]  Oh, I'm so dead.
[19717.70s -> 19719.70s]  Yeah, that was my bad.
[19719.70s -> 19721.70s]  That was my bad, my bad, my bad, my bad, my bad.
[19721.70s -> 19723.70s]  Like, we just got-we just got ran down.
[19723.70s -> 19724.70s]  That was on me.
[19724.70s -> 19730.04s]  Like, we had good positioning,
[19730.04s -> 19738.32s]  but the jungler wasn't close enough so this is my gun. I also didn't expect to get fucking
[19738.32s -> 19745.59s]  4 man's but I should have, right? We should play for this though. I wish I could
[19745.59s -> 19751.27s]  type, I wish I wasn't chat restricted for a year. Dude, I swear to God, I'm not even
[19751.27s -> 19757.47s]  being mean. Like Riot was like, they chat restricted me because I type so much macro that
[19757.47s -> 19767.59s]  it gets on people's nerves and they don't want to be spam typing. Loki, don't play for
[19767.59s -> 19795.21s]  I need help because if you guys can help we need the clear vision on Dragon a year
[19795.21s -> 19800.45s]  Yeah, I get on chat. It starts at April 15 or April 11th or some shit
[19801.45s -> 19803.45s]  2024
[19803.45s -> 19808.25s]  I've never seen it. It must have been like an actual riot or something
[19808.49s -> 19813.45s]  Like I've never seen an automated system give you a year chat restricts, right so in my mind
[19813.45s -> 19815.45s]  It's got to be like an actual like
[19815.45s -> 19823.12s]  like a rioter was like dronimo we know you're good enough to climb but stop typing
[19823.12s -> 19834.39s]  you know what I mean that's like what must have been going on and I'm like okay well
[19834.39s -> 19855.70s]  sure I mean I didn't know you could get chat band a year what's weird is like I
[19855.70s -> 19858.74s]  said I don't like say trigger words it's not like I tell people that like end
[19858.74s -> 19863.98s]  themselves and stuff it's mainly just me typing like go here do that do this like
[19863.98s -> 19869.02s]  I type a lot, right, which is obviously like if you type a lot it can be toxic as well. So
[19873.04s -> 19874.72s]  Like typing lots annoying so I get it
[19886.35s -> 19889.47s]  We should be playing for barren side vision right now not
[19890.75s -> 19893.39s]  The vision we're playing with right now is bad. We should be playing over here
[19895.31s -> 19899.15s]  Like I want to play for barren vision, but it's a little hard to do that right now
[19904.54s -> 19907.90s]  Cuz you see how Tom can't you meet or like transferring vision control around the map right now
[19907.90s -> 19914.34s]  They're playing this little support game of like hide the vision. Look at this fuck
[19915.34s -> 19918.78s]  Look at this motherfucker
[19931.20s -> 19959.39s]  Oh, he's so dumb. I still think he's dumb. How do I just take it tonight? I
[19960.67s -> 19966.46s]  Took my entire HP bar on a global my bad dude
[19966.46s -> 19968.46s]  I really wish the mouth fight would group though
[19969.66s -> 19973.26s]  I get that he's like doing the thing where he's like, oh, let's you know split
[19973.26s -> 19975.98s]  I like his play was actually really smart there
[19976.62s -> 19980.58s]  The mouth fights play I'm in like that wasn't his fault that we got shit on at all
[19980.58s -> 19985.46s]  I just wish that he would group because if he groups up and hits our we win every team fight
[19986.26s -> 19991.26s]  Because right now our only frontliner is the Woocon right and the fact that Woocon's our frontliner
[19991.26s -> 19993.26s]  We don't have the ability to play the game
[19993.26s -> 19997.26s]  What did I get stuck on that? What the fuck was that?
[19997.26s -> 20003.26s]  Like that Tom Kinch getting to eat forward like that, blindly into our entire team.
[20003.26s -> 20007.26s]  And then not getting punished for it, might be the most like solo queue thing I've ever seen.
[20007.26s -> 20015.26s]  Nobody wanted to hit him because he was the tank, but yeah, that's, we should still kill him, you know?
[20015.26s -> 20025.03s]  We can fight this guy. Oh my god, jungle hard, just come.
[20025.03s -> 20028.27s]  Oh, we're forfitting. Oh, okay. That makes perfect sense, right?
[20030.27s -> 20038.95s]  Just come group. Bro, can and come group. Please guys, like I don't know why everybody's frustrated. We're literally still up in gold.
[20039.67s -> 20044.15s]  Please come group up. We just took it in Hibbiter. Just just come group.
[20045.83s -> 20048.79s]  Help me get vision on this dragon so that I don't so we don't die.
[20049.51s -> 20052.79s]  Like I need my team to actually walk over here to help me get vision.
[20052.79s -> 20058.94s]  It's really frustrating because I need the front liners that we'll call in the mouthed,
[20058.94s -> 20063.90s]  to walk in with me because I'm a little thuckin, why I have a big gun but I'm a big
[20063.90s -> 20068.94s]  gun girl, right? So I need these two guys to walk in with me these two big burly mountain men
[20074.58s -> 20084.42s]  so that I can play the game, you know? No, we don't push bot. No, no, no, no. My mouthed's pushing
[20084.42s -> 20089.62s]  the wave that we already have down. I wish I could macro. I wish I could type some macro
[20089.62s -> 20099.43s]  right now. There are my team is so lost. There's so beyond lost right now. It's crazy.
[20099.43s -> 20111.42s]  There's lost this shit. Just dude, dude Dragon, yes. Just do this. Just do it. I'll start
[20111.42s -> 20115.42s]  it for you. Here you go. I don't know why we're standing in a bush waiting for them to face
[20115.42s -> 20125.22s]  check. Dude Dragon, yes. I swear to God, you have to do everything in the Z-Lo, where you have
[20125.22s -> 20131.70s]  to start every fight. I have to basically I have to start every fight. Right? I have to not only start every fight,
[20131.70s -> 20136.42s]  but I have to like ping my team. What to do exactly? Because everybody plays so safe in this
[20136.42s -> 20149.03s]  elo. Why did my mouth fight just stop his back? Why are you all fighting? Oh my god, please guys.
[20152.95s -> 20159.59s]  It's fine. It's not a fun. No mouth fight. You can't one be nine that. Just back off. They didn't get anything.
[20159.59s -> 20165.59s]  They didn't get anything we got dragon. We're on dragon soul points. I'm losing hairs.
[20166.39s -> 20171.19s]  I'm losing fucking hairs man. I ain't got many hairs to spare anymore. We're out here losing hair.
[20177.34s -> 20180.54s]  I said I'm babysitting like this. It's got to be what a preschool teacher feels like you know
[20181.50s -> 20185.90s]  like a low key like preschool teacher just feels like this. This has to be it.
[20191.42s -> 20196.94s]  Like watch it. It's like watching a toddler like you watch them from the corner right and they're like eating glue and you're like
[20196.94s -> 20202.18s]  I mean that's mad and then you tell them like don't eat glue, don't eat glue to me and he's like okay
[20202.18s -> 20206.22s]  And then like you leave him there for five minutes to go like do something to watch somebody else
[20206.22s -> 20208.86s]  Then all of a sudden Timmy's seen glue again and you're like bro
[20209.90s -> 20223.19s]  Bro we just had this discussion and it's like not Timmy's fault right because he's a toddler
[20224.39s -> 20229.43s]  So you can't be mad at Timmy because he's a toddler you can't but it's like it's frustrating
[20229.43s -> 20244.30s]  It's like goddamn it man like what is what is happening like mouth-eye just group
[20244.60s -> 20255.38s]  My mouthhead has a fetish with just pushing bot. Bro, just group in hit R. Bro, I know you have Bork. Wait, you have Bork?
[20256.00s -> 20263.38s]  What, bro? We need to be able to engage. We don't win through split.
[20264.42s -> 20266.42s]  Just group up hit R and we win.
[20267.42s -> 20275.66s]  Like I've been controlling the ever-loving fuck out of all the vision this game. I feel like I'm doing all of this to control vision and shit and it still feels like it's not enough
[20275.66s -> 20292.87s]  It's kind of nuts. Okay, it still feels not enough. No, don't go back. Don't go back. Don't go back. Please don't go back
[20294.55s -> 20316.26s]  Did me they don't have a word. They don't know I'm there. Well, we're just not going to old-decker what's
[20316.86s -> 20325.10s]  This is why you we listen oh
[20325.90s -> 20332.38s]  My god, I have I actually just I'm so I don't know what to say like I literally pined to come
[20332.38s -> 20339.06s]  Wukong didn't use ulti. Twitch just died in it and now he's at fk. Oh my god. Oh my god kill me in game
[20339.54s -> 20341.94s]  Kenan and Malfi. Can you guys do anything like

[20403.35s -> 20408.84s]  But we do not need the mouth fight. I
[20410.16s -> 20418.70s]  Am a higher level than my jungler push men guys you got to push men first
[20419.54s -> 20421.54s]  Listen homies you got to push men first
[20422.42s -> 20428.41s]  You know what fuck it don't even go in yeah, fuck it push men
[20429.17s -> 20433.45s]  We're just gonna end the game if they go for dragon here we just we just push fuck it
[20438.53s -> 20441.25s]  That's actually such a good macro call not even joking
[20441.89s -> 20455.76s]  Such a good macro call actually
[20461.34s -> 20463.34s]  Everybody just run though just run
[20464.06s -> 20468.98s]  Don't don't oldie in no guys we don't fight this whole I have cancer
[20469.98s -> 20471.98s]  We're getting flanks boys
[20472.38s -> 20475.82s]  Dude I have such high levels of cancer right now. You have no idea
[20476.82s -> 20479.32s]  Like I I fucking functioning cancer
[20512.76s -> 20520.01s]  You guys just killed the fucking Gregus. Oh my god. Thank God. Thank God. Just end the game
[20520.01s -> 20523.45s]  Please end the game. Please hit the fucking thick.
[20523.45s -> 20531.73s]  Oh my god. Walter White is like my hero right now. I don't even understand.
[20531.73s -> 20537.81s]  Like I feel like I feel like what Walter White felt like dealing with Skylar for literally
[20537.81s -> 20543.93s]  three years. Like this is outrageous. This is what this feels like. Like I can relate to
[20543.93s -> 20580.06s]  of the show so much more. Oh my god. Like dude. Oh crap. They're the look it. Look it. Look
[20580.06s -> 20592.12s]  it like. Look it like what's going on in the game. Like I don't even mean to be mean about this.
[20592.12s -> 20610.33s]  It's just this is crazy. Malfight though popping off. Malfight popping off. Like what do you
[20610.33s -> 20619.92s]  I mean, I feel like I'm confused now.
[20619.92s -> 20621.92s]  I'm not even blaming the Wukong anymore.
[20621.92s -> 20623.92s]  I don't know why this guy is in the game.
[20623.92s -> 20626.92s]  Oh, he hasn't played to that S.M.M.R.
[20626.92s -> 20629.92s]  Oh, he just has previous season inflated M.M.R.
[20629.92s -> 20635.41s]  That's what this is.
[20635.41s -> 20638.41s]  Because he was GM for three years.
[20638.41s -> 20641.41s]  So, his M.M.R says that he belongs here even though he doesn't play.
[20641.41s -> 20644.41s]  I bet you last season he only played 50 games.
[20644.41s -> 20646.41s]  I can look, right?
[20646.41s -> 20647.41s]  We're going to see.
[20647.41s -> 20652.86s]  50 games. I can work, right? We're going to see, like, I'm going to
[20652.86s -> 20656.90s]  games he played. Yeah, he played. He played like 50 games last season. So
[20656.90s -> 20659.62s]  I can say my Martin really changed. He just got masters and then stopped.
[20661.14s -> 20672.00s]  Which is fine. There's only one with that's I just wish he would chill, you
[20672.00s -> 20679.79s]  know, like, uh, not rage quit halfway through the game. Because I
[20679.79s -> 20682.95s]  said, people's elo and shit used to bother me a lot. I don't, I don't
[20682.95s -> 20685.75s]  get bothered by any more, because I realized that was cringe. I don't
[20685.75s -> 20688.31s]  care about their elo and shit. What I care about is, like, I just want
[20688.31s -> 20692.31s]  them to play the game. You know what I mean? Like I just want them to not rage, not not like
[20692.31s -> 20696.39s]  the absolute apes in the game and just play. That's all I ask for. I don't care if you're
[20696.39s -> 20698.95s]  a time-of-player plot-player on the game and you're just like accidentally in the game.
[20698.95s -> 20701.51s]  I guess not your fault. I just want you to push buttons.
[20701.51s -> 20713.54s]  What I'm doing wrong to have a 36% win rate? I can't see the link because you don't have to
[20713.54s -> 20719.35s]  give me your name and your server. How are you guys doing, by the way? Everybody have
[20719.35s -> 20725.19s]  a good day. You guys enjoy on the stream, having a good time. Watching me go bald in live,
[20725.19s -> 20727.19s]  like, live time. You guys are like, oh, what,
[20727.19s -> 20728.99s]  dronom was going bald live on stream.
[20728.99s -> 20732.19s]  And I'm like, yeah, it's rough.
[20732.19s -> 20734.19s]  Hold on, I'm going to take my pants off.
[20771.36s -> 20777.31s]  Dude, what, I, I, fuck you guys.
[20777.31s -> 20779.31s]  They fucking, like, I get double swap.
[20779.31s -> 20780.31s]  Did you get see that shit?
[20780.31s -> 20782.31s]  They're like, oh, yeah, the support could do it.
[20782.31s -> 20784.31s]  And then he banned Santa.
[20784.31s -> 20785.31s]  I mean, I didn't hover it.
[20785.31s -> 20787.31s]  That's my bad.
[20787.31s -> 20788.31s]  God dammit.
[20788.31s -> 20789.31s]  I should have hovered.
[20789.31s -> 20791.31s]  I was just like taking my pants off.
[20791.31s -> 20804.03s]  And now he wants first pick dude. What oh my god, I hate I don't I don't know I don't know what to say. This is crazy
[20804.51s -> 20810.77s]  Today's Thursday right
[20811.57s -> 20824.10s]  I might losing days today's Thursday right guys. It is okay cool
[20825.92s -> 20828.56s]  What do I play there Xareth and the Zinn
[20830.12s -> 20842.09s]  Ebsaya I'm gonna say it's probably recon something though. Let's see what their bobbin is though
[20842.09s -> 20844.85s]  I actually have to see what their bobbin is to choose my runes
[20848.74s -> 20880.77s]  So now, oh, they have an Ezreal. The fuck is their team comp? Okay. When you do this build,
[20880.77s -> 20889.01s]  what's the secondaries supposed to be? I think it's supposed to be this. Or maybe like revitalize?
[20890.29s -> 20896.10s]  I just felt like unflinching so good. Oh, they have a support,
[20897.30s -> 20903.70s]  zeroth, so supports, yeah, okay. So I want, uh, I definitely want Glacial here, and I want,
[20903.70s -> 20909.86s]  Maybe I take MR actually instead of armor because they have two poke champs and
[20910.86s -> 20920.28s]  I take this. Yeah, yeah, this is good. Okay, that's not bad. Okay, once I'll be ready. I need to get some more water
[20982.85s -> 20983.85s]  Burn
[20987.85s -> 20989.85s]  Oh shit, no, don't flag me
[20991.19s -> 20993.19s]  Fuck, I had a pee
[20993.79s -> 20995.79s]  Fucking flagged me for AFK because I didn't take a leak.
[20998.08s -> 21002.16s]  Can you not start with ADK or the move over to support? I always fall asleep before the ADK game play
[21003.20s -> 21005.92s]  Wait, what? I fell asleep before ADK
[21006.72s -> 21008.72s]  What do you mean?
[21008.72s -> 21011.36s]  Oh, you mean like start with my main and then play
[21013.76s -> 21015.76s]  Yeah, I played ADK at the start
[21017.20s -> 21027.87s]  I should probably
[21029.47s -> 21031.87s]  play ADK anymore over support
[21034.03s -> 21037.15s]  Later in the stream, they're all point 80 carry game after this.
[21038.19s -> 21059.68s]  I feel bad. Oh, it's Gregus. I thought it was going to be Zara, but it's Gregus.
[21063.89s -> 21068.37s]  I don't want to fight too hard level 1 even though that I should have gone in there. It does my bad.
[21069.17s -> 21072.69s]  I want to I want to try and get level 2 here even though I think we actually win level 1.
[21075.90s -> 21079.42s]  Oh, I got his phone pointing. Yeah, I should have fought level 1. That was my bad.
[21080.70s -> 21083.02s]  Because we win very hard level 1. I just griefed it.
[21083.02s -> 21085.02s]  but
[21085.02s -> 21090.02s]  like all I have to do there is going on the Ezreal or the Gregus of one and they can't play the game
[21090.02s -> 21091.02s]  right?
[21091.02s -> 21108.06s]  how do you like it?
[21108.06s -> 21110.06s]  it's not worth it's not worth it
[21110.06s -> 21114.06s]  there's no way that I can not get Eid by Gregus there by the way
[21114.06s -> 21118.37s]  like I don't know if I can flash W there
[21118.37s -> 21131.52s]  maybe we shouldn't be E-going buddy
[21131.52s -> 21153.29s]  guys just fucking E-gos in front of me like what?
[21153.29s -> 21155.29s]  Okay, I might have missed everything there, but like,
[21157.37s -> 21173.32s]  You know, that's okay. It's a little counterproductive
[21175.32s -> 21177.96s]  When I take a tower shot to land a queue
[21179.48s -> 21181.48s]  It feels a little counterproductive
[21188.95s -> 21199.16s]  But hey, I'm gonna back here just in case the enemy is in tries to get in command
[21201.91s -> 21210.09s]  Dude, I'm so sad I can't get boots. I'm gonna wait
[21210.09s -> 21217.15s]  Yeah, I'm gonna be cringe. I'm gonna wait. I would never wait here normally, but you know what? It's just it's so like it's such a big buy
[21219.03s -> 21221.03s]  I don't want to I'm I'm
[21221.53s -> 21227.43s]  Now that now that I've waited and beat cringe now I have to sit here and wait. Oh, it's so painful. Okay, I'm gonna wait
[21228.49s -> 21247.61s]  I'm sorry, I guess
[21247.61s -> 21254.02s]  Worked the way. No, not at all. I got lucky, but
[21254.94s -> 21269.83s]  You know what's interesting? I never used the stupid dematerializer
[21269.83s -> 21274.59s]  I think I should have like I should use it on every cannon or some shit, but I just don't do it
[21275.15s -> 21278.15s]  Because I know the reason you're supposed to use it is because it helps you push
[21278.79s -> 21281.63s]  Because you can demonetize the cannon right and just instant yeah
[21282.47s -> 21285.15s]  So you're supposed to use it because it's like a really fast way to push but it's also
[21286.51s -> 21305.10s]  I should not have w. Fuck I
[21305.10s -> 21307.10s]  Won't not the gragas anyway. I
[21307.50s -> 21310.06s]  Fucked up. I shouldn't have done read the gragas. I should have put it soar
[21312.75s -> 21314.75s]  This guy is gonna die
[21314.75s -> 21320.75s]  I will make it, oh, he's gonna die, put himself against the wall, did you?
[21320.75s -> 21327.98s]  That was my fault though, 100%
[21327.98s -> 21330.98s]  Cause if I didn't W in, they can't kill us, right?
[21330.98s -> 21332.98s]  And Greg is probably dies to the auto attack anyway.
[21332.98s -> 21336.98s]  My thought process was Greg is snared, so if I W here,
[21336.98s -> 21340.98s]  but even if I don't get E'd, I'm pretty confident I die.
[21340.98s -> 21379.41s]  Am I that I tried, I was out of everything.
[21379.41s -> 21388.16s]  I wonder if I could have played that better.
[21388.16s -> 21391.56s]  Maybe like if I could have weaved an extra auto in or something?
[21391.56s -> 21393.16s]  I don't know.
[21393.16s -> 21395.66s]  It's hard to know.
[21395.66s -> 21414.26s]  Alright, I'm gonna go mid here.
[21414.26s -> 21416.26s]  I can't.
[21416.26s -> 21419.14s]  Okay.
[21419.14s -> 21420.14s]  Like who'd go mid?
[21420.14s -> 21424.78s]  But I think I, I think I want to sit bought for a bit and get some XP.
[21424.78s -> 21426.78s]  I think it's smarter to do that at this point.
[21426.78s -> 21431.05s]  I think we should push this.
[21431.05s -> 21450.34s]  I don't want to W in because I know Zen's area.
[21450.34s -> 21454.34s]  That's why I didn't want to W because I know Zen's area.
[21454.34s -> 21471.25s]  They were just making it so obvious, right? Like that it was like
[21472.69s -> 21476.93s]  Sometimes when people make shit too good to be true. It is too good to be true
[21478.53s -> 21481.33s]  Like oh shit, we're just gonna they're just gonna fight us here cool
[21483.17s -> 21489.86s]  Oh, yeah, I gotta help him push my bed. I'm playing sloppy
[21515.52s -> 21523.57s]  You just wanna see a cool trick watch us she could push the wave and then just min max the back
[21523.57s -> 21524.57s]  back.
[21524.57s -> 21530.78s]  How cool was that?
[21530.78s -> 21533.54s]  She just pushes the wave and I just back next to the bush and she's just like, oh, I
[21533.54s -> 21548.19s]  guess I'll take the free ride.
[21548.19s -> 21562.78s]  I really need level six, badly.
[21562.78s -> 21565.74s]  Like, bro, I really cannot get level six right now.
[21565.74s -> 21568.18s]  This is painful.
[21568.18s -> 21574.31s]  Okay, kill these.
[21574.31s -> 21575.31s]  Maybe I'm six off this.
[21575.31s -> 21577.31s]  Nope, guess not.
[21577.31s -> 21581.91s]  I was going to stay mid there by the way, and help the homie.
[21581.91s -> 21612.93s]  I need to go mid.
[21612.93s -> 21628.21s]  This is so awkward.
[21628.21s -> 21636.02s]  Bro, help me.
[21636.02s -> 21638.46s]  Bro, like, you gotta walk to me.
[21638.46s -> 21641.94s]  Like, I can't, like, my Eve is like here.
[21641.94s -> 21644.78s]  I'm way over here.
[21644.78s -> 21645.62s]  Right?
[21645.62s -> 21649.99s]  And my Eve's like yo, homie.
[21649.99s -> 21653.11s]  Like dude, we're trying to push the way even for her.
[21653.11s -> 21659.59s]  And she's just not accepting to wait.
[21659.59s -> 21660.99s]  And I can't double you the wall.
[21660.99s -> 21662.95s]  I mean, I guess I could double you the wall.
[21662.95s -> 21664.43s]  Cause I was trying to walk around, right?
[21664.43s -> 21666.11s]  I saw her in trouble when I was here.
[21666.11s -> 21669.91s]  So I wanted to walk towards here so I could e over the wall.
[21669.91s -> 21671.09s]  That was my thought process.
[21671.09s -> 21673.07s]  E over the wall helped the guy.
[21673.07s -> 21682.17s]  But he didn't understand that and I just got shit on it and it felt really bad.
[21682.17s -> 21686.71s]  Both our soloes are getting absolutely shit on.
[21686.71s -> 21695.34s]  This is very bad because I don't know how to help our team at this stage.
[21695.34s -> 21699.06s]  Like I'm just always behind on tempo now around the map in the wrong spot at the wrong
[21699.06s -> 21700.06s]  time.
[21700.06s -> 21726.26s]  This is so awkward.
[21726.26s -> 21733.00s]  I have a whole week of kill this guy, guess what?
[21736.34s -> 21755.93s]  We could maybe kill his in if I sneak in here?
[21755.93s -> 21757.45s]  Push the way, push the way, hurry.
[21758.79s -> 21776.96s]  He's got a crash at, I mean, this guy's just dead.
[21781.16s -> 21783.16s]  My 80 carry is gonna get fucked for it though,
[21783.16s -> 21793.78s]  so I hope it was worth, like my 80 carry is gonna get zones.
[21793.78s -> 21796.66s]  It's really hard to tell if anything like that's worth sometimes,
[21796.66s -> 21800.46s]  because I used my ult before a dragon fight,
[21800.46s -> 21806.34s]  We're gonna lose bot tower. There's just so many factors, right? It's so far. And now I don't have words. Oh, it's so rough
[21807.22s -> 21831.22s]  Oh, I got the ignite off, but dude. I can't put that Gregus lived. No. Oh, I had stopwatch
[21831.22s -> 21839.82s]  I have stopwatch. Oh my god, I'm the worst player in existence. I actually have the ability to live there. Oh
[21840.82s -> 21847.89s]  No, I should sell my magicizing shame. I
[21847.89s -> 21851.09s]  I actually just want the item. So
[21852.69s -> 21854.69s]  Dude, I'm so bad
[21855.41s -> 21859.65s]  Dude, Greg is this low key at good pick versus Rekond though. You can stop his engage so easily
[21868.56s -> 21870.56s]  It's actually low key at good pick
[21896.45s -> 21922.03s]  Bro
[21922.03s -> 21935.57s]  Nice not bad. I kind of want to back off here
[21936.13s -> 21941.70s]  You don't feel it's kind of bad. He has noticed that I just I got my
[21941.70s -> 21952.35s]  I don't know if you guys noticed this, but I got my fucking, I got like four assists just now, but it was after I
[21953.15s -> 21956.83s]  sold my mages. How fucking bad does that feel?
[21958.11s -> 21966.50s]  Like, actually. Oh, by the way, uh, I wanted to ask you guys
[21968.66s -> 21970.98s]  What 80 carry do you guys think is the most
[21970.98s -> 21976.99s]  I saw out for people to learn right now.
[21976.99s -> 21979.39s]  Like, what would you say is like people want to learn
[21979.39s -> 21982.59s]  this AD carry over other AD carries?
[21982.59s -> 21984.79s]  What do you guys think in?
[21984.79s -> 21986.99s]  My man says Timo, okay.
[21986.99s -> 21988.99s]  Make sense?
[21988.99s -> 21997.78s]  Got it?
[21997.78s -> 21998.78s]  Depends?
[21998.78s -> 22004.18s]  Yeah, I'm just trying to wonder what people would want to watch
[22004.18s -> 22006.78s]  or what people would want to learn specifically.
[22006.78s -> 22008.18s]  So I know everybody plays different shit,
[22008.18s -> 22024.42s]  I know this is also like popular shit, you know. Okay. I'm just bad. He's bad too. We listen. We're bad. We're bad guys
[22069.03s -> 22072.25s]  Oh, not bad.
[22072.25s -> 22078.01s]  Genolutions I affiliates damn is it like just that different like a lot of people like different stuff
[22080.12s -> 22092.38s]  because I've always just thought like oh no I guess I've always just thought that people like
[22092.38s -> 22100.13s]  like, um, a lot of people really like like meta 80 carriers or like really playmaking 80 carriers, right?
[22100.13s -> 22107.33s]  Like, jinks is probably the best 80 carry in the meta, but I don't say a lot of people ever ask her like request to watch jinks.
[22107.33s -> 22112.33s]  You know what I mean, like jinks is not like, she's not like a fun 80 carrier that people want to learn how to play.
[22112.33s -> 22117.33s]  Even though she is like the best 80, there's like the people who are like, oh yeah, don't jinks is boring.
[22117.33s -> 22120.33s]  I got want to play jinn and like shoot people. I want to play like Lucian and Dashran.
[22120.33s -> 22124.57s]  So that's what I'm wondering is like what the number one 80 carries for people just like enjoy watching
[22139.94s -> 22148.74s]  Not bad though. Okay, I think we could play an 80 carry game. I'm down. I know you guys in 80 carry game
[22149.54s -> 22154.18s]  I owe you that much for watching me play support for two hours actually I think it was like two and a half hours
[22157.19s -> 22159.19s]  Yeah, we put four games to support so it's like two hours
[22160.79s -> 22162.79s]  Yeah, oh you guys for for that
[22162.79s -> 22171.82s]  that Ziya Irvine. Ziya is fun to watch.
[22171.82s -> 22173.18s]  I do like Ziya.
[22173.18s -> 22174.06s]  You'll love Jinks and Kate.
[22174.06s -> 22181.87s]  Oh, there you go.
[22181.87s -> 22182.67s]  You're playing supports,
[22182.67s -> 22184.27s]  I've seen you like to watch how you carry this plant.
[22184.27s -> 22185.59s]  Ah.
[22186.75s -> 22188.67s]  So that you can like better help the homies.
[22188.67s -> 22202.34s]  Got it, got it.
[22202.34s -> 22203.78s]  We need eight wins, I think.
[22203.78s -> 22205.10s]  From this point, we are right now.
[22205.10s -> 22208.62s]  I think it's eight wins to get to Grandmaster.
[22208.62s -> 22209.50s]  I think.
[22209.50s -> 22213.62s]  Oops.
[22213.62s -> 22214.26s]  Because we're what?
[22214.26s -> 22216.38s]  370 something, right?
[22216.38s -> 22219.50s]  Like 360.
[22219.50s -> 22222.74s]  No, we just won, we're not 360, we're like 370.
[22224.34s -> 22226.94s]  We're 387, okay, so it's not updated,
[22226.94s -> 22228.62s]  but what is this?
[22228.62s -> 22232.59s]  Stop.
[22232.59s -> 22233.55s]  So we need what?
[22233.55s -> 22236.87s]  Seven wins, net wins to get to GM.
[22237.83s -> 22239.39s]  I think we can hit GM.
[22239.39s -> 22241.71s]  I'm a little less confident right now
[22241.71s -> 22243.75s]  about master or about challenger,
[22243.75s -> 22245.43s]  but I think we can definitely hit GM.
[22246.55s -> 22249.39s]  Like I think I'll get stuck in GM for a bit,
[22249.39s -> 22254.84s]  unless, unless,
[22255.00s -> 22264.70s]  The games get higher quality. I'll be stuck in jam for a little bit.
[22264.70s -> 22270.70s]  Because the thing about the games so far is like the higher quality the games get.
[22270.70s -> 22274.70s]  The easier it actually is to carry if like if you're a decent player.
[22274.70s -> 22279.70s]  Because the better your teammates get, which means that like if you're at that like say like a
[22279.70s -> 22282.70s]  Challenger player will have a better time a Challenger 80 character player carrying in
[22282.70s -> 22286.70s]  Challenger if they get a lead then in diamond if they get a lead.
[22286.70s -> 22290.30s]  if that, like, I don't that sounds weird to say,
[22290.30s -> 22292.42s]  but it's basically just because like,
[22292.42s -> 22294.26s]  when your teammates are better, they enable you better
[22294.26s -> 22296.86s]  and 80 carry in all those other roles,
[22296.86s -> 22297.82s]  when they're being enabled,
[22297.82s -> 22305.48s]  it's a lot easier to play the game.
[22305.48s -> 22309.12s]  Like if I were to first pick Jinks in Challenger MMR,
[22309.12s -> 22311.36s]  there's a good chance my teammates would pick stuff
[22311.36s -> 22313.96s]  that like let's me play Jinks, right?
[22313.96s -> 22314.80s]  Not saying it would happen,
[22314.80s -> 22316.80s]  but there's like a chance that my teammates would pick something
[22316.80s -> 22319.16s]  that like, they would pick like tanks
[22319.16s -> 22320.96s]  or front liners or some shit, right?
[22320.96s -> 22322.16s]  Or like Lulu.
[22322.16s -> 22325.16s]  Whereas if you're picking jinx first pick and like,
[22325.16s -> 22327.28s]  let's say you guys are gold average.
[22327.28s -> 22328.96s]  Well, your support might just literally pick like
[22328.96s -> 22330.64s]  first time Velcons or some shit and you're like,
[22330.64s -> 22343.93s]  well, this sucks.
[22343.93s -> 22347.05s]  Dude, I swear every time I hear the end of this song,
[22347.05s -> 22349.17s]  does anybody know who forest within is?
[22350.45s -> 22353.93s]  I swear the guy talking at the end of this song
[22353.93s -> 22355.81s]  sounds exactly like forest within.
[22357.21s -> 22366.95s]  No joke, listen to this, listen to this.
[22366.95s -> 22369.31s]  That guy who was like saying it was DJ,
[22369.31s -> 22375.99s]  Like that guy sounded exactly like I don't know why my brain does that when we sound of the exactly like forced within I swear to God
[22376.27s -> 22381.31s]  It's actually like perfectly like if you told me that was him. I would immediately believe you
[22381.71s -> 22392.19s]  This guy wants to join the discord. Oh, I'm I'm nervous about this shit
[22392.57s -> 22404.20s]  It is my support though. So like maybe we could join the discord and like work together a bit
[22404.64s -> 22412.85s]  But I'm also nervous about joining discord calls of people
[22412.85s -> 22424.60s]  Well, on stream, who I don't know, I don't know if it's worth.
[22424.60s -> 22426.36s]  Where would you put Ezreal on the tier list?
[22426.36s -> 22428.28s]  I think Ezreal's A tier.
[22428.28s -> 22431.60s]  I think he could be S tier for solo queue, but he's hard.
[22431.60s -> 22432.60s]  He's really hard.
[22432.60s -> 22434.00s]  Ezreal's one of the hardest cities.
[22434.00s -> 22437.16s]  So I would say he's like A tier right now.
[22437.16s -> 22441.52s]  If you're really good at S, he is very, very, very strong.
[22442.56s -> 22444.64s]  But he's also incredibly hard to play.
[22444.64s -> 22448.48s]  But he also is not weak in the meta.
[22448.48s -> 22455.48s]  So I give him like a strong A, like above other A's.
[22455.48s -> 22460.44s]  She focused on made supports like brand Xareth or engage, like puts not to us.
[22460.44s -> 22463.44s]  It depends on your ego and depends on what you're doing.
[22463.44s -> 22474.08s]  I think engage supports and lower you low are bad, no, somebody dodged.
[22474.08s -> 22479.20s]  I think engage supports and lower you low are bad personally because I think that
[22479.20s -> 22490.83s]  You can be a really good engage player and it doesn't matter if your team just gets caught over and over again, or if you like make it engage your team misplayers, right?
[22490.83s -> 22502.83s]  So it's like if you want to play engage supports do it because they are better than other engage opponents are better than mages, but I think in solo queue mages are better to solo carry.
[22502.83s -> 22507.07s]  So it just depends. It depends on your EO and it depends on like what you're trying to accomplish right?
[22507.63s -> 22515.95s]  Because a lot of the time is a support player. It's why I play Senna right like I play Senna because I like being able to carry games as support
[22516.39s -> 22518.39s]  That's why I like Senna
[22518.95s -> 22520.95s]  Whereas like if you're a
[22522.03s -> 22527.19s]  Like if I like I can play almost every support right I can play not on this I can play boy I could play these sports
[22527.19s -> 22534.87s]  But the problem is is like I feel bad if like I get like it feels really shitty to get people ahead and then have them completely through their reads over and over again
[22534.87s -> 22537.43s]  And then tell them rage and shit, so it feels like dog shit
[22537.83s -> 22544.47s]  So it's nice. It's just like give myself the opportunity to carry it rather than rely 100% on other people, you know
[22544.95s -> 22548.90s]  But I would say the number one thing is
[22550.22s -> 22556.34s]  Play what you think is fun. That's just the number one rule like playing if you want to win you can play meta
[22556.34s -> 22567.34s]  But the problem is, if like you're shoving your face and I'll try to learn a meta champ that you just don't enjoy the place that I love, you're never gonna actually be good at the champion because you're like, it's like you're working, right?
[22567.34s -> 22571.34s]  But the best way to learn the champions and learn how to play the game is to have fun.
[22571.34s -> 22576.34s]  Because if you're not having fun at some point, you're not gonna be able to learn how to play.
[22576.34s -> 22581.34s]  Because you're not gonna be able to put in the hours or put in the games and be focused during the game, you're gonna be frustrated.
[22581.34s -> 22583.34s]  And if you're frustrated, you're not gonna be learning.
[22583.34s -> 22590.72s]  So I always say just place something that's fun. The fun aspect is got to be way more important
[22596.18s -> 22611.12s]  We're gonna music go. Fuck. I'm surprised. Can you guys even hear the music half the time?
[22611.60s -> 22614.08s]  I have it on so low that I'm not even sure you guys can hear it.
[22615.28s -> 22642.40s]  It's just like barely background noise. Is this guy holding swap hostage?
[22644.32s -> 22668.26s]  Join call and I'll swap. Do these holding swap hostage? By the way, if you guys do like the stream
[22668.26s -> 22674.92s]  Don't forget the follow. You can scroll down to see all my socials, too. I like TikTok Instagram all that crap
[22675.54s -> 22687.48s]  It's all about the stream. There's like links and shit and you know
[22689.12s -> 22705.44s]  Man's got to eat you can you put your prime to if you want you know feeling it. I'm gonna do a Kaiser game
[22705.84s -> 22709.54s]  He went box
[22709.86s -> 22712.66s]  But I kind of want to play Kaiser
[22716.03s -> 22718.83s]  What was the voice this is what happens when I get close to the mic?
[22718.83s -> 22725.83s]  I should put the mic in front of my face more, the mic's like over to the corner.
[22725.83s -> 22749.92s]  So the mic is like really badly-directioned.
[22749.92s -> 22751.92s]  Ahhhh.
[22751.92s -> 22753.92s]  This is a cut-down game.
[22753.92s -> 22757.19s]  There's...
[22757.19s -> 22761.19s]  Greg has always used AP. He doesn't go tank. He goes like AP.
[22761.19s -> 22763.19s]  I kind of want to go last stand.
[22763.19s -> 22780.10s]  That's fun.
[22780.10s -> 22781.10s]  I should've taken Ghost.
[22781.10s -> 22783.10s]  Ghost don't run so good this game.
[22783.10s -> 22789.61s]  You try to keep it shield though?
[22789.61s -> 22790.61s]  It's strong?
[22790.61s -> 22791.61s]  Yeah, it's fun, huh?
[22791.61s -> 22798.46s]  I love K with shield both so fun this sort of is such a good ghost game
[22799.68s -> 22801.68s]  frustrated. Oh, I
[22802.92s -> 22817.16s]  Like wasn't paying attention. I always wonder if I should go
[22818.04s -> 22820.04s]  Part of me always wants to go like
[22821.44s -> 22825.56s]  Long sort of three against Thresh and Zaya but with Kaisa
[22825.88s -> 22828.52s]  I feel like you're on really specific timers with Kaisa
[22828.76s -> 22832.00s]  So you have to go like it's really important to go
[22832.00s -> 22840.34s]  So, Doran, so that you can get the Q upgrade timer on the right timing, I've been getting
[22840.34s -> 22843.54s]  the Q upgrade timer so big.
[22843.54s -> 22850.54s]  Also this game, I feel like I go work this game, second, Borker Witzens.
[22850.54s -> 22854.78s]  If Grigas is not ultra fed, I'll probably go Bork because I don't want to get Witzens just
[22854.78s -> 22855.78s]  for Grigas.
[22855.78s -> 22883.54s]  Okay, you started Q, oh, Diana's starting on Wolves, okay.
[22883.54s -> 22885.54s]  I need to get some coffee after this game, I'm gonna...
[22885.54s -> 22886.54s]  ...draisey.
[22886.54s -> 22908.52s]  I should've done the middle minion thing, I'm so bad.
[22909.52s -> 22917.16s]  I should've literally just done the thing with the minion.
[22917.16s -> 22920.16s]  So when you know if the rest starts hook, you can still play up, right?
[22920.16s -> 22940.79s]  I can play up, I can play aggressive, I'm bad.
[22941.79s -> 22944.79s]  I should've just killed the Thresh.
[22944.79s -> 22947.79s]  This is really bad man, we can't help, we can't help.
[22947.79s -> 22953.74s]  Because the way the wave is going, I'm so bad, I fucked up.
[22953.74s -> 22960.29s]  It should be fine, but I still like it where it it foxes over early game
[22962.42s -> 22964.42s]  Cuz they fucked up very badly
[22965.92s -> 22969.60s]  Like I can't stress enough how badly they just fucked up, but it didn't matter
[22971.16s -> 22974.16s]  Okay, that's that's happening apparently
[22975.48s -> 22979.64s]  Don't worry guys. I'm a vizzioplayer or kisoplayer on the server. It's me
[22979.64s -> 22991.00s]  I'm just literally playing white dog shits.
[22991.00s -> 23007.62s]  Why I picked Kaisa?
[23007.62s -> 23014.39s]  I just felt like playing her.
[23014.39s -> 23015.39s]  We got a back.
[23015.39s -> 23017.39s]  We have to leave the wave in a bad spot.
[23017.39s -> 23029.06s]  Maybe she can push it, but like Wukong's here, so.
[23029.06s -> 23031.06s]  Yeah, we just, okay, we got it nice.
[23031.06s -> 23032.06s]  Not bad.
[23032.06s -> 23036.06s]  So we had to push the wave in there so that the wave will bounce back.
[23036.06s -> 23038.06s]  But we had to do it on a, it was a really bad timer.
[23038.06s -> 23041.06s]  Let me just say, I fucked up the entire early game of this game.
[23041.06s -> 23043.06s]  Like this game is, I'm so bad.
[23043.06s -> 23047.06s]  Essentially, what should have happened was level one when they walked up.
[23047.06s -> 23050.06s]  When Kyson Thresh walked up level one, we should have killed them.
[23050.06s -> 23054.06s]  Like I should have just straight up, hit the thrash with the locks,
[23054.06s -> 23057.06s]  because Thresh walked into our wave because Wukong was level two ganking.
[23057.06s -> 23059.06s]  She should have just killed them. I grieved that.
[23059.06s -> 23062.06s]  And because I went for the Ziya instead, I put myself in a spot
[23062.06s -> 23065.06s]  where I took like 80% of my HP for free, right?
[23065.06s -> 23070.06s]  Which put me behind and now the entire fight was like harder because I was low.
[23070.06s -> 23078.30s]  wait for the way it was just it was really bad really that minion actually just did that
[23082.43s -> 23086.59s]  I don't think we can kill this guy unless she can max range land a queue or something but yeah
[23092.32s -> 23095.76s]  Is there the best they do right out? No, I think Jinx is better
[23096.64s -> 23101.44s]  I think's very good her white game, especially with like paired with the legendary series insane
[23102.32s -> 23104.80s]  But I think Jinx is better for so much you
[23104.80s -> 23116.18s]  I should have to flush. That was a good play hook, but I guess I respect them.
[23116.18s -> 23122.32s]  Hmm, I might have to leave because Wukong can just go here and dive me.
[23122.32s -> 23127.92s]  I actually just have to leave. This feels so bad.
[23127.92s -> 23130.92s]  You see how Wukong just used the plants?
[23130.92s -> 23133.92s]  If I stay, I can just die, right?
[23133.92s -> 23135.92s]  So, I'm just misplaying all over the place.
[23135.92s -> 23138.92s]  I'm taking too much damage. We're playing weak side right now, right?
[23138.92s -> 23142.92s]  What I mean by that is like, we know our Diana's top and we know their Wukong's bot.
[23142.92s -> 23146.92s]  their WooCong spot. So because of that, I need to play a lot less
[23146.92s -> 23149.24s]  trading. Like I walked up and just let the thrash
[23149.24s -> 23152.52s]  fly me for free and I missed two waves now. I need to not do that
[23152.52s -> 23154.84s]  because if I don't miss these waves, it doesn't matter for
[23154.84s -> 23163.14s]  weak sighting because I'm not behind. So it's it's just really stupid.
[23163.14s -> 23165.70s]  Now what I do want to do is I want to go check and see if the WooCong is
[23165.70s -> 23168.90s]  like on our camps or something or if he's doing drag in or some
[23168.90s -> 23178.48s]  shifts. I should not have used the blast cone. Dude, I am so bad.
[23178.48s -> 23180.48s]  I use the blast cone to just hit it.
[23180.48s -> 23184.48s]  It's playing support man. It makes your brain smaller.
[23184.48s -> 23202.66s]  Actually, like I swear, playing support makes my brain smaller.
[23202.66s -> 23212.18s]  Other than dragon.
[23212.18s -> 23234.50s]  Desire is trolling.
[23234.50s -> 23238.45s]  I think.
[23238.45s -> 23240.45s]  Pretty sure I just freeze this. No, with the locks.
[23240.45s -> 23248.09s]  Yeah, she's just trolling. I don't know what the fuck that was.
[23248.09s -> 23255.04s]  I took a little bit of damage, but she has to over extend now.
[23255.04s -> 23283.25s]  Okay, so the Ziya wanted to back the reason that I froze that was because I want the back, but she can't back until we push the way then
[23284.05s -> 23289.49s]  Or until they push the way then, right? So it gives me time to kind of catch up on my back timer with the Ziya
[23290.25s -> 23292.25s]  Because I'm you know a little bit behind in farm
[23301.41s -> 23306.81s]  Thresh is definitely gonna go mid here. He's either gonna go mid or he's gonna try and hook us from the bush
[23308.01s -> 23312.97s]  I think I'm gonna shoot my W through all the bushes here. Okay, Thresh isn't in the bushes
[23313.65s -> 23317.65s]  he's just me a we don't know where he is
[23317.65s -> 23319.65s]  this is awkward because I can't really walk up
[23319.65s -> 23325.03s]  I mean I guess I'm almost sick so I guess I could walk up
[23325.03s -> 23327.03s]  the other is okay we see him
[23327.03s -> 23333.92s]  he's a little five so it's
[23333.92s -> 23337.92s]  we could probably actually fight like if this guy lands a binding I might be able to just
[23337.92s -> 23351.33s]  trade I just I and I'm dead I suck
[23351.33s -> 23353.33s]  honestly I need to do it my bad
[23353.33s -> 23357.73s]  I'm playing bad that's on me
[23357.73s -> 23362.29s]  me. The lock's just playing so good. I needed to, uh,
[23362.77s -> 23366.53s]  W but then back up after the bind. I've just, I'm mechanically
[23367.01s -> 23369.65s]  shitting on myself right now, like out of my mouth, just shit.
[23373.09s -> 23375.73s]  Because I knew exactly what was going to happen when I used W in front of the
[23375.73s -> 23378.85s]  fucking Thresh's face. I was like, here we go. You know what I mean?
[23379.89s -> 23383.17s]  Technically, we're both six and he's five, but he doesn't matter because if I get
[23383.17s -> 23395.83s]  hooks, I don't have enough damage. So now here, I'm going to walk up and see if I can
[23395.83s -> 23402.29s]  stop desires back maybe. I mean, she's backing and a weird spot. Yeah, we stopped their
[23402.29s -> 23409.53s]  backs huge. Okay, now they're in trouble. So they really needed the back on that
[23409.53s -> 23414.77s]  timer because they just want to fight, right? And because they just want to fight,
[23414.77s -> 23425.06s]  they want to go back, right? No way. Dude, fuck off. I cannot dodge a hook right
[23425.06s -> 23434.39s]  to save my fucking life. Jesus Christ. What is my movement man? Like tilting
[23434.39s -> 23451.81s]  myself right now. I want to stay for this wave, but mid is Mia. Yeah, I can't. It feels so bad
[23452.37s -> 23458.13s]  because I needed one more wave to get double pickaxe, so I can get my upgrade. Because like normal
[23458.13s -> 23463.73s]  you go nune quiver pickaxe pickaxe. If you go nune pick pick, it gives you enough AD to get your
[23463.73s -> 23466.31s]  upgrade right and that's like the whole point you don't need crack-in using your
[23466.31s -> 23471.29s]  Q upgrade because your Q upgrade is when you start bursting but because I got hooked
[23471.29s -> 23473.81s]  under the turrets even though we got a kill I had to back and I couldn't get my
[23473.81s -> 23488.56s]  timer I'm so trash I need some coffee that's sort of the as men I swear to God
[23488.56s -> 23522.84s]  coffees my savior it'll save me that wave actually just did that's my holy
[23522.84s -> 23547.81s]  shits we don't actually do anything here crazy no I swap out nice
[23547.81s -> 23562.03s]  nice nice nice that was good to be to
[23562.03s -> 23576.70s]  I got my queue upgrade now we're chillin oh now we're how about chillin oh yeah baby
[23576.70s -> 23592.16s]  you know what it is it's like I'm playing the fights too quick I just got
[23592.16s -> 23607.15s]  to slow down and like think I'm like too hyped up I really don't want to miss
[23607.15s -> 23614.51s]  this wave there's a person right there oh shit let's go okay he's done okay I'm
[23614.51s -> 23616.11s]  I'm gonna go farm bot. Well, that guy gets that.
[23620.85s -> 23622.05s]  This watch is really good.
[23632.34s -> 23634.34s]  I kind of want to, oh, I can't get this point, fuck.
[23636.70s -> 23638.40s]  What? What?
[23639.60s -> 23640.70s]  That was BS.
[23645.52s -> 23648.92s]  Okay, you know what, I'll just take my entire HP bar really quick on the turret.
[23648.92s -> 23649.92s]  It's not a big deal, guys.
[23651.42s -> 23653.02s]  I'm just, I'm bad good at the game.
[23653.02s -> 23656.22s]  My god, I don't mean to brag, but like, you know, professional gamer over here.
[23656.22s -> 23656.82s]  Like, you know,
[23659.52s -> 23661.22s]  I'm gonna be able to want some lessons like I got you.
[23671.00s -> 23672.70s]  Dude, look how big my shield is.
[23672.80s -> 23713.95s]  wait. You son of a bitch. I mean, she's dead, but I got an outplay and man. Mother fucker.
[23713.95s -> 23735.77s]  Alright, they forfein' a nice. Well, I need to make some coffee. I'm playing that. Give me a sec.
[23735.77s -> 23755.31s]  We're playing real bad. I need some coffee. Nice though. We hit 400 LP. Let's go.
[23755.31s -> 23774.83s]  So now we just need 150 more we need 550 I think 550 is GM. I didn't do anything that game by the way. I did nothing
[23776.39s -> 23781.39s]  I could play another AD carry game. That was fun. I'm gonna grab some coffee. I'll be right back
[23782.79s -> 23785.79s]  Talks amongst yourselves boys. I believe in you
[23786.91s -> 23792.29s]  You can welcome my 80 carry tier of us that we've been trying to figure out how to do enjoy. I'll be away
[23792.99s -> 23794.99s]  grab some coffee
[23794.99s -> 23901.98s]  Fucking ass. All right, I'm back. Let's go.
[23901.98s -> 23914.95s]  Let's go. Let's wait. We back boys. We back.
[23914.95s -> 23924.25s]  Time is it. Five. Ooh. Hey, bring a plate for like another hour and then I
[23924.25s -> 23930.17s]  got to get off and make some dinner. Do some other shit. You know I'm saying?
[23930.17s -> 23942.96s]  Where were we? Oh yeah, we're making the tierless. Yeah, I think various is really
[23942.96s -> 23951.12s]  get a. I think verse is good eight here because um my opinion verse is never really like a bad
[23951.12s -> 23956.16s]  pick almost like sometimes he's bad, but I think he's just you can play him on hit or you can
[23956.16s -> 23959.92s]  play him with outie, right? So he's got two builds that you can do based on the game and the
[23959.92s -> 23966.08s]  team comp, because Ulti is pretty much always useful. Like just having a stun like a route on a
[23966.08s -> 23971.04s]  champion is always going to be useful. And then you have he's got very long range, like engage,
[23971.04s -> 23974.64s]  you can safely kill people with this hope in this queue. You can build him
[23974.64s -> 23977.84s]  poke or like before objectives, you can make picks really easily, you can poke
[23977.84s -> 23981.68s]  people out before the objective, get him low. His lane phase is really good if
[23981.68s -> 23985.28s]  you're if you understand like how to play various, his lane phase is exceptional. He
[23985.28s -> 23991.36s]  also has in the meta, currently I feel like he's just like a good pick. I don't
[23991.36s -> 23995.12s]  think he's as good as Draven and Jinks for solo queue, but I do think he's really
[23995.12s -> 24001.32s]  again in general you can you can climb with them really easily and then I put
[24001.32s -> 24007.68s]  ash here too maybe ash I don't know who I'd put in front ash or verse I
[24007.68s -> 24011.96s]  thought maybe ash or maybe verse I think ash is really underrated though I
[24011.96s -> 24030.08s]  think ash is super super good right now I think ash is super good because sorry I'm
[24030.08s -> 24035.24s]  trying to think she's basically the same idea as various she's a little different
[24035.24s -> 24040.20s]  but she's the same idea. She controls lane phase pretty well,
[24040.20s -> 24047.00s]  rally her lane isn't too bad. She also has, like her are always useful no matter what.
[24047.00s -> 24050.20s]  So you always have use with hash, you always have use with various
[24050.20s -> 24053.96s]  are like they just stuns, snares, etc. And so with your,
[24053.96s -> 24057.00s]  she's also really good at being annoying in team fights, like you can take ghost on
[24057.00s -> 24060.60s]  ash and you can just voice and outside the range and if you just
[24060.60s -> 24062.40s]  just to be basically solo people.
[24062.40s -> 24064.44s]  And she actually has decent scaling on her crit now.
[24064.44s -> 24067.08s]  So you can go up on your builds too.
[24067.08s -> 24068.48s]  Like I think you can go Bork Ash,
[24068.48s -> 24070.88s]  you can go Crack and Slayer Ash into Bork
[24070.88s -> 24073.00s]  or you can go Crack and Slayer into IE
[24073.00s -> 24074.40s]  or you can go Crack and Slayer into IE.
[24075.76s -> 24077.76s]  Whatever you can go Shield Bo Ash if they have tanks,
[24077.76s -> 24078.64s]  you can go Gale Force at,
[24078.64s -> 24080.60s]  oh, you can just do a lot of different builds on Ash.
[24080.60s -> 24082.04s]  And I think she's really versatile.
[24082.04s -> 24084.04s]  You can also just go the Onhead build if you really want.
[24085.04s -> 24086.84s]  I think the Rage White build sucks, personally.
[24086.84s -> 24088.04s]  I think that if I was gonna go on hit,
[24088.04s -> 24090.32s]  I would just be like shield bow, widthened,
[24090.32s -> 24092.20s]  until like, Borker's some shit.
[24092.20s -> 24093.08s]  If I was actually gonna do that,
[24093.08s -> 24096.24s]  or shield bow, Borker, Borkwitz or whatever.
[24096.24s -> 24102.33s]  But, yeah, I don't know.
[24102.33s -> 24103.89s]  As well as probably A tier two,
[24105.33s -> 24108.21s]  I said, as well as really gated by like skill.
[24108.21s -> 24110.17s]  So I don't wanna put him in,
[24110.17s -> 24112.09s]  I think if you could play as well perfectly,
[24112.09s -> 24113.13s]  he'd be at the top of S,
[24113.13s -> 24115.61s]  like he would just be above jinx,
[24115.61s -> 24117.41s]  just best champion in the game.
[24117.41s -> 24119.57s]  If you could never miss a skillshot,
[24119.57s -> 24122.93s]  like 100% accuracy play in perfect like the champs and say in rent.
[24122.93s -> 24125.57s]  It's absolutely crazy how good that champ is if you can play in perfect.
[24125.57s -> 24128.41s]  But here are like people are humans, et cetera.
[24128.41s -> 24130.69s]  So I think he's like an A tier pick and solo queue
[24130.69s -> 24132.89s]  because you can get countered like he's not blindable.
[24132.89s -> 24135.45s]  You can get countered pretty easily by good players.
[24135.45s -> 24139.33s]  People play like push comps, people play dive comps like early game.
[24139.33s -> 24142.21s]  I mean, in lane and chess, like because Ezreal's lane is like not,
[24142.21s -> 24146.49s]  it's not bad, but it's very difficult to play Ezreal well in lane fate.
[24146.49s -> 24148.17s]  You gotta be good mechanically.
[24148.17s -> 24151.13s]  And I don't think, even like, I've seen like a challenger player
[24151.13s -> 24151.93s]  so you can't play as a real.
[24151.93s -> 24154.41s]  So he's not easy.
[24155.89s -> 24169.68s]  You know what I'm saying?
[24169.68s -> 24178.13s]  What's up boys?
[24178.13s -> 24197.52s]  So I was gonna bang Kendra, but I couldn't find her.
[24199.16s -> 24205.24s]  I hate Kendra.
[24205.24s -> 24206.76s]  Yo, how are we doing tonight?
[24206.76s -> 24226.86s]  How's everybody's day?
[24226.86s -> 24247.38s]  Okay, so this guy is picking Thresh again.
[24247.38s -> 24260.76s]  Thresh is actually pretty good in the record.
[24260.76s -> 24281.28s]  They have Ziya Thresh again.
[24281.28s -> 24285.00s]  It's quite jinx.
[24285.00s -> 24288.92s]  I like jinx here, even though it is against the rush,
[24288.92s -> 24290.36s]  jinx is a little scary, right?
[24290.36s -> 24299.48s]  But I kind of like her in this situation.
[24299.48s -> 24300.32s]  See what runs.
[24300.32s -> 24301.20s]  Do I want free boots?
[24301.20s -> 24304.16s]  Nah, I think I want, I want to be able to get early boots
[24304.16s -> 24310.67s]  this game, because their team comp is like, oh, yeah,
[24310.67s -> 24312.47s]  their team comp is really, really annoying.
[24312.47s -> 24316.63s]  So I kind of want to get early boots.
[24317.83s -> 24321.79s]  I'll probably go present some minds.
[24321.79s -> 24327.40s]  Although I think over Hill isn't bad.
[24327.40s -> 24333.48s]  Actually, I'll go over here, so yeah, these run so good. Actually, let's do this.
[24335.32s -> 24347.13s]  What is this? This. Yeah, this is good. Okay. I kind of like these. This is good. I'm going to use these.
[24347.13s -> 24353.29s]  Okay. I'm taking claims this game because they have a Sondra and Pantheon and Thresh, right? So
[24353.29s -> 24359.93s]  with the Sondra Pantheon and Thresh, the game's going to be like really fast of like, okay,
[24359.93s -> 24364.33s]  If they stun me, I'm just gonna get CC change and I'm just gonna die like after a bit, right?
[24364.73s -> 24367.65s]  It's gonna be like a stun and they're still on and they're still on and I'm just gonna die
[24371.20s -> 24373.20s]  So I'm like, nah fuck that shit
[24373.20s -> 24401.92s]  Let's see if we can get this double you boys
[24402.40s -> 24412.15s]  What see if I can not fuck up the first three levels to the land?
[24412.59s -> 24419.31s]  Got you, I restricted. Oh, yeah, it's for a while
[24419.95s -> 24448.45s]  It's right it's secret code to make it so I could actually play the game and climb without chatting. Okay
[24449.25s -> 24451.25s]  I should have ordered this bush
[24452.01s -> 24457.53s]  I was drinking my coffee and I didn't think about it. But yeah, if you guys are against the hook champ,
[24457.53s -> 24468.27s]  uh, always ward this bush. Right, like right here, you're going to want to ward here early against the most hook champions,
[24468.27s -> 24475.63s]  because it gives you a very nice, like they can't walk in here and cheese you, they can't walk in here and cheese you,
[24475.63s -> 24511.60s]  so you just don't get cheesed by anything. I mean, that's just, I don't even know what I just saw.
[24511.60s -> 24515.60s]  I'll be real. I don't know what the fuck just happened, but okay.
[24515.60s -> 24518.60s]  Trying to push this way of as fast as I can.
[24518.60s -> 24534.44s]  Not sure I can actually get it pushed fast enough, but we're going to try. It was close.
[24534.44s -> 24543.08s]  No, I'm not going to let it just push. It's not a huge deal.
[24543.08s -> 24548.08s]  It was very close though. We can just break the freeze, right? Oh, it's not a huge deal.
[24548.08s -> 24557.38s]  Are they supposed to win level one? It depends. I mean, Ziya's not that good level one.
[24557.38s -> 24564.14s]  Like she's I it's good because she has her feathers, right, but if you can't stack your feathers of a one, Jinx has more damage
[24564.14s -> 24574.10s]  And they stacked up for my gap or for my rocket, so I got like I've full stacked my lethal tempo, and I just double AoE rocket them over and over and over and over and over again, right?
[24574.10s -> 24577.80s]  And so
[24577.80s -> 24580.60s]  When they finally all end, they were just behind an HP
[24581.96s -> 24584.36s]  Also, Thresh missed, he only had a fly
[24584.84s -> 24613.01s]  Damn, that was so close, man
[24613.01s -> 24634.08s]  like actually if the rest of died there or not the rest of graves have died there we just went in the game
[24648.63s -> 24650.95s]  Yeah, this isn't good. Oh, I'm gonna get flight on dead
[24652.31s -> 24655.19s]  Maybe oh, maybe I'm not dead. I have to walk up like this
[24656.95s -> 24660.39s]  It was a really bad fight by the what what am I watching with the fuck
[24662.07s -> 24664.07s]  That was the bad fight because
[24665.43s -> 24669.43s]  We knew graves was bought and we knew that he was gonna kill in the jungle, right?
[24669.43s -> 24677.17s]  So like my jungler already got out played by Graves once top side. You shouldn't ever take another fight like that bot side
[24677.17s -> 24679.93s]  You should just take the win right like I rotated
[24680.71s -> 24685.87s]  Now granted the Recon should have been there to help kill the graves like when I rotated
[24685.87s -> 24687.87s]  Recon was still jacking off in line
[24688.27s -> 24693.25s]  Right like when I was here Recon was like way down here. So the support should have rotated first
[24693.25s -> 24699.73s]  right, like I rotated, but the support should have been the one rotating, but again he's just a lot of the time you have
[24699.73s -> 24703.49s]  support players who don't understand timers and I had to help jump nobody plays for jungle.
[24704.13s -> 24709.17s]  Support players hate playing for jungle in Lw0, so it's just not a thing.
[24710.37s -> 24714.61s]  So I tried to go over and help him, but I misplaced my traps a little bit,
[24716.29s -> 24719.41s]  and then the graves had a flash, but he got away.
[24719.41s -> 24726.19s]  and they tried to go in again when I was too low to actually help. We just got
[24726.19s -> 24733.45s]  lucky we didn't lose the game off that shit. Kind of does suck those Ziya's
[24733.45s -> 24755.41s]  really strong now. I should know oh I should have killed her. I suppose I could
[24755.41s -> 24761.46s]  have killed the guy. No joke I told I could have killed him. If I had
[24761.46s -> 24767.28s]  warded the lantern as he tried to take it I would have killed the Ziya because she
[24767.28s -> 24781.88s]  egoed the lantern there. She egoed the lantern so hard. If I had, if I had ward of it, she
[24781.88s -> 24800.04s]  dies there. It's my bad. This game is really interesting because the enemy ball lanes actually
[24800.04s -> 24805.00s]  misplaying a lot. Like they're really, really, really misplaying these fights and trades and
[24805.00s -> 24812.76s]  shit. But we can't abuse it because the graves have so much control of the game right now,
[24812.76s -> 24817.80s]  down that we have to basically play safe permanently at the moment and I can't do anything
[24817.80s -> 24837.28s]  to help my team. It feels really bad when my guys again. Yeah, there we go. See what
[24837.28s -> 24854.56s]  graves and bought again man. This is so rough. Graces man. I want to kill this. It's
[24854.56s -> 24872.48s]  fast as I can. We can fight these guys to be too actually. Wait, why didn't you just go
[24872.48s -> 24885.94s]  in? I don't know why he didn't just double you immediately. Like they were con waiting
[24885.94s -> 24891.26s]  Oh that tells me like when she was against the wall here, he should have immediately
[24891.26s -> 24899.74s]  W'd her because if he W's from vision there, right, and she's against the wall, it
[24899.74s -> 24906.54s]  helps us so much because then I can overlay my flame chomps on top of the, I can overlay
[24906.54s -> 24911.94s]  my flame chomps directly on top of the Ziya, right as the fights happening rather than
[24911.94s -> 24914.50s]  and like having to work around the fight
[24914.50s -> 24920.64s]  because the rushes in my face type shit, you know?
[24920.64s -> 24922.00s]  So we're honestly just losing
[24922.00s -> 24923.84s]  because we're not pulling the trigger fast enough.
[24925.76s -> 24930.84s]  And we can't play aggressive when we can pull the trigger.
[24930.84s -> 24931.68s]  Right?
[24931.68s -> 24932.88s]  We're losing because we can't pull the trigger fast enough
[24932.88s -> 24935.48s]  and when we can't pull the trigger, it's the wrong time.
[24938.56s -> 24939.40s]  We do this right now.
[24939.40s -> 24941.00s]  We get dragon.
[24941.00s -> 24942.56s]  The bot lane back, we get dragon here.
[24949.21s -> 24956.34s]  I wanna go, I actually want to go.
[24956.34s -> 24958.58s]  with the enemy bottling didn't back.
[24958.58s -> 24963.28s]  Okay, they're trolling.
[24963.28s -> 24964.44s]  They lost them objective for free here.
[24964.44s -> 24966.00s]  This is really good.
[24966.00s -> 24967.60s]  So the enemy bottling, we fight this by the way.
[24967.60s -> 24979.06s]  We just, we can just straight up fight.
[24979.06s -> 24980.90s]  That right there is how you land,
[24980.90s -> 24983.06s]  are you, you've worn a lancored by the way?
[24985.46s -> 24992.50s]  Oh, I did that guy so dirty.
[24992.50s -> 24993.34s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[24993.34s -> 24994.18s]  Bye guys.
[24994.18s -> 25003.55s]  I didn't know Pantheon was me, that was my bad.
[25003.55s -> 25010.18s]  I was like, I was too happy with warding the lancored by bad.
[25015.14s -> 25018.58s]  I can't believe the enemy team greeted that hard, though, for gold.
[25022.71s -> 25024.71s]  Like, that's actually nuts to me.
[25024.71s -> 25034.60s]  No, yeah, the Ziya's egoing, like, crazy.
[25036.04s -> 25041.56s]  The problem is, I can't abuse it constantly because, like, obviously, like, I need teammates, right?
[25042.44s -> 25047.72s]  But I can kind of abuse it, like, uh, but it's much harder by yourself.
[25051.75s -> 25055.11s]  Because as you can see, like, I'm not playing poorly, but we're getting like,
[25055.11s -> 25059.21s]  Like, we're getting shit on, shit on's a bad word.
[25059.21s -> 25082.87s]  We're getting like, oh come on man, they misplayed that so badly.
[25082.87s -> 25091.11s]  But we're con just ate the fucking, whatever, I'm not gonna blame the con, it's fine.
[25091.11s -> 25097.71s]  I'm so sad about that though, they misplayed that so incredibly badly, like so badly.
[25097.71s -> 25103.71s]  It was just that like, we're con all in the thrash with his ultimate, but all he had to do there was
[25103.71s -> 25110.71s]  uses E to come back to me and then play front to back afterward. But he's he's at their auto wing the Thresh.
[25111.71s -> 25115.71s]  But you don't need the auto him. You just need to engage and then I can maybe play on after it.
[25120.13s -> 25127.28s]  I probably could have double killed them there too. I kind of messed up. My team wants out.
[25128.28s -> 25131.28s]  It's not it's it's silly because the game's not even over.
[25135.25s -> 25137.25s]  Like we actually can win this game so incredibly easily.
[25137.25s -> 25143.11s]  So easily if we just play it correctly because their bot lane is really fucking bad
[25143.11s -> 25147.95s]  I didn't want to be mean, but I'll just be mean their bot lane's really fucking bad
[25155.40s -> 25158.16s]  Well, I'm dead. They're still bad
[25160.00s -> 25162.64s]  I'm just egoing that was my ego
[25164.52s -> 25166.76s]  I still stand by it. I still think they're red
[25167.68s -> 25171.12s]  This is point one B3 mid the threat should have not been mid one time
[25171.12s -> 25186.38s]  so it must be the top winner. I am so frustrated right now with this game because I feel
[25186.38s -> 25191.88s]  like we should have won so many albums that we didn't win, barely, like barely, like barely
[25191.88s -> 25198.22s]  didn't win some albums. I think we should have won all of them. Like they didn't land
[25198.22s -> 25203.42s]  like a good album once, though I shouldn't land a single hook once. And this is my
[25203.42s -> 25207.42s]  like he just tried to... he just used his R to try and engage.
[25207.42s -> 25224.99s]  I think Nocturn is done mentally. Okay, so in games like this, this thrashes so bad.
[25224.99s -> 25249.61s]  Oh, let's go, baby!
[25249.61s -> 25251.61s]  Huge!
[25251.61s -> 25257.84s]  That was so huge, let's fucking go.
[25257.84s -> 25280.90s]  Like I'm gonna hit no at 15 because I really don't want to lose to the thrash in the Ziya.
[25280.90s -> 25283.90s]  Like this thrash is doing the most...
[25283.90s -> 25289.42s]  most the most ego shit I've ever seen and he's just getting away with shit
[25289.42s -> 25295.56s]  like right there the rush walks up with every spell and expects to get away with
[25295.56s -> 25300.38s]  that shit nah nah nah we win these we win these trust give me let me cook let me
[25300.38s -> 25306.06s]  cook I see my team to let me cook a bit you know like we had a bad
[25306.06s -> 25311.66s]  early game how to play weak side let me cook let me cook we are chillin
[25311.66s -> 25373.80s]  I don't know if I landed that, that would have been sick.
[25373.80s -> 25383.44s]  The rest is top two, we can kill this guy.
[25383.44s -> 25385.44s]  Come on guys, don't forfeit.
[25385.44s -> 25388.44s]  Guys, the game is winnable. Oh my god.
[25388.44s -> 25392.44s]  Dude, the game is, how is the recon gonna forfeit?
[25392.44s -> 25398.08s]  Dude, that game is so winnable and hurts.
[25398.08s -> 25404.37s]  Ah, like dude, really?
[25404.37s -> 25412.98s]  That actually is so infuriating.
[25412.98s -> 25414.98s]  That's so infuriating man.
[25414.98s -> 25418.42s]  That game was so incredibly winnable.
[25418.42s -> 25421.77s]  Like look at this.
[25421.77s -> 25425.57s]  I did more damage than every single player on the enemy team.
[25425.57s -> 25431.69s]  If my team just relaxed, we win the game a thousand times
[25431.69s -> 25433.25s]  over that game.
[25433.25s -> 25436.09s]  Like the game is over.
[25436.09s -> 25438.73s]  We have a racon, a rumble, and a woocon for me
[25438.73s -> 25440.69s]  to sit in sit behind.
[25440.69s -> 25443.37s]  And we saw how bad their bot lane was, right?
[25443.37s -> 25447.47s]  I have plans for the only way they can kill me.
[25447.47s -> 25448.31s]  I have a man.
[25448.31s -> 25449.31s]  I wish to God.
[25449.31s -> 25450.15s]  I'm a reporter, mall.
[25450.15s -> 25453.31s]  Like these fuckers, I guarantee I get a notification.
[25453.31s -> 25457.56s]  There's no way these people are not toxic.
[25457.56s -> 25460.52s]  There's no way you, this, like, you just want out of a game
[25460.52s -> 25463.96s]  after a fucking, your team is just doing well.
[25465.36s -> 25466.36s]  No, man.
[25466.36s -> 25471.36s]  The score is 10 to 14, 10 to 14.
[25474.04s -> 25481.52s]  You have a Fed 80 carry.
[25481.52s -> 25482.36s]  Look at this.
[25482.36s -> 25483.40s]  Dude, we forfeited.
[25483.40s -> 25488.52s]  We were down 2.5K.
[25488.52s -> 25491.72s]  We had a better scaling comp than them.
[25491.72s -> 25493.12s]  Like we outscale them.
[25494.96s -> 25496.68s]  We have two dragons.
[25496.68s -> 25498.88s]  We outscale them.
[25498.88s -> 25501.40s]  And we're down 2.5K.
[25502.48s -> 25505.08s]  And my team rage hits forfeit.
[25506.56s -> 25510.16s]  Oh my God, that's so gross.
[25510.16s -> 25518.12s]  That is so disgusting.
[25518.12s -> 25534.24s]  so disgusting. Why am I in a game with this player? I'm 412 LP Masters. I was in a game just
[25534.24s -> 25542.76s]  now with a 7 LP Masters jungler and he's not on a smurf. This is not a smurf account.
[25545.32s -> 25553.03s]  Because last season this guy was D4. So he's not on a smurf. Why is this player in my game?
[25553.03s -> 25564.06s]  Why is this player in a 400 LP master game? Why? Or rather why am I in a Diamond 1 game?
[25564.06s -> 25572.83s]  You can go to his previous games. He doesn't even have good MMR.
[25572.83s -> 25578.83s]  Like if you look at these games, they're all like what 100 to 100 LP, right? Why am I in this game?
[25578.83s -> 25585.27s]  Why did you put me in a game with this player? Like this guy? I don't really care if he sucks.
[25585.27s -> 25591.27s]  I'm more frustrated the fact that these players mental boom at the first sign of any negativity.
[25591.27s -> 25594.05s]  They just give up.
[25594.05s -> 25596.59s]  First sign of anything negative, they go next.
[25597.99s -> 25600.27s]  Like I actually could have won B9 to this game too,
[25600.27s -> 25603.43s]  like actually, but I'm not allowed to try in one B9
[25603.43s -> 25604.83s]  because my team once out of the game
[25604.83s -> 25607.83s]  had fucking four minutes, or 15 minutes.
[25607.83s -> 25609.39s]  That sucks, man.
[25610.71s -> 25613.11s]  The new system is trash.
[25613.11s -> 25618.11s]  Like I'm sorry, but the four-fifth 15 system is good sometimes.
[25618.47s -> 25619.87s]  They should have a requirement
[25619.87s -> 25624.07s]  that you have to be losing by X amount of gold for it to kick in.
[25624.07s -> 25626.11s]  That should, that should be it.
[25626.11s -> 25627.75s]  They should have a requirement.
[25627.75s -> 25634.40s]  You have to be losing by 5K plus for it to work at 15.
[25634.40s -> 25637.88s]  Like there needs to be something where there's
[25637.88s -> 25641.88s]  a requirement because people are so stupid, right?
[25641.88s -> 25643.96s]  Like that game was 100% ours.
[25643.96s -> 25648.20s]  We had two dragons, we're down 2000 gold, at 16 minutes.
[25648.20s -> 25650.48s]  And we'll call on 3 and 1.
[25650.48s -> 25651.80s]  We've done four kills.
[25651.80s -> 25656.96s]  We'll go on three and one.
[25656.96s -> 25660.52s]  I'm literally insanely strong.
[25661.52s -> 25663.48s]  Even though we got weeks, I'm still winning.
[25663.48s -> 25665.40s]  We just two of you two, the bots out of the map, right?
[25665.40s -> 25666.80s]  Wait, we just want a two of you two.
[25668.52s -> 25672.88s]  Rumble's just like, like, ah, sorry, I'm just mad, I'm mad.
[25673.96s -> 25675.32s]  Like, they need to require,
[25675.32s -> 25677.64s]  they need to require something other than four people,
[25677.64s -> 25680.80s]  like require four people and a gold lead or something.
[25680.80s -> 25684.96s]  Like that's so cancer.
[25684.96s -> 25687.04s]  That's so fucking frustrating, man.
[25689.58s -> 25691.98s]  Like I can't believe how bad people's mentals are.
[25693.22s -> 25695.38s]  Like the, okay, I get it.
[25695.38s -> 25697.90s]  The rumble and the rumble in the nocturn,
[25697.90s -> 25700.14s]  I understand wanting to forfeit, okay?
[25700.14s -> 25701.26s]  Okay, they're having a bad game.
[25701.26s -> 25702.50s]  They want out the raging.
[25702.50s -> 25703.50s]  They need to get their frustration.
[25703.50s -> 25704.50s]  I get it.
[25704.50s -> 25709.32s]  But why are we forfeiting?
[25709.32s -> 25711.72s]  When Wukong is three and one,
[25713.04s -> 25715.56s]  I have seven of our KP, I'm the 80 carry,
[25715.56s -> 25717.76s]  I'm very sorry, I just got my mythic.
[25717.76s -> 25718.96s]  We have two dragons.
[25718.96s -> 25722.96s]  And Recon's forfeiting to, I don't know, man.
[25722.96s -> 25734.08s]  Ah, that's just frustrating, is all like, I'm be real.
[25734.08s -> 25765.75s]  I carry this game every day of the week, every day of the week, I carry those.
[25765.75s -> 25770.55s]  So apparently Riot is doing something about smurfing though, and I can't wait until they
[25770.55s -> 25772.55s]  do.
[25772.55s -> 25776.43s]  This is actually a really good thing that I wanted to talk about earlier in the stream,
[25776.43s -> 25777.43s]  but I forgot.
[25777.43s -> 25783.43s]  Apparently, Riot is doing something to make smurfing harder because apparently smurfing is outrageous right now.
[25783.43s -> 25787.43s]  And I kind of think that they need to stop this too.
[25788.43s -> 25795.43s]  So there's a thing you can do in solo queue right now where you can make a new account.
[25795.43s -> 25801.43s]  And you can do it with somebody on different accounts on a new account.
[25801.43s -> 25806.43s]  And your MMR doesn't actually get like lowered.
[25806.43s -> 25812.83s]  So, if you win a game, let's say you win a game,
[25812.83s -> 25819.11s]  I think this is just him leveling the account, but let's say you win a game,
[25819.11s -> 25826.08s]  and in that game, you do all with somebody in a lower MMR, right?
[25826.08s -> 25829.48s]  Now, when you do all in a lower MMR, I don't know if this guy did this or not,
[25829.48s -> 25836.68s]  but when you do all of somebody in a lower MMR, your MMR is based on now the game thinks that you're in that MMR,
[25836.68s -> 25838.92s]  and you can do it in placements.
[25838.92s -> 25841.32s]  So in your very first games, for some reason,
[25841.32s -> 25843.64s]  there's no MMR lock on placements.
[25843.64s -> 25845.32s]  So you can in your placements,
[25846.84s -> 25850.44s]  do all with somebody who's like bronze, right?
[25850.44s -> 25851.96s]  And you can play with them.
[25851.96s -> 25854.12s]  And then the game thinks you're still winning,
[25854.12s -> 25856.12s]  so it keeps amplifying your MMR.
[25857.16s -> 25858.92s]  So when I'm describing this really poorly,
[25858.92s -> 25861.16s]  but essentially you can do all in lower e-lose,
[25861.16s -> 25865.40s]  and the game doesn't know your MMR belongs in that e-lose,
[25865.40s -> 25869.56s]  because you're winning in that yellow, the game can't figure that out for some reason, the algorithm.
[25870.20s -> 25877.56s]  So when they stop dukeuing, it still inflated them. It's still inflated their MMR to where it would be if they
[25877.56s -> 25883.64s]  had so low queued. Does that make sense? And what I'm saying? So it basically says that they went like
[25883.64s -> 25890.20s]  10 and no in their placements, right? So now they're in like a master tier MMR from a brand new account.
[25890.20s -> 25897.20s]  So now those people are in like D1 Masters MMR, but they played, they, they, they, one in gold.
[25897.20s -> 25906.49s]  I also don't think you, smurfing should be so easily accessible.
[25906.49s -> 25913.83s]  Like this guy's not a bad player per se, but I don't think he's a master to a player.
[25913.83s -> 25916.83s]  Right? Like this guy's a rumble player on a new account.
[25916.83s -> 25920.83s]  I, from that game alone, the fact he gave up tells me he's not a good player.
[25920.83s -> 25943.61s]  Dude, I'm, I'm a, head the advocate or for like,
[25943.61s -> 25948.01s]  Riot, you have to attach like a verification to your accounts.
[25949.29s -> 25951.05s]  I know Riot would never do that,
[25951.05s -> 25957.45s]  but I'm like a heavy advocate for like having to attach verification to play ranked.
[25957.45s -> 25961.84s]  I think it'd be great, honestly.
[25961.84s -> 25975.07s]  I think it would help so much.
[25975.07s -> 25976.75s]  If you're very, very account-vandere you're done for it?
[25976.75s -> 25977.95s]  Yeah.
[25977.95s -> 25979.47s]  You have to get like a VPN to play.
[25979.47s -> 25980.91s]  Other than like you would have to.
[25980.91s -> 25982.35s]  That's my point though.
[25982.35s -> 25986.99s]  Like, if you get your very fight account bands,
[25986.99s -> 25989.79s]  Right? Like, okay, that counts done.
[26006.16s -> 26013.76s]  Like I said, I don't think Riot would ever do it because it's too extreme and I don't think Riot has the balls to ever do that shit.
[26014.16s -> 26015.56s]  VPN's only $5.
[26015.76s -> 26021.36s]  Yeah, but dude, are you going to tell me that you're going to buy people who get banned on accounts?
[26021.56s -> 26024.76s]  Typically get banned consistently. That's why they're making spurs.
[26025.96s -> 26026.56s]  Right.
[26027.16s -> 26031.76s]  So you're telling me somebody's going to be willing to pay $5 for a new phone number,
[26031.76s -> 26048.04s]  verification or whatever, every time they have to make a new account, they're not. Not you me.
[26048.92s -> 26055.72s]  Lulu, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Don't I have swirfs? Yeah, I do. And I stand by all my
[26055.72s -> 26062.04s]  swirfs should be attached to the same like account. Well, if you make a smurf, okay,
[26062.04s -> 26067.32s]  this is what I think should happen. You should be able to put all of your swirfs on one account.
[26067.32s -> 26072.44s]  So you can make Smurfs and you can add that Smurfs verification to an account.
[26073.64s -> 26078.68s]  But it kind of like battle.net. Does that make sense? You know, like battle.net has all your accounts
[26078.68s -> 26083.64s]  in the battle.net thing, but you can sign in to battle.net. I think that the way to make it
[26084.20s -> 26089.48s]  viable would be like you could put all, if you didn't have a second phone number didn't want one,
[26089.48s -> 26093.72s]  you could put Smurfs up to like a limit. So you could have like three Smurfs or like two Smurfs
[26093.72s -> 26095.12s]  and your main account, right?
[26095.12s -> 26097.32s]  So you could have like three total accounts.
[26097.32s -> 26099.00s]  And you would have to like,
[26099.00s -> 26100.76s]  you could add those to the same like,
[26100.76s -> 26102.80s]  oh, Omega account, right?
[26102.80s -> 26105.36s]  And that Omega account could be your verified account.
[26105.36s -> 26107.48s]  Now, if any of your accounts get punished
[26107.48s -> 26115.22s]  on your Omega account, all of your accounts get punished.
[26115.22s -> 26116.54s]  So if any of your accounts get punished,
[26116.54s -> 26129.92s]  all of them get punished.
[26129.92s -> 26132.20s]  But I feel like that'd be a good play.
[26132.20s -> 26134.20s]  Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like it would work.
[26134.20s -> 26135.44s]  Yo, what's up, Rush?
[26135.44s -> 26140.97s]  I call you Rush, what's up, Rush?
[26140.97s -> 26142.97s]  Oh, what do I want to play?
[26143.41s -> 26144.41s]  I don't know.
[26145.21s -> 26146.61s]  I don't know what I want to do here.
[26146.61s -> 26150.82s]  It's up to the range, okay.
[26151.14s -> 26152.54s]  I wish I didn't have cleanse.
[26152.54s -> 26155.14s]  Claims is so worthless this game, like actually.
[26156.54s -> 26158.54s]  Claims does nothing this game at all.
[26159.26s -> 26160.62s]  I've just down a sum.
[26160.62s -> 26164.22s]  Like maybe if the brand like tries to flash done me or some shit,
[26164.22s -> 26178.72s]  but I'm just like down a sum, and I'm gonna...
[26178.72s -> 26180.32s]  Alright, boys.
[26180.56s -> 26185.53s]  We got night blue three on our team.
[26185.53s -> 26192.01s]  There's a throwback.
[26192.01s -> 26258.28s]  Yeah, oh, we got him. I'm not gonna lie. I kind of looked like I was scripting
[26260.12s -> 26264.04s]  That that movement like if I was watching the game, I'd be like what the fuck was that?
[26266.00s -> 26273.72s]  Like my movement was real sauce on that like that all-in right there. That's some there's some sauce movement
[26305.53s -> 26308.61s]  We can gank these guys. They have no. Oh, there's gonna be a warden here
[26308.61s -> 26324.76s]  These people have no flashes and we bought land has no flash. This should be a free kill honestly
[26326.12s -> 26329.88s]  We just let these guys put you in they can't walk up and we just play for that
[26334.76s -> 26347.47s]  Even if they try and 3v3 we should just win the 3v3 because we're stronger. Oh, this guy's just dead. Yeah, it's
[26358.16s -> 26360.16s]  I need level 3. I
[26362.96s -> 26367.04s]  Kind of fucked my entire way of here. Yeah, can we push?
[26367.04s -> 26370.74s]  Is there any way we can just push this?
[26377.83s -> 26389.84s]  Ooh nice
[26389.84s -> 26391.84s]  Nice, well, why in
[26392.68s -> 26406.02s]  Last job my blue glue is fucking fetish shit. Oh, I should have gone free boots this game
[26407.06s -> 26409.06s]  I didn't think about it
[26409.78s -> 26411.78s]  Because I
[26411.78s -> 26417.06s]  Don't need Sork this game, you know how like the last game I told you I was going boots. I went boots for the
[26418.26s -> 26421.86s]  You know the fast boot to rush for thresh. I don't need that this game
[26422.26s -> 26429.94s]  because we just went through like faster method.
[26429.94s -> 26433.94s]  So I should have gone three boots for like more efficiency.
[26433.94s -> 26441.86s]  Okay, I'm just stand.
[26441.86s -> 26443.86s]  Now I could just kill the man.
[26443.86s -> 26446.86s]  You can't understand.
[26446.86s -> 26448.86s]  Now I could just kill the man.
[26448.86s -> 26470.41s]  I want to push this way.
[26470.41s -> 26473.41s]  So we don't get like shit on.
[26473.41s -> 26502.07s]  I'm just killing man.
[26502.07s -> 26505.07s]  And you can't understand.
[26505.07s -> 26507.07s]  Just kill man.
[26511.11s -> 26515.19s]  Kill a man, there is something, kill a dust stand.
[26516.19s -> 26517.47s]  Kill a man.
[26544.35s -> 26546.35s]  Hmm, I could go back here, but...
[26547.11s -> 26549.11s]  I don't see any reason to go back yet.
[26558.68s -> 26559.64s]  I think I'm dead.
[26564.30s -> 26565.42s]  Ooh, ooh.
[26565.70s -> 26568.50s]  I misplied that. That was actually really good, but we were like, cool dance.
[26568.50s -> 26569.70s]  No, you're fine, man.
[26569.70s -> 26572.58s]  I wish I could, I wish I could tell him that he played it fine.
[26572.58s -> 26574.70s]  I messed up, not him. I messed up.
[26576.48s -> 26579.48s]  Ah, I feel bad. I want to, like, say, no, you're fine.
[26583.81s -> 26585.01s]  Because that was my bad.
[26585.81s -> 26589.45s]  I should have, okay, so when I flashed and I was running away from the twitch, right?
[26589.45s -> 26593.29s]  The second that twitch flashed on me, I should have instantly started autoing him.
[26593.29s -> 26602.16s]  Like, it was one extra auto, like one single extra auto and it would have been fine.
[26602.16s -> 26606.34s]  Why can't I tell her?
[26606.34s -> 26615.75s]  You know, I just choose not to type anymore, to my choice, you know?
[26615.75s -> 26621.17s]  Yeah, my choice.
[26621.17s -> 26644.59s]  All right guys, actually doing that, huh?
[26644.59s -> 26647.83s]  We went to be too really fucking hard.
[26647.83s -> 26668.20s]  Especially with tier two boots, but I need a dude. I'm doing some scripty shit. I don't know. You real
[26674.00s -> 26678.56s]  Dude, we wasn't six. I thought she was six. I'm so bad
[26681.86s -> 26685.22s]  I wish I could tell her my bad again. I'm actually trolling
[26686.42s -> 26690.10s]  Like I ran out of mana because I'm bad and then I
[26693.48s -> 26698.44s]  And then I thought she was six so I walked up to like take tank the turret for a second right
[26698.44s -> 26702.44s]  Because I was like, oh shit, maybe I'll get like, maybe we can kill this guy, maybe Louis has a spell or something.
[26702.44s -> 26710.46s]  I just, oh, I played bad. My bad.
[26710.46s -> 26713.46s]  W then, make sure Akra is not there.
[26713.46s -> 26722.97s]  I feel I actually just feel so bad, because Louis was actually playing real- it is like the best support I've had all day.
[26722.97s -> 26725.97s]  Like, this guy is actually impressing me, right?
[26725.97s -> 26727.97s]  Like, this guy is playing really well.
[26727.97s -> 26760.82s]  And I'm just griefing.
[26760.82s -> 26765.86s]  Move away for life for me.
[26765.86s -> 26769.56s]  Move away for life for me, boys.
[26769.56s -> 26772.56s]  Can we get a salute for Louis when chat boys?
[26772.56s -> 26774.56s]  I think I got a salute.
[26774.56s -> 26779.38s]  Can we get some blood per ludo?
[26779.38s -> 26788.56s]  She gave her life for the homie.
[26788.56s -> 26807.99s]  Honestly, that was a really cool 2B2, by the way.
[26807.99s -> 26811.99s]  Oh, nice blue smurfing at what the fuck?
[26811.99s -> 26829.89s]  You know kill that bitch too!
[26829.89s -> 26840.63s]  NICE!
[26840.63s -> 26841.63s]  No!
[26841.63s -> 26842.63s]  Oh!
[26842.63s -> 26846.63s]  But lost that cannon, I would have lost my life.
[26846.63s -> 26881.17s]  game. I'm gonna go BT second item. We have Lulu. So wait, what the fuck is this
[26881.17s -> 26885.95s]  pattern? I clicked to go bot and it passed me in the weirdest spot ever. We have
[26885.95s -> 26890.77s]  Lulu. So I could actually go IE second, but I think if I go BT, I'll be actually
[26890.77s -> 26898.88s]  uncutable. Like it'll be the greatest thing ever. I actually still might go IE as I'm
[26898.88s -> 26903.36s]  thinking about it out loud by saying we have Lulu and not be stupid, but hey, I guess
[26903.36s -> 26909.12s]  You know, I still might go I don't know yet. We'll see because I took a lacquer to you so it's like
[26912.36s -> 26925.19s]  Wow
[26925.19s -> 26951.08s]  No, what is that? I mean, I don't know why I flashed away
[26953.08s -> 26955.88s]  I'm playing bad. That's my fault. I
[26957.20s -> 26961.60s]  Think the game's over, so I'm just I'm playing bad. I'm like limit testing a little bit too much
[26972.45s -> 26993.30s]  today
[26993.30s -> 27024.25s]  Mighty
[27024.25s -> 27025.59s]  It's
[27025.59s -> 27040.43s]  a
[27040.43s -> 27041.23s]  one
[27041.23s -> 27042.89s]  Benjamin
[27045.23s -> 27059.13s]  Probably damn it for kidding though. What the fuck dude i
[27059.13s -> 27063.01s]  Just this game although I'm even more mad you guys have no idea
[27064.13s -> 27066.13s]  So i
[27066.63s -> 27071.03s]  It's 24 to 8 the enemy team doesn't for fit but
[27071.07s -> 27073.87s]  My team for fits when the score is 10 to 14
[27075.33s -> 27099.01s]  And we're only down a thousand golds. Sorry, I was that was my bad. I was tilted by
[27099.83s -> 27105.42s]  You know, I was thinking about about how they weren't for putting it. I was getting mad
[27106.94s -> 27109.70s]  It is a little interesting because I said they still can't win
[27110.18s -> 27115.06s]  So I don't know who the fuck said it no, but it's probably echo. Well, no echo is definitely heading no, but like who else?
[27116.90s -> 27123.47s]  Maybe brand maybe ribbon. Maybe ribbon's like yeah
[27123.47s -> 27136.70s]  it. They did just get a thousand gold. All right, I should probably stop throwing. I
[27136.70s -> 27140.70s]  feel pretty silly if we lost because I'm bad. After we had like dumb
[27140.70s -> 27143.78s]  tournament laying that hard, I feel pretty silly if we lost because I keep
[27143.78s -> 27166.30s]  getting caught. All right, I should be unkillable now. Like, I'm not even
[27166.30s -> 27170.26s]  farming. I'm I'm actually griefing. I should probably go make dinner after
[27170.26s -> 27173.46s]  this game. I want to keep playing because I'm playing well today, but like
[27173.46s -> 27177.34s]  dude, my brain is starting to go like, like, I probably need to go make some
[27177.34s -> 27194.51s]  food. I'm getting the full ADHD brain experience going. So let's see if I can
[27194.51s -> 27203.29s]  muster all my focus. Let's see if I can muster up all my focus really quick. Just
[27203.29s -> 27211.79s]  for push out and finish this game. We'll go terminate our mode for the end of this
[27211.79s -> 27225.61s]  game right now. We muster up all of the all of the focus. Demon mode engaged voice.
[27225.61s -> 27279.29s]  God, that sounded really cringe. I'm actually really impressed though. And I put
[27279.29s -> 27285.48s]  played this game really, really well. Like I'll be honest, my last like thought of
[27285.48s -> 27295.75s]  Knight Blue was him being bad at League. He played this game really well. My man's gotten
[27295.75s -> 27307.52s]  so much better. Okay, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody
[27307.52s -> 27310.44s]  saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw
[27310.44s -> 27313.60s]  that, nobody saw that, not one of you saw me flash after the echo, I didn't want to
[27313.60s -> 27323.88s]  Wasted Flash? No, that was assertive Flash.
[27323.88s -> 27329.48s]  An assertive dominant Flash. Not wasted at all.
[27329.48s -> 27338.88s]  They might actually go for Baron here. We should look for this.
[27338.88s -> 27342.88s]  Oh, they could try. Oh, he's here.
[27342.88s -> 27352.32s]  Pretty sure the ribbon's here too, though.
[27352.32s -> 27355.32s]  Yep. I did not mean to do that.
[27355.32s -> 27359.32s]  I didn't mean to hit the thing. I accidentally hit the blast points.
[27359.32s -> 27366.93s]  That was that was an accident. It was a literal pure accident. Like I
[27368.13s -> 27373.33s]  I did not mean to hit it. I was like I know ribbons here. I'm gonna wait for Yosuo before I go over
[27373.81s -> 27378.93s]  Or before I do this, right? And I'm gonna bat him and I just completely whiffed every like I'm bad
[27379.21s -> 27385.65s]  We'll leave it at I'm bad. That's a good way to put I'm bad. I'm hungry. I'm old. I'm bald. I'm bad. Nothing else to say
[27386.89s -> 27388.89s]  short to short man
[27388.89s -> 27406.79s]  Yeah, that was a pedestrian flash.
[27406.79s -> 27416.60s]  It is as well. Oh yeah, it's a plothora, a plothora of terrible things.
[27416.60s -> 27418.60s]  I still got to go to the gym tonight, too.
[27418.60s -> 27445.37s]  It's dead, but okay.
[27445.37s -> 27448.37s]  I'm a little nervous about getting flanked.
[27448.37s -> 27451.37s]  Right, their junglers could just like sit in places.
[27451.37s -> 27471.04s]  Nice, we got top in him, not bad.
[27471.04s -> 27474.04s]  Yeah, I mean, we just try and get mid and hit her.
[27474.04s -> 27477.14s]  the
[27477.14s -> 27500.74s]  one of the
[27500.74s -> 27504.38s]  one of the one I'm actually so sad I'm playing so bad
[27504.38s -> 27516.05s]  like I was playing so good at the start and I'm playing so bad
[27516.05s -> 27529.84s]  actually makes me sad
[27529.84s -> 27540.55s]  I was taking for that guy
[27540.55s -> 27542.15s]  I was just leave
[27542.15s -> 27545.83s]  I don't want to I don't want to throw the game for my teammates
[27545.83s -> 27548.83s]  because like I'm getting like you know
[27548.83s -> 27583.06s]  Dip shit. Oh, where do you go? We should just push bot on a side
[27584.64s -> 27659.82s]  We don't even need a dragon. Okay, we should I'm just gonna push bot not bad not bad at all
[27660.38s -> 27663.30s]  I gotta give it I want to give it the night blue, but I gotta give it to the salivoo
[27664.26s -> 27677.54s]  We would play a dead game so good. I got to give it to Lily. She played so fucking good like actually
[27678.06s -> 27706.94s]  I don't even know if she's still in here
[27706.94s -> 27722.33s]  I'm not a script there.
[27722.33s -> 27733.01s]  She thinks I'm a, no, I'm serious.
[27733.01s -> 27739.50s]  She thinks I'm a script there.
[27739.50s -> 27759.04s]  Bro, I'm streaming.
[27759.04s -> 27763.64s]  I did the homey thought I'm a script there.
[27763.64s -> 27765.52s]  You know, I'll take it.
[27765.52s -> 27776.15s]  My ego feels good.
[27776.15s -> 27777.39s]  Honestly, that feels good.
[27777.39s -> 27778.95s]  That feels good.
[27778.95s -> 27785.12s]  Hi, well, that was a script there.
[27785.12s -> 27786.56s]  Dude, I'm not gonna lie though.
[27786.56s -> 27788.96s]  Some of those movements were sus as fuck
[27788.96s -> 27790.28s]  that I was making.
[27790.28s -> 27794.92s]  Like, I was like, I like turned on the fucking mental scripts for that game.
[27794.92s -> 27799.92s]  Some of those movements early were nuts.
[27799.92s -> 27804.56s]  Like, like, just like this tiny little, tiny little movements I was doing early game and
[27804.56s -> 27806.64s]  lame were crazy.
[27806.64s -> 27808.40s]  Like, look at this, watch this.
[27808.40s -> 27809.60s]  Like, this movement right here, right?
[27809.60s -> 27817.89s]  Like, look, look, I dodge that, right?
[27817.89s -> 27826.66s]  Then I walk up, cleanse the thing, kite down.
[27826.66s -> 27829.62s]  Like that, that movement is gross, man.
[27829.62s -> 27841.20s]  Look, that was actually some gross ass movement. I'm not gonna lie it. Look at this in the corner man in the corner
[27843.20s -> 27852.70s]  My brain was like, y'know, and drama. Thank you man. Yo, you played really good. Now I felt bad
[27852.70s -> 27858.54s]  I felt so bad because I was griefing like I was like at the start of the game
[27858.54s -> 27864.18s]  We were just snowed like I literally fucked up like three times during like the really important fights
[27864.18s -> 27870.42s]  and I was like, oh no.
[27870.42s -> 27872.02s]  Yeah, they're either the bits.
[27872.02s -> 27873.22s]  Can I play Clista?
[27873.22s -> 27878.31s]  I can.
[27878.31s -> 27881.07s]  I'm trying to figure out if I want to play a Clista game,
[27881.07s -> 27889.15s]  or if I want to go my dinner.
[27889.15s -> 27892.07s]  There was one other movement that I thought was kind of nuts.
[27892.07s -> 27894.31s]  I did a really good movement to somewhere.
[27894.31s -> 27898.56s]  I don't remember what it was.
[27898.56s -> 27900.00s]  Here's where I fucked up.
[27900.00s -> 27902.92s]  So right now, I should have just been,
[27902.92s -> 27904.88s]  for some reason, my brain lagged,
[27904.88s -> 27907.84s]  and I should have just been sitting here.
[27907.84s -> 27909.68s]  I should have just cleansed and then started
[27909.68s -> 27911.48s]  fighting the Twitch.
[27911.48s -> 27913.16s]  For some reason, I didn't cleanse,
[27913.16s -> 27914.84s]  but this wasn't like your fault at all.
[27914.84s -> 27917.08s]  Like, the second the Twitch flashed,
[27917.08s -> 27918.92s]  I should have insta cleanse the ignite,
[27918.92s -> 27920.80s]  and I should have just been killing him.
[27920.80s -> 27922.04s]  Like, right now, just like autoing,
[27922.04s -> 27923.64s]  because I can't get away from him, right?
[27923.64s -> 27925.88s]  But it took me an extra second, see how I,
[27925.88s -> 27929.95s]  I start fighting him now.
[27929.95s -> 27931.71s]  Like, I barely died.
[27931.71s -> 27932.99s]  I wouldn't have died.
[27932.99s -> 27935.75s]  Had I cleansed, and had I just turned on initially.
[27935.75s -> 27936.47s]  It was fine.
[27941.98s -> 27944.14s]  And then like, here, I fucked up too,
[27944.14s -> 27954.70s]  because I went in and I thought we were six.
[27954.70s -> 27956.10s]  Oh, I could have killed that guy.
[27957.30s -> 27959.70s]  I should have gone forward one more.
[27959.70s -> 27961.30s]  Oh, you know what I should have done there?
[27961.30s -> 27963.86s]  I should have gone forward one more auto, killed this guy.
[27963.86s -> 27966.30s]  Lulu would have gotten six off of the kill.
[27966.30s -> 27968.66s]  I would have used my speed to come back out.
[27968.66s -> 27969.82s]  Then she could have altered me.
[27969.82s -> 27972.86s]  We could have killed the twitch,
[27972.86s -> 27981.92s]  and then we could have turned on this echo too.
[27981.92s -> 27984.44s]  Oh, this was a really cool TV2.
[27985.76s -> 27988.12s]  I actually thought this TV2 was really sick.
[27988.12s -> 27997.81s]  move is a real one for this man listen you're a real one for this one you
[27997.81s -> 28013.45s]  just took the debt to save me respect you're real one for that that was so
[28013.45s -> 28023.37s]  good Jesus was fun yeah Jesus you were the best support I've had today like
[28023.37s -> 28026.73s]  legitimate you played better than all the other players in the sea though I was
[28026.73s -> 28030.53s]  really good like I was surprised I was telling my stream I was like yeah this is
[28030.53s -> 28033.29s]  She's actually like, they, I said cheeks here.
[28033.29s -> 28034.61s]  I'm like, I don't know, you know.
[28034.61s -> 28037.77s]  But I was like, yeah, she's playing super good.
[28037.77s -> 28039.81s]  It's playing way better than all of my fucking demons.
[28044.74s -> 28047.02s]  Yo, what's the time I said it?
[28047.02s -> 28051.50s]  Six, man, do I want to keep streaming or do I want to go,
[28051.50s -> 28056.32s]  or do I want to go get food and go to the gym?
[28056.32s -> 28059.76s]  I can't, 24 hour fitness is not actually 24 anymore.
[28059.76s -> 28067.00s]  So I have to go soon if I'm going to go to the gym.
[28067.00s -> 28078.25s]  What is this only like six?
[28078.25s -> 28081.38s]  Hmm.
[28081.38s -> 28083.34s]  But I could just end on,
[28084.42s -> 28085.78s]  I could just end on the,
[28085.78s -> 28091.63s]  hitting the like 400 LP mark and just chill for now.
[28091.63s -> 28092.75s]  Right, like we have 400 LP,
[28092.75s -> 28094.51s]  we'll probably hit GM tomorrow.
[28096.07s -> 28097.31s]  So I could just chill for now
[28097.31s -> 28101.47s]  and then we could just hit GM tomorrow.
[28101.47s -> 28103.87s]  That's probably a better idea
[28103.87s -> 28107.39s]  because then I won't get mad, like say, say we get another game
[28107.39s -> 28108.39s]  like this, right?
[28109.79s -> 28111.51s]  Like say we get another game like this
[28111.51s -> 28114.23s]  We're literally winning the game and my team's like,
[28114.23s -> 28115.15s]  no, let's forfeit.
[28115.15s -> 28116.23s]  Like, that's gonna make me mad.
[28116.23s -> 28117.07s]  I was mad.
[28117.07s -> 28118.07s]  This is gonna make me mad, right?
[28118.07s -> 28121.15s]  Like I, so I'd rather just like get off on a good note.
[28121.15s -> 28129.94s]  Like a happy note, you know, like not be tilted.
[28129.94s -> 28130.78s]  GM tomorrow?
[28130.78s -> 28131.62s]  Yeah, I hope so.
[28131.62s -> 28133.82s]  I've been, I think I can get challenged back this year,
[28133.82s -> 28136.42s]  but we gotta get to GM first.
[28136.42s -> 28139.46s]  I'm telling you, this ELO is so miserable.
[28139.46s -> 28144.46s]  Like, master tier is the worst ELO I've ever played in
[28144.46s -> 28154.90s]  in my 12 years of playing this game, whatever NA 300 400 LP masters is is literally
[28154.90s -> 28156.74s]  disgusting.
[28156.74s -> 28159.74s]  These are not real people.
[28159.74s -> 28167.40s]  I feel like half of these games we are playing with NPCs who quite literally don't even
[28167.40s -> 28172.14s]  like I don't even know what to say of their bots and they can't be real humans.
[28172.14s -> 28175.58s]  They get mad over nothing, they rage quit over nothing,
[28175.58s -> 28179.30s]  they give up at 15 minutes when we're winning the game.
[28179.30s -> 28182.89s]  These cannot be real people.
[28182.89s -> 28187.41s]  So I swear to God, the game has to get better in GM.
[28187.41s -> 28189.17s]  It has to get better.
[28189.17s -> 28192.25s]  There's no world that it gets worse.
[28193.29s -> 28195.21s]  Like, I refuse to believe that.
[28196.21s -> 28202.98s]  Cause this is the worst grind I've ever had.
[28202.98s -> 28206.81s]  Is it bad to be a bot?
[28206.81s -> 28210.26s]  Are you saying I'm botist?
[28210.26s -> 28213.38s]  I really can't tell me because I don't like bots.
[28213.38s -> 28214.30s]  I said it.
[28214.30s -> 28215.14s]  I'm saying it.
[28215.14s -> 28216.46s]  I don't like fucking bots.
[28216.46s -> 28219.38s]  Well, okay, didn't need to add fucking, you know what,
[28219.38s -> 28220.50s]  we're just gonna, I'm gonna get off.
[28220.50s -> 28222.10s]  I'm gonna, yeah, that's it, that's it for me.
[28222.10s -> 28225.78s]  Uh, I'm gonna get off with, I'm tired.
[28225.78s -> 28228.18s]  I need to go to the gym before I run out of juice,
[28228.18s -> 28229.74s]  make some dinner.
[28229.74s -> 28231.94s]  I will be live tomorrow, same time as today.
[28231.94s -> 28234.06s]  I've been starting my stream at 10 a.m.
[28234.06s -> 28235.50s]  My time.
[28235.50s -> 28238.82s]  Maybe I'll do it tomorrow at 9 a.m.
[28238.82s -> 28240.06s]  I don't know, it's 10 or nine.
[28240.06s -> 28246.54s]  between there I always start my stream and so and that's my time so it's like seven eight nine
[28246.54s -> 28253.62s]  PST you're good at 80 thanks man. I think I suck my goal is hopefully I can get
[28253.62s -> 28260.22s]  challenge your back and then I'm not gonna play like I just want my goal is challengeer so that
[28260.22s -> 28266.06s]  I can prove to myself it's a really stupid thing but I want to prove to myself that I can still
[28266.06s -> 28270.62s]  do it at 32 because 10 years ago was the first time I started streaming this year. I've
[28270.62s -> 28275.90s]  been streaming for 10 years this year and so I want to get Challenger. Because when I first
[28275.90s -> 28279.90s]  started streaming I was in Challenger and I want to see if like after 10 years I can still do it
[28282.06s -> 28286.46s]  and then I'm never going to care again. This will be the only time I ever give a shit about
[28286.46s -> 28290.70s]  getting Challenger. I just want to get it, see if I care and then point for content, you know.
[28290.70s -> 28300.78s]  But yeah, it's just, it's just like, well, come to the league of Draven, see if the old man who has fucking arthritis and
[28301.42s -> 28305.02s]  fucking carpal tunnel and all that shit, you know what I mean? See if I still do it.
[28306.86s -> 28309.90s]  Yeah, thank you for the twitch prime man. I appreciate it. Thank you so much.
[28310.46s -> 28318.38s]  Appreciate it a lot, dude. All right guys, that's gonna be it for me. If you like the stream, don't forget to follow all my socials and TikTok and Facebook and Instagram and all that shit's all the
[28318.38s -> 28323.18s]  clickable garbage is underneath the stream. Don't forget to check it out. I'll be back tomorrow
[28323.18s -> 28328.46s]  same time in the morning. Tomorrow's my last day for the weekend though. I'm not gonna stream
[28328.46s -> 28333.50s]  on Saturday. I might do some off-stream grinding on Saturday. I've been taking, I've been like
[28333.50s -> 28339.02s]  forcing myself to take a day off of streaming every week just so I can mentally recharge. And I
[28339.02s -> 28343.50s]  think it's actually been really good for my stream because like I've been in a much better mood
[28343.50s -> 28348.54s]  while streaming and I've been much else tilted and I've been even if I play League off stream or whatever
[28348.54s -> 28353.18s]  it's just like it doesn't feel as forced so I feel like the break's nice so yeah tomorrow
[28353.18s -> 28357.58s]  no stream on Saturday tomorrow for sure and Sunday I might I might do a short stream
[28358.14s -> 28364.82s]  but yeah I'll see you guys then thanks for watching I appreciate you guys and yeah that's it
[28364.82s -> 28370.66s]  I'm gonna go make dinner oh we guys have a good night day wherever the fuck you are
[28371.46s -> 28375.38s]  better dudes oh we guys have a good one I was fun playing with it and drama
[28375.38s -> 28380.98s]  go look at the games. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Peace.
