[190.19s -> 195.62s]  Yeah, that guy has
[195.78s -> 196.98s]  GP
[196.98s -> 215.42s]  bees
[215.42s -> 216.90s]  Jesus
[216.90s -> 270.73s]  Yo, it was a man. What's up dudes?
[318.94s -> 320.94s]  Yeah, I mean, we're hoping
[321.20s -> 327.59s]  We'll see man. We'll see
[330.25s -> 390.99s]  Fingers fucking crossed right do I ever actually?
[392.15s -> 408.17s]  I'm wondering if I I'm assuming I'm just playing a math
[462.42s -> 463.70s]  Yay
[463.70s -> 484.16s]  Yes, it's probably just me doing fucking. I'm probably just doing star guardian
[498.34s -> 502.08s]  Welcome to the room for the 27 months man
[503.48s -> 530.98s]  Appreciate it a lot dude. Thank you, and I could probably still go infinite team, but so I'm holding the solution
[531.72s -> 533.72s]  But I haven't seen any severs or anything
[534.80s -> 619.95s]  So it'd be kind of awkward, you know this guy's definitely gonna beat me that guys I
[621.03s -> 625.19s]  See why he hasn't lost that's he has five infinity team already. Jesus Christ. I
[626.31s -> 628.95s]  Was like man, why is that guy so strong and then I like realized
[629.55s -> 780.80s]  So I go to seven next rounds, and then hopefully we can hit
[782.14s -> 806.32s]  Some shit I kind of like this actually because now we can make I
[807.60s -> 809.28s]  can actually make a
[809.28s -> 811.28s]  Guard breaker and I could also make
[811.76s -> 848.94s]  We go like guard breaker and math. I kind of want to just ionic spark, but I don't know if I should I need
[850.32s -> 852.32s]  an echo a
[852.40s -> 854.40s]  Niko or a round
[854.40s -> 857.40s]  I also could use an Ezreal. I need like a quick draw.
[858.40s -> 876.02s]  I should have kept that Lucian from earlier.
[876.02s -> 880.02s]  He's got a level 3 Blitzcrank and he's just so fucking strong it's stupid.
[880.02s -> 950.92s]  This is really interesting.
[950.92s -> 975.23s]  I guess I could go Spell Singer as well.
[975.23s -> 978.23s]  And we can just give the Shiv to TF.
[978.23s -> 1007.98s]  We can just do this for now too.
[1007.98s -> 1037.21s]  I guess I could use...
[1037.21s -> 1042.18s]  I could do Jeweled Gauntlet.
[1042.18s -> 1044.50s]  I don't know.
[1044.50s -> 1048.51s]  Could Jeweled Gauntlet this shit up?
[1048.51s -> 1104.89s]  See how it goes. I need to like throw an item down
[1105.93s -> 1119.86s]  But I feel like morellos is bad. I guess I could just use hat or like I said before jeweled gauntlet could be good
[1119.86s -> 1148.00s]  I don't know. I could just roll on seven to try and three star stuff
[1148.40s -> 1155.78s]  This guy has three Kaisa's though. This guy has one Kaisa
[1156.30s -> 1161.78s]  Kind of hard to three star Kaisa. I could three star Nila
[1162.62s -> 1193.10s]  They're gonna sell eight with fucking 20 gold
[1193.10s -> 1297.47s]  He already has MF and... dude Bloodscraping is insane.
[1297.47s -> 1357.48s]  Dude that gnar just merked me.
[1357.48s -> 1371.58s]  I did not position for the gnar and I got fucked for it.
[1371.58s -> 1399.18s]  This motherfucker.
[1399.18s -> 1404.18s]  Dude I wish I could get some thick front line leveled up.
[1404.18s -> 1420.06s]  That'd be cool.
[1420.06s -> 1546.33s]  Oh my god another NAR well rip I was gonna go MF and then I like decided to go Niko
[1546.33s -> 1572.54s]  and then I just fucked it all up oh well oh well time is at 10
[1572.54s -> 1645.38s]  What's up boys, how's everybody doing oh, I'll be right back so I'm still waking up. Let me give me one sec
[1646.46s -> 1648.46s]  sub sky oh
[1675.18s -> 1677.18s]  Okay, oh
[1679.72s -> 1682.84s]  Yeah, baby. I was gonna play on my man at the start, but dude
[1682.84s -> 1687.28s]  I don't know if I can sit through fucking eight minute queue times to get people raging at each other all day
[1687.60s -> 1690.32s]  So we'll we'll do some warm-up on this account for a bit
[1690.92s -> 1705.92s]  What am Mars's count like D1 low master?
[1706.42s -> 1719.64s]  Like my other counts like 500 this one's I want to say like I don't know the MMR is really awkward
[1720.54s -> 1723.34s]  When you get like low masters right like the MMR super awkward
[1723.62s -> 1727.82s]  So I don't know what the MMR is, but I know it's low masters. So like sometimes there's diamonds
[1727.82s -> 1729.82s]  Sometimes there's like hundred LP players
[1731.02s -> 1744.68s]  Some more between there dude. I I played some games off stream yesterday. I got up to like 400 LP
[1745.80s -> 1747.80s]  Then I lost three in a row
[1748.04s -> 1756.06s]  That shit was painful. I did
[1756.70s -> 1766.90s]  Into one of tenacity's games though. So that was fun. That felt bad
[1767.34s -> 1773.46s]  No, yeah, straight up. It felt so bad. He was doing so good, too
[1773.50s -> 1780.25s]  Well, I straight up just had a bad game and I felt I felt like shit. Look at this shit
[1780.25s -> 1782.25s]  I just dropped like eight deaths. Look at the shits
[1785.05s -> 1787.93s]  Like he was just straight up smurfing on the enemy top laner
[1788.69s -> 1793.21s]  And we all the entire team just like decided to collectively run it down
[1793.73s -> 1803.50s]  Like we all just got shit on this was a really weird game
[1804.02s -> 1808.17s]  because I feel like
[1808.17s -> 1813.41s]  That game was like the first game. I felt everybody in the game was like actually high GM challenger
[1813.41s -> 1814.97s]  But they weren't right at that
[1814.97s -> 1817.37s]  There's a very weird system going on
[1822.66s -> 1829.94s]  Let's do a Cassiopeia game
[1829.94s -> 1845.43s]  Like I'll show you guys what I mean in a second. I'm assuming I should go this right? This is probably good
[1846.23s -> 1848.07s]  or this
[1848.07s -> 1857.52s]  That's probably good, too. Oh well, okay, so yeah, we'll get this stuff
[1858.54s -> 1865.42s]  Like Nian Tonso is like he's been challenger for a long time, right? I don't even know who the fuck this guy was
[1867.30s -> 1876.12s]  Some random Senna player who's like not playing Senna now and then this guy was like trying to jungle and just like running it down
[1877.86s -> 1881.30s]  It was, I don't even know, it was the weirdest game that I've played in a while.
[1882.98s -> 1885.70s]  Cause like, my AD carry wasn't bad.
[1886.58s -> 1890.66s]  Like this guy's clearly like on a smurf, but I don't know how good he was, cause he wasn't bad at the game.
[1892.34s -> 1893.94s]  The enemy AD carry wasn't bad.
[1895.30s -> 1896.74s]  This guy's also on a smurf.
[1897.54s -> 1900.50s]  It was the weirdest lobby, it was like a bunch of smurf accounts,
[1901.46s -> 1904.42s]  all playing with each other, but it was like a non-smurf queue.
[1908.29s -> 1909.81s]  This guy was like the only non-smurf.
[1909.81s -> 1925.25s]  It was interesting. Ooh, do I take ghost here, or do I just I
[1925.81s -> 1939.28s]  Thought ghosts could be really OP versus their team with Cassiopeia, but maybe I should just take I'm gonna try it
[1939.92s -> 1946.62s]  I don't somebody dodged cuz yeah, I don't I never know I never know if I should take ghost ignite whatever
[1948.46s -> 1954.64s]  Because I feel like ghosts with Cassios feels like the same thing's AD carry right same idea where it feels really OP
[1963.32s -> 1966.76s]  Dude, there's so much drama going on in the league community yet again
[1967.36s -> 1974.98s]  By the way, like it's insane.
[1974.98s -> 1996.06s]  Yeah, I don't know man.
[1996.06s -> 2009.86s]  I just, I'm just, I like looking at drama because like drama is juicy.
[2009.86s -> 2017.16s]  Like I like looking at drama but it's also like, how are people so stupid?
[2017.16s -> 2037.98s]  Yeah, I'm getting like, I don't know man.
[2037.98s -> 2044.42s]  My view on all of this shit is like, I guess I'm just not hardwired that way.
[2044.42s -> 2050.46s]  I can't mentally wrap my head around being like excited to flirt with underage girls or
[2050.46s -> 2066.15s]  like when I just I never like had the want like it happens so much between like league
[2066.15s -> 2068.75s]  streamers and non like just it's not even a league thing it's just that we're in the
[2068.75s -> 2075.95s]  league community right so you see it more dude like well the drama is like a decent
[2075.95s -> 2080.15s]  size league streamer who was like getting bigger or whatever like the ad carry streamer cookie
[2080.15s -> 2092.80s]  roll or whatever he was like somebody made a 90 page 90 pages of Google Doc to basically
[2092.80s -> 2099.08s]  like expose this guy for like talking a bunch like sexually to underage girls not paying
[2099.08s -> 2112.68s]  his fucking like mods who do work for him and like other stuff and I'm like dude how
[2112.68s -> 2123.20s]  man like just be a normal human it's not that bad like I take it from me being
[2123.20s -> 2203.65s]  a normal dude it's not that bad sorry I was distracted no uh yeah I don't know
[2203.65s -> 2210.65s]  man I swear to God people are just stupid as fuck people were idiots there's
[2210.65s -> 2214.57s]  got to be some psychological underlying issue with people's brains not working
[2214.57s -> 2221.26s]  But it is what it is. Huh? I've had this market account for a while
[2222.58s -> 2224.58s]  huh
[2228.73s -> 2230.97s]  Dude, what is that tarik skin?
[2233.78s -> 2237.54s]  You see this we this tarik skin man. He's fabulous
[2238.70s -> 2240.54s]  Good day
[2240.54s -> 2242.54s]  My man's just straight up fabulous
[2256.38s -> 2258.38s]  People are desperate. I
[2258.54s -> 2263.86s]  Just can't like I don't think like I've been in the situation whereas I was like a really really big streamer
[2263.86s -> 2269.22s]  like much bigger than he is and I got like this is what I'm saying is like I
[2269.22s -> 2275.18s]  understand like all of the crap that gets thrown at you like people will
[2275.18s -> 2280.10s]  literally message you for no reason like you do have like fans that have like
[2280.10s -> 2284.98s]  when I was at my biggest point like you have fans that are younger girls guy it
[2284.98s -> 2289.10s]  doesn't matter and like you just gotta like I just never in my mind I guess
[2289.10s -> 2292.90s]  thought like oh I'm gonna flirt with these people like it made me like I
[2292.90s -> 2297.96s]  I don't even I wouldn't even I literally didn't even see them as like sexual in my brain
[2302.53s -> 2304.53s]  Like it blows my mind
[2304.69s -> 2311.00s]  And then the fact that like if you like if you look at the Google Doc or whatever
[2311.88s -> 2316.26s]  The fact that like taco like I keep a taco whatever it was literally talking to him
[2316.66s -> 2320.14s]  Telling him he was doing it like what he was doing was wrong. He was like, yeah, I get it, right?
[2320.68s -> 2322.68s]  Then he did it again
[2322.68s -> 2336.28s]  dude the set alting the pussy that that
[2336.28s -> 2340.36s]  I'll be honest that may be one of the funniest lines I've ever heard
[2355.08s -> 2359.04s]  Like dude, I mean whatever, you know, I'm not here to kink shame whatever gets people off
[2359.04s -> 2362.42s]  You know, maybe maybe maybe that's a fetish. I don't know
[2394.91s -> 2399.68s]  Safe and sounds either way
[2399.68s -> 2403.54s]  Don't worry, we can not talk about the drama real quick.
[2403.54s -> 2426.69s]  We can talk about how old and washed up wings of death is though.
[2426.69s -> 2427.69s]  I'm kidding.
[2427.69s -> 2436.41s]  Yo, did you see on a glider note though, did you see Riot?
[2436.41s -> 2439.93s]  There was like a Reddit thread or something where Riot was saying that they're like gonna
[2439.93s -> 2444.75s]  try and do something about smurfing in the next few months.
[2444.75s -> 2457.85s]  I don't know what that means, but can you tell us something involving wings
[2457.85s -> 2463.69s]  Just between us. Yeah, yeah just between us and all the homies. Yeah, yeah in chat. Yeah, yeah, nobody else say anything. It's fine. Yeah, no
[2467.26s -> 2478.86s]  What's up?
[2478.86s -> 2503.50s]  My chatting snitches when I was a teen I made a montage of him having breakdowns in my games. Oh my god
[2504.18s -> 2506.18s]  That's amazing. Oh
[2510.42s -> 2517.08s]  My god, that's amazing. I feel like I need to pay you to see this montage
[2518.14s -> 2520.14s]  Like I will give you money
[2520.14s -> 2548.33s]  I need to see this is important to me. Oh, I have dude you should see the I I have so many rage
[2548.33s -> 2565.57s]  complications about me it's crazy so many I had a I had a villain arc for sure I feel
[2565.57s -> 2576.20s]  you just comes with like being a League streamer we players are not all mentally healthy for me
[2576.20s -> 2593.29s]  let me tell you take it from me add okay I'd like to think I'm not a villain anymore fuck
[2593.29s -> 2625.42s]  you I really want this plate nice dude a nibbius roaming why is there wukong
[2625.42s -> 2637.45s]  just sitting top by the way that's actually hilarious you know it's
[2637.45s -> 2647.34s]  interesting I feel like Tarek actually missed that stun I was kind of
[2647.34s -> 2672.34s]  side-eyeing that but I feel like he missed that stun somehow I feel like
[2672.34s -> 2676.42s]  this is the easiest game I've ever played by the way I'm on full autopilot
[2676.94s -> 2681.96s]  Rain still waking up and I feel like they're just walking into me on repeat. I'm just killing them all. I
[2682.66s -> 2684.66s]  Don't even know what the fuck's going on
[2685.54s -> 2690.02s]  Like they it feels like the enemy team has not like they didn't they didn't like understand
[2690.02s -> 2693.70s]  We were playing league right like they queued up and they were like, oh, yeah, this is league
[2694.94s -> 2696.94s]  That's what this feels like
[2697.66s -> 2701.66s]  This is what I imagine if like Mike Tyson went into a preschool, you know what I mean like this is what this feels like
[2701.66s -> 2737.70s]  much say I probably could have killed those guys but I don't want to the
[2737.70s -> 2762.79s]  chill I'm assuming the wukong is gonna come bot soon there is damn it I
[2762.79s -> 2772.47s]  quins late I actually kill bull that was a late quins by me my bed I don't
[2772.47s -> 2776.91s]  want to take the rest coming back up she stuns me they get one shot me I
[2776.91s -> 2782.95s]  should have killed the fucking guy though the wukong I just backed up too
[2782.95s -> 2796.24s]  far and then I cleansed the stun for no like really late hi there it was a man
[2796.24s -> 2800.60s]  so boys good evening good evening good morning I don't know where the fuck you
[2800.60s -> 2833.28s]  guys live so good day fuck am I watching wait that wukong lived whoa
[2833.28s -> 2845.10s]  bro oh and I'm dead dude that wall was BS there was like a little hole and then I
[2845.10s -> 2848.60s]  flashed late because I was like oh I could walk out the hole but I couldn't
[2848.60s -> 2855.54s]  walk out the tiny little hole motherfuckers I shouldn't have even been there
[2855.54s -> 2864.01s]  but like I'm stupid I should have pushed bot I was like dude that's such a
[2864.01s -> 2868.41s]  bad fight but I walked over to those like I'm really fat honestly I probably
[2868.41s -> 2878.52s]  could have killed him if I didn't, if I had like flashed the stun. Annie stun is the only
[2878.52s -> 2883.38s]  like most over, like I swear if they reduced Annie stun by like 0.5 seconds she would never
[2883.38s -> 2890.48s]  get played. Like actually the only reason to play Annie is her stun is just so OP.
[2890.48s -> 2895.32s]  Cause it's like a, it's like the reason they changed Tarak so long ago where like
[2895.32s -> 2902.58s]  When you have a point click CC, it's typically really broken.
[2911.32s -> 2912.62s]  Okay, I'm just dead.
[2913.92s -> 2916.32s]  Does Taric not have ult leveled up at 6?
[2921.75s -> 2923.15s]  He didn't level his ulti.
[2940.88s -> 2941.68s]  Maybe it's...
[2941.88s -> 2943.38s]  Maybe Taric ult sucks.
[2945.19s -> 2947.19s]  Maybe it's underpowered, you know?
[2948.99s -> 2950.39s]  No, yeah, he must have misclicked.
[2959.40s -> 2960.60s]  Honestly, I'm just briefing.
[2960.60s -> 2962.80s]  I'm like, playing too aggro for like...
[2963.90s -> 2965.80s]  Like, I threw my lead because I was like,
[2965.80s -> 2971.08s]  Oh shit. I'm gonna walk over and help the homies. You never walk over and help the homies when the homies are getting shit on because
[2972.32s -> 2977.12s]  If you have like 900 gold or a thousand gold lead like it like I did or whatever you don't want to do that's because
[2977.80s -> 2979.08s]  You'll give
[2979.08s -> 2983.42s]  MF a ton of kills
[2983.42s -> 2985.42s]  We're in a good spot now though
[2985.54s -> 2996.08s]  But I am still a little
[2996.28s -> 2998.28s]  Wait, Tarek. Oh, I've got this old nurse
[3000.55s -> 3002.95s]  This Tarek does not know how to play Tarek, by the way
[3003.63s -> 3007.13s]  He's throwing out his stun so awkwardly
[3007.81s -> 3013.91s]  That's okay though. I mean I apparently don't know how to play driving so
[3018.29s -> 3027.29s]  Can't really blame the guy. I mean you guys are doing dragon with no smite
[3031.23s -> 3046.71s]  But it seems like doing dragon with no smite. I mean we could fight these fights, but
[3048.31s -> 3052.18s]  It's like painful
[3052.18s -> 3057.61s]  We could easily fight these fights. I think a lot of it is just like
[3058.41s -> 3063.09s]  Terrik isn't confident enough to walk up and stun right like that's that's what I'm seeing the issue is
[3063.09s -> 3068.13s]  He's doing the thing where like he's not he doesn't have the confidence to actually walk up since he's a melee champ
[3068.97s -> 3074.11s]  So he's walking up and like taking half his health
[3075.07s -> 3077.07s]  And it's making him nervous
[3077.31s -> 3079.31s]  It happens a lot with players
[3079.79s -> 3082.95s]  Who are very melee champ centric?
[3083.83s -> 3099.62s]  Because melee supports are actually pretty risky or they're pretty scary rather. Oh, he's totally dead. I don't remember not
[3100.12s -> 3103.88s]  But yeah, melee supports are scary to play because you have to know
[3103.88s -> 3110.36s]  know when you can get a kill by going in because you're gonna take damage, right?
[3110.36s -> 3117.05s]  That's just like the nature of melee supports.
[3117.05s -> 3118.05s]  Nice.
[3118.05s -> 3121.53s]  We're coming back in a bit, not bad.
[3121.53s -> 3124.33s]  We threw a little bit early, but yeah, we're starting to get it back.
[3124.33s -> 3127.16s]  We're chillin'.
[3127.16s -> 3129.04s]  Tarik's a never-good.
[3129.04s -> 3133.64s]  I'm always confused by Tarik because he feels like such a good champion.
[3133.64s -> 3138.04s]  The champion itself feels broken as shit.
[3138.04s -> 3150.42s]  Whenever I see Tarek, I think to myself, he's either unkillably super OP, or they're 0-1-10.
[3151.54s -> 3154.34s]  There's no in-between, right? They either know how to play Tarek or they don't.
[3154.34s -> 3155.34s]  That's what it feels like.
[3169.60s -> 3173.00s]  Oh, yeah, you're wrong. Tarek actually requires mechanics.
[3174.50s -> 3175.50s]  That's actually true.
[3176.80s -> 3179.50s]  Whereas most supports, Nautilus doesn't have mechanics, you know?
[3179.50s -> 3185.76s]  And like what's correct doesn't have mechanics. They just hit their button and if it if it works they they get a kill
[3188.06s -> 3207.65s]  Where's like Tarek after you stun there is like stuff you have to do that does make sense or block
[3208.25s -> 3211.94s]  Do you think? Oh?
[3212.00s -> 3214.00s]  I'm gonna die. Oh
[3215.06s -> 3216.24s]  Thank God
[3216.24s -> 3222.47s]  Do you think Tarek's one of the harder supports? I think he's I think he's pretty hard
[3222.47s -> 3231.55s]  Like I don't think he's, well I mean he's harder than the other supports like I think like, I don't think there's a single support that's hard.
[3232.55s -> 3236.55s]  I know I'm toxic for that but I stand by it.
[3237.55s -> 3258.32s]  Whoa. I mean I'm just gonna die. I'm not gonna try and flash.
[3259.32s -> 3266.32s]  I don't think, I should have just flashed over but I kinda got baited by the Terakult I wanted to see if I could fight but there's too much CC.
[3266.32s -> 3273.46s]  much to see I was like oh he's halting me let's go I can tell this is a really low
[3273.46s -> 3277.96s]  elo game because there's so much random deaths like I'm falling victim to like
[3277.96s -> 3281.58s]  I'm autopiloting and like I'm not thinking and I'm just talking to you
[3281.58s -> 3285.82s]  guys and I'm just dying for free but it's like there's so many people just
[3285.82s -> 3292.94s]  dying for free it's hilarious Thresh Thresh isn't actually that far so like
[3292.94s -> 3296.02s]  a lot of people think like Thresh mechanically is very difficult because
[3296.02s -> 3298.26s]  he has harder than the other supports.
[3298.26s -> 3300.06s]  But he's not actually that hard.
[3300.06s -> 3303.34s]  He's like, once you learn the Thresh combos,
[3303.34s -> 3308.34s]  he's pretty much a very upfront champion.
[3312.93s -> 3319.28s]  Yeah, like Lantern, for example,
[3319.28s -> 3322.08s]  is one of the most broken things to ever be put in League
[3322.08s -> 3324.20s]  and everybody fucks it up.
[3324.20s -> 3326.28s]  Like, people will just mess up Lantern
[3326.28s -> 3328.32s]  because they'll throw it for souls or they'll mess up.
[3328.32s -> 3331.72s]  Like, you can literally just hold Lantern perma
[3331.72s -> 3333.72s]  And your AD carry can walk up
[3334.68s -> 3339.12s]  Auto the turret and and and you literally like they literally can't play the game after that
[3345.22s -> 3348.58s]  Like the enemy team I mean because like there's nothing they can do to stop it
[3349.10s -> 3352.48s]  We can totally fight this by the way
[3353.40s -> 3356.96s]  So like I've done that before we're like my thresh. I know I have a good throw
[3356.96s -> 3358.96s]  Hold on. Let me let me win this team fight really quick
[3360.40s -> 3361.92s]  Give me a sec
[3361.92s -> 3387.62s]  Okay, cool. So I had to win that team power quick. Okay, so as I was saying
[3387.62s -> 3393.78s]  There's a lot more to Thresh than people think, right?
[3393.78s -> 3397.98s]  It's essentially, people overcomplicate what he needs to do.
[3397.98s -> 3403.18s]  So Thresh is a very basic, when you see Thresh in pro play, you don't ever see what you do,
[3403.18s -> 3408.70s]  but it's very rare that you see the sick, perma-hooking, oh my god, it's mainly like
[3408.70s -> 3410.74s]  they pick him for Lantern.
[3410.74s -> 3413.22s]  Straight up.
[3413.22s -> 3417.38s]  And when they pick Thresh in high elo, he's not picked to be the god tier, like always
[3417.38s -> 3425.98s]  landing perma CC hooks, like flay god, like he's picked to shut down engage and remove
[3425.98s -> 3427.50s]  kill threat to your carries.
[3427.50s -> 3431.40s]  That's all he's picked for.
[3431.40s -> 3435.39s]  He's literally just an EW bot.
[3435.39s -> 3436.39s]  Armor stacking?
[3436.39s -> 3439.63s]  I mean yeah, the armor thing on Thresh is nice, but I wouldn't say it's like OP on
[3439.63s -> 3440.63s]  his kit.
[3440.63s -> 3450.54s]  It just makes him like not die to 80 carries in two seconds.
[3450.54s -> 3457.42s]  this happened. But I instantly know I'm playing with a good Thresh player when I can walk up
[3457.42s -> 3476.84s]  to the turret. When I can walk up to the turret and the thre- Sorry I was trying to think and
[3476.84s -> 3480.34s]  talk at the same time. When I can walk up to the turret, my Thresh player won't walk
[3480.34s -> 3484.88s]  up and auto the turret with me. That's like the sign of a good Thresh player. When we
[3484.88s -> 3488.08s]  don't know where the enemy is and instead of walking up and trying to hit the turret
[3488.08s -> 3491.80s]  to like help you kill the turret, they'll stand in the back and literally just sit
[3491.80s -> 3500.88s]  there and wait and hold lantern until they just hold their lantern until you get ganked,
[3500.88s -> 3507.99s]  essentially. And that's why, like I said, I just personally don't think Thresh is mechanics
[3507.99s -> 3512.75s]  as hard as people think. I do think he's very knowledge-based. I think Thresh has high
[3512.75s -> 3519.11s]  knowledge caps, where if you're playing, I don't know, Lulu, your skill is basically
[3519.11s -> 3524.47s]  like, do I W, your decision-making on Lulu is literally, do I W to speed or do I W
[3524.47s -> 3528.33s]  to CC right like that's your that's your like decision-making so it's like
[3528.33s -> 3537.01s]  obviously much higher than that but it's a you son of a bitch but it's still not
[3537.01s -> 3543.01s]  like that bad I think Thresh just intimidates people because he can do
[3543.01s -> 3547.77s]  so much and so I think people just get intimidated but because they think it
[3547.77s -> 3555.44s]  looks overwhelming to learn the champ I feel like that actually intimidates a
[3555.44s -> 3560.18s]  lot of people in terms of like people not wanting to learn new champions and
[3560.18s -> 3567.50s]  shits I feel like a lot of it is just people are nervous about learning
[3567.50s -> 3574.38s]  champions that look overwhelming right like a felios for example I was talking
[3574.38s -> 3579.02s]  about this yesterday a felios is not a hard mechanical champion like he's
[3579.02s -> 3583.90s]  difficult in terms of the knowledge required like he's knowledge gated
[3583.90s -> 3589.96s]  very hard, right? So like you have to play him a decent amount or like research him to
[3589.96s -> 3594.78s]  understand what guns do what, how to interact with the guns, stuff like that, right? But
[3594.78s -> 3614.03s]  the actual mechanics of using the guns, it's actually not hard. Guys, what are we doing?
[3614.03s -> 3623.23s]  I guess we're just winning the fight. Pike? Like, like, I think Pike's harder than
[3623.23s -> 3632.02s]  Thresh. Maybe that's a hot take, but I think Pike is harder than Thresh because
[3632.02s -> 3637.36s]  Because Pyke requires really specific...
[3637.36s -> 3645.08s]  Pyke is a lot harder to play than he looks when you see people play him.
[3645.08s -> 3649.56s]  Because there's timers of when you can go in off of certain things.
[3649.56s -> 3653.92s]  Hitting his ulti consistently in teamfights is a little harder than people think.
[3653.92s -> 3659.64s]  And knowing how to position in the lane, Pyke is capable of a lot more than people think.
[3659.64s -> 3663.14s]  So I think Pyke's, I think the reason, the main reason I think Pyke's a little harder
[3663.14s -> 3669.03s]  is because he's melee.
[3669.03s -> 3674.07s]  Like melee champions are always going to be like mechanically more difficult than ranged.
[3674.07s -> 3682.10s]  If the melee champion is like, you have to engage to go in and do stuff because there's
[3682.10s -> 3690.66s]  always the counter play factor support role.
[3690.66s -> 3691.66s]  Yeah.
[3691.66s -> 3692.66s]  That's what I'm saying.
[3692.66s -> 3695.14s]  It's like, I'm not saying overall, like overall ranged champions require a lot more
[3695.14s -> 3697.06s]  mechanics than melee.
[3697.06s -> 3700.22s]  Just because you're ranged, you can die in a global and you have to space and
[3700.22s -> 3701.22s]  stuff.
[3701.22s -> 3707.06s]  I think that in just the support specific, I think melee is a lot harder to play.
[3707.06s -> 3710.56s]  That's why you see a lot of support players.
[3710.56s -> 3714.94s]  We give the best support players in the world are really good at the engage melee supports,
[3714.94s -> 3715.94s]  not the enchanters.
[3715.94s -> 3721.94s]  And that's why you see why we praise the best support players.
[3721.94s -> 3727.52s]  Because when you see somebody go in perfectly on Recon, or go in and find a way in without
[3727.52s -> 3735.26s]  getting knocked up on like I don't know something like when they find the angle on
[3735.26s -> 3751.68s]  thrash and shit it's really nice rel I think rel sucks I think that champ is so
[3751.68s -> 3763.38s]  bad because she just like she doesn't do anything like rel's rel's initial thing
[3763.38s -> 3768.42s]  was like she was supposed to go in be really tanky and then be like a stun
[3768.42s -> 3771.86s]  bot for like team fights she was a team fight monster but the problem with rel
[3771.86s -> 3777.78s]  is like she has one chance essentially in lane phase. Like if anybody has fingers on
[3777.78s -> 3783.38s]  their hands and they can move left and right, Raoul is really easy to dodge. Like it's actually
[3783.38s -> 3787.78s]  like it's incredibly easy to beat a Raoul in lane to not die to her. Like you just have
[3787.78s -> 3792.90s]  to move left and right, right? It's very simple. So it's like it's much more difficult to dodge
[3792.90s -> 3799.86s]  like other engage champs if that makes sense. Like Nautilus, you can still move left and
[3799.86s -> 3803.94s]  right, but it's like he can walk at you while it's happening. Whereas like if Raoul walks
[3803.94s -> 3810.82s]  at you, I'm still just waiting for the animation, and then I can simply move to the left.
[3810.82s -> 3817.42s]  Because her animation is so slow on using her ability that I can dash, I can flash, there's
[3817.42s -> 3819.26s]  so much counter play.
[3819.26s -> 3822.70s]  And it's like unless she flashes on you, but even then you can tell she's gonna flash
[3822.70s -> 3823.70s]  on you.
[3823.70s -> 3829.76s]  So it's like, I also feel like mid game rel has this issue where she has her one
[3829.76s -> 3832.92s]  trick ulti engage fight in teamfights.
[3832.92s -> 3837.65s]  After she does that, she does literally nothing, right?
[3837.65s -> 3841.28s]  She's like a one and done.
[3841.28s -> 3850.96s]  That's why she feels like she doesn't have other expression.
[3850.96s -> 3853.84s]  She's countered so hard by the meta too.
[3853.84s -> 3856.88s]  Milio counters Rell and Gage.
[3856.88s -> 3859.68s]  Thresh counters Rell and Gage, right?
[3859.68s -> 3863.12s]  Like either of those champions shits on Rell and Gage
[3863.12s -> 3875.96s]  and you can't do anything.
[3875.96s -> 3878.28s]  Like I don't know if you've ever tried to play Rell
[3878.28s -> 3881.32s]  gone in and been like Thresh flayed
[3881.32s -> 3884.32s]  but it's the worst feeling.
[3884.32s -> 3885.32s]  It's a bad feeling.
[3885.32s -> 3891.84s]  It's like when people play Leona, it's the same reason Leona is shit right now.
[3891.84s -> 3896.36s]  Like, they both have the same idea of why they're bad, right?
[3896.36s -> 3900.40s]  They like, have, they're both good at doing what they're supposed to do, like, you know,
[3900.40s -> 3902.80s]  stun and create pressure and point click and shit.
[3902.80s -> 3909.16s]  But the problem is, is like, you can easily counterpick them so incredibly hard that
[3909.16s -> 3910.88s]  they just become worthless the whole game.
[3910.88s -> 3916.21s]  Have you ever gotten Senna's secondary mission?
[3916.21s -> 3917.85s]  Oh, all the time.
[3917.85s -> 3926.09s]  With Senna being meta and Senna being champion I'm playing a lot I get that all the time.
[3926.09s -> 3929.33s]  You don't even notice it though I'm gonna be real.
[3929.33s -> 3932.01s]  When you kill the Thresh or whatever and you get his souls you don't even fucking notice
[3932.01s -> 3941.09s]  it cause like it's like 40 armor and it's like your level 17 or some shit at that point.
[3941.09s -> 3946.29s]  Like at the point you're getting it you're such a high level that like the 40 random
[3946.29s -> 3949.01s]  armor like it's nice but I never really notice it.
[3949.01s -> 3958.74s]  Trying to get your teammates ahead isn't that good.
[3958.74s -> 3962.66s]  You know what I've actually been doing as support on my main account?
[3962.66s -> 3975.27s]  I've actually been roaming non-stop and it's super OP.
[3975.27s -> 3982.17s]  Because the key to roaming is all you have to do to roam well is literally be there
[3982.17s -> 3987.57s]  one or two times in the first five minutes of the game to completely fuck over the
[3987.57s -> 3992.77s]  enemy one time on an engage or something and they get so far behind from it that
[3992.77s -> 4002.16s]  You can literally just walk back bot like I do on Senate like I'll push bot lane. This is this is my strategy in Senate
[4002.16s -> 4006.36s]  I'm gonna give it to you guys. Okay, so I don't know. I don't know if this works in low elo
[4006.36s -> 4009.08s]  But in like masters like high masters this works at least
[4010.52s -> 4013.80s]  This is all I do in Senate every single player I play against on Senna
[4014.48s -> 4020.80s]  Every single one except for like pike players even Nautilus Blitz they all concede lane level one every single one of them
[4020.80s -> 4025.68s]  Right, they just they just let me push level one and so I'll push the waves in level one
[4026.00s -> 4032.58s]  And I'll either crash wave 2 or wave 3 depending on how far they're giving me like push power, right?
[4032.90s -> 4037.36s]  So I will always crash wave 2 or wave 3 bot and I will immediately
[4039.04s -> 4041.04s]  roam mid
[4041.04s -> 4043.04s]  every time and
[4044.52s -> 4046.52s]  Even if I don't get a kill
[4047.08s -> 4051.98s]  Usually it fucks over the enemy mid laner so badly because on that exact timer
[4051.98s -> 4062.92s]  there's usually a gank happening on men. So a lot of the time people think that
[4062.92s -> 4067.92s]  you're roaming to get a kill for the laner. You're not. You're roaming to counter
[4067.92s -> 4074.75s]  pressure from the other players in the game. How many times have you guys been
[4074.75s -> 4078.59s]  like, oh we can win this 2v2? You see the enemy jungler? Your jungler comes,
[4078.59s -> 4081.11s]  you're like, oh we're gonna bait this and then all of a sudden the support
[4081.11s -> 4084.19s]  shows up and you're like, god damn it. And then you die and you're like,
[4084.19s -> 4086.07s]  Like what the fuck.
[4086.07s -> 4088.97s]  That right there is how easy it is to play support.
[4088.97s -> 4093.83s]  Because all you have to do is show up once, twice.
[4093.83s -> 4102.52s]  And now that entire lane is fucked for the enemy team.
[4102.52s -> 4104.04s]  Roaming is so easy.
[4104.04s -> 4108.94s]  The only thing, people fuck up roaming really bad when they roam on timers where their
[4108.94s -> 4111.44s]  adc can't safely farm.
[4111.44s -> 4116.48s]  So what ends up happening is on that timer, where like I told you wave 2, 3, right?
[4116.48s -> 4119.72s]  What happens is you push that wave and you roam mid.
[4119.72s -> 4121.12s]  Let's say nothing happens, okay?
[4121.12s -> 4123.76s]  I can just walk back bot.
[4123.76s -> 4125.26s]  You lose nothing.
[4125.26s -> 4129.56s]  And usually at that point, you have like 300 gold, so there's no point in backing, right?
[4129.56s -> 4134.24s]  Now let's say like, I noticed that my jungler is like invading topside.
[4134.24s -> 4137.72s]  I just walk over to top and help him.
[4137.72s -> 4142.60s]  Because you have like three to four, you have like three to four waves before the
[4142.60s -> 4155.96s]  The enemy bot lane has to play it almost perfectly to be able to abuse your roam on certain timers.
[4155.96s -> 4158.92s]  They essentially have to play it perfect to abuse the roam.
[4158.92s -> 4165.32s]  What I mean by that is like, the best way to abuse support roaming is you either A, if
[4165.32s -> 4171.52s]  you have the ability to dive, you can pretty much A, immediately dive, like push the
[4171.52s -> 4174.64s]  next wave, and then immediately dive, if you like have that ability, say you're
[4174.64s -> 4179.90s]  We own a draven or something but even then it's a little risky because then the ad carry can just walk back
[4179.90s -> 4185.34s]  And they only lose one wave and you gave up, you know a stack chance, so it's not that bad to
[4185.98s -> 4190.80s]  You can stack the wave now stacking the wave is the best way to counter it
[4191.42s -> 4194.12s]  Because let's say I'm roaming for an extended period
[4194.12s -> 4198.44s]  You stack like a three wave and then all of a sudden you're crashing it and my and then you want to like
[4198.44s -> 4201.48s]  You're up a level because you've been gaining XP and the ad carry has to back off
[4201.48s -> 4209.02s]  But the way to counter that is you simply just walk back on the timer of the stacked wave crashing as an AD carry or as a support
[4209.32s -> 4213.36s]  It's so incredibly easy to do. It's actually brainlessly easy to do
[4214.12s -> 4216.12s]  like all it's literally
[4216.78s -> 4222.68s]  You can roam all you want bot lane as long as you are in bot lane for the stacked wave crashes
[4222.68s -> 4231.49s]  Or you are in bot lane when your jungler is bot side of the map. It's easy as fuck
[4231.89s -> 4235.71s]  But support players drool in themselves
[4235.71s -> 4243.55s]  themselves. So they like to essentially support players like to like AFK in the lane phase.
[4243.55s -> 4249.15s]  They like to literally sit there and just do nothing. That's like the average support
[4249.15s -> 4256.54s]  I see is they will stand and do nothing. And I've said this before but I'll say it
[4256.54s -> 4260.02s]  again being a good support is not being a better player in the enemy team. Being a
[4260.02s -> 4265.78s]  good support is queuing up to play League of Legends. That's all it takes. All it
[4265.78s -> 4270.74s]  All it takes to be a good support is queuing up with the intent to push buttons in the game.
[4270.74s -> 4271.74s]  And not just AFK.
[4271.74s -> 4501.26s]  Alright, I'm back.
[4501.26s -> 4502.26s]  What's up?
[4502.26s -> 4504.78s]  I don't remember what we were talking about.
[4504.78s -> 4505.78s]  Oh, supports.
[4505.78s -> 4511.61s]  Yeah, they're all stupid.
[4511.61s -> 4513.85s]  Don't AFK on support, you'll gain LP.
[4513.85s -> 4515.41s]  It's actually that easy.
[4515.41s -> 4529.89s]  Honestly, I don't think supports are stupid.
[4529.89s -> 4531.21s]  I think it's more of a...
[4531.21s -> 4533.21s]  How do I phrase this?
[4533.21s -> 4535.21s]  In my opinion, it's more of like a
[4537.50s -> 4546.85s]  They're like they've never they don't have to learn support players like don't have to learn
[4548.13s -> 4553.09s]  Important things because they can get away with not doing it. So they get they develop bad habits. That's all it is
[4553.63s -> 4564.43s]  Do have a Spotify playlist
[4564.45s -> 4570.70s]  Yeah, best role to climb. I
[4571.78s -> 4574.42s]  Think every role is good to climb as long as you're good
[4575.14s -> 4577.14s]  Classic Jara. Oh, I don't see
[4577.42s -> 4581.38s]  Whatever you linked like I don't know how links in the chat because I had to turn them off a long time ago
[4582.34s -> 4590.36s]  So I can't see it.
[4590.36s -> 4594.04s]  I would say that climbing is just about like whatever, cause every role you can climb
[4594.04s -> 4595.04s]  on, right?
[4595.04s -> 4596.16s]  Like every single role.
[4596.16s -> 4606.14s]  So climbing a lot of the time is just about what you think is most fun for you and you
[4606.14s -> 4607.74s]  can get the best at.
[4607.74s -> 4614.34s]  I would say objectively the best roles to climb on are jungle and support for just
[4614.34s -> 4617.50s]  like higher elo.
[4617.50s -> 4621.46s]  Well jungle and lower elo support and higher elo.
[4621.46s -> 4626.36s]  I wouldn't climb on support in like gold because you're not going to have a good time trying
[4626.36s -> 4630.06s]  to like help bad players play the game.
[4630.06s -> 4631.06s]  Bad.
[4631.06s -> 4632.06s]  That's mean.
[4632.06s -> 4636.66s]  People who don't like you can get like a gold Ezreal 30 kills by being the better support
[4636.66s -> 4638.46s]  but you won't always win.
[4638.46s -> 4642.54s]  Whereas like if you really want to control solo queue and your teammates aren't like
[4642.54s -> 4647.74s]  good enough to carry at that level by themselves right like you get frustrated just pick
[4647.74s -> 4661.14s]  something that has more agency in the game. You lost 18 of 24 as jungle, you want to try
[4661.14s -> 4667.82s]  any role. I mean you could play AD, if you think it's, AD carry is interesting. I wouldn't
[4667.82s -> 4682.46s]  say it's like fun, but it's not bad. You're in gold. I mean you could try it. My view
[4682.46s -> 4685.78s]  on it is if people were wondering if they want to play a role or not, my view is just
[4685.78s -> 4688.62s]  try it, see if you like it, because if you don't like the role, you're not going
[4688.62s -> 4692.84s]  be able to put in enough games to get good at the role, right? So like, just give it a
[4692.84s -> 4696.66s]  try, see if you enjoyed it or not. And if like, it's not fun, then if it's not your
[4696.66s -> 4702.78s]  playstyle, it's not fun. Because 80s are a unique playstyle from all the other roles.
[4702.78s -> 4709.42s]  Like the reason people don't like playing AD Carry and like like watching AD Carry streamers
[4709.42s -> 4720.01s]  and shit is because AD Carry is like, it's boring. AD Carry is like zero. Like
[4720.01s -> 4724.01s]  Like, if there was a graph of shit going on when you're playing AD Carry in the game, it's like this.
[4724.01s -> 4728.01s]  That is like spikes to a hundred, and then it's back to like this, right?
[4728.01s -> 4736.02s]  It's like, AD Carry is a lot of... Every game is different.
[4736.02s -> 4739.02s]  Every game when you play AD is different.
[4739.02s -> 4745.02s]  Because you're always with a different player, like a different support unless you do OQ.
[4745.02s -> 4748.50s]  So every AD carry game's difference coupled with
[4750.02s -> 4754.02s]  You spend a lot of the game just farming but you don't get to interact with the enemy a lot
[4754.66s -> 4758.70s]  so you just kind of farm a lot of the game and even then you also like
[4760.10s -> 4764.26s]  You basically are farming for like little dopamine hits of like team fights and stuff that you get around the game
[4764.26s -> 4768.38s]  So that's kind of fun
[4768.38s -> 4771.06s]  But it's like I said, it's all you you can climb on any role
[4771.06s -> 4775.14s]  I think 80 carry requires the most mechanical skill to climb because
[4775.14s -> 4780.20s]  the difference between the climbing is like a jungler is about being in the right
[4780.20s -> 4783.82s]  spot at the right time right like you need to path this way get objectives etc
[4783.82s -> 4787.08s]  climbing is an ad carry is more about like this person fucked up their
[4787.08s -> 4819.48s]  positioning I'm gonna kill them type shit concerted queue also I want to I want
[4819.48s -> 4827.00s]  to say something if you are playing make sure and this is just a really good
[4827.00s -> 4831.04s]  standardized bit of advice make sure you're always tracking what the enemy
[4831.04s -> 4837.64s]  cooldowns are, what their spells are, stuff like that, okay?
[4837.64s -> 4841.48s]  Because playing the game is not just about farming and, you know, like your team goes
[4841.48s -> 4842.48s]  into U-Auto and shits.
[4842.48s -> 4844.08s]  Like right now, mid's Mia, right?
[4844.08s -> 4847.80s]  I can see that Varus is Mia, but it is a Varus, so like I'm not too worried about
[4847.80s -> 4850.56s]  being like level 2'd by Varus.
[4850.56s -> 4851.84s]  Not that much, right?
[4851.84s -> 4856.20s]  So I can kind of play backward because I know that it's a high chance he's not
[4856.20s -> 4857.72s]  going to run bottom level 2 as a Varus.
[4857.72s -> 4861.04s]  Now if that was like a fizz or some shit, I immediately back up.
[4861.04s -> 4865.30s]  So we notice that it's pretty obvious Rakan probably got W level 2, we don't know what it
[4865.30s -> 4866.90s]  is, but he has Q.
[4866.90s -> 4868.34s]  So he doesn't have shield.
[4868.34s -> 4878.67s]  Which means, because he doesn't have shield, it's hard for the Rakan to get back out if
[4878.67s -> 4880.87s]  he fucks up and engage.
[4880.87s -> 4882.99s]  So you need to think about these type of things, right?
[4882.99s -> 4887.87s]  Now this is wave 4, I believe, and because it's wave 4, we're gonna get level 3 on
[4887.87s -> 4888.87s]  wave 4.
[4888.87s -> 4894.35s]  You always get level 3 on wave 4 if you have full XP.
[4894.35s -> 4899.35s]  You get level 2 on wave 2, and you get level 3 on wave 4.
[4899.35s -> 4905.47s]  And these timers for when you get certain level ups, bot lane, are very important.
[4905.47s -> 4913.48s]  Now I'm going to hover over here, you see how Fiddle is right here.
[4913.48s -> 4919.80s]  I'm actually going to just walk in here and see if I can like, yeah we see him, nice.
[4919.80s -> 4922.76s]  See this is exactly what I was talking about before.
[4922.76s -> 4925.20s]  Do you see what my support is doing?
[4925.20s -> 4927.20s]  I- I left the lane.
[4928.20s -> 4933.20s]  Guys, I walked to- to like stand next to my jungler after we pushed the wave in.
[4933.70s -> 4939.20s]  My Lulu is hanging out by herself bot lane.
[4941.40s -> 4942.90s]  But she's just chilling.
[4958.79s -> 4959.79s]  You don't want to do that.
[4960.79s -> 4965.79s]  You don't ever want to be the guy who's like, by yourself bot lane as a support.
[4966.79s -> 4971.29s]  Because you don't- like supports don't need gold, right? Not really.
[4971.29s -> 4973.81s]  And you don't need farm. You don't need all that shit
[4973.81s -> 4977.69s]  So if you're ad carry roams and unless the wave is fucked and they're just being stupid
[4977.69s -> 4980.69s]  You have to fix the wave or something you don't want to be by yourself in the lane
[4981.25s -> 4988.15s]  It just doesn't do anything. How about an auto tower? Oh, uh, I used
[4989.21s -> 4994.71s]  Tilda so there's a way there's actually a setting you can have in the game where when you hit a button
[4995.33s -> 5000.53s]  It makes it so that I can't physically hit anything, but a champion. It's target
[5000.53s -> 5005.31s]  It's called target champions only and it's basically like here. I'll do it for you right now watch
[5005.31s -> 5007.97s]  You see how like I can hit the tower. You see how it's the red
[5008.81s -> 5009.85s]  sword
[5009.85s -> 5011.15s]  look
[5011.15s -> 5014.77s]  So when I hit this button, I can no longer hit the tower or the minions
[5015.93s -> 5017.93s]  But I can still hit the champions
[5019.63s -> 5025.45s]  So essentially when you're fighting in a big minion wave or you're fighting under turret you don't want to miss click
[5026.87s -> 5029.25s]  you just hit target champions only button and
[5029.25s -> 5033.77s]  And it makes it a thousand times easier because you can literally only hit the champion
[5034.17s -> 5051.25s]  It's really nice and you can make the button anything you want obviously. I just I use tilde. That's the default
[5051.25s -> 5061.50s]  I actually want to kill these guys, but I need the way for the wave to push out just the hair
[5062.58s -> 5066.70s]  The jungler could be bought but it is a fiddlestick. So it's like I don't really care about a fiddlesticks being bought
[5067.06s -> 5082.97s]  We can straight up just kill them. Okay. Well apparently we can't kill them
[5086.90s -> 5089.94s]  Because apparently my Lulu didn't want to walk up
[5089.94s -> 5099.66s]  That's so frustrating, man. I did fuck up my my auto there, but I am a little I am kind of curious what happens
[5099.66s -> 5102.62s]  I don't have to go watch the VOD. I fucked up my kill in the Zaya
[5102.62s -> 5109.50s]  I think I walked left instead or down my movement was bad like essentially when they fought right I walked like this
[5109.50s -> 5111.50s]  I should have walked like this
[5111.78s -> 5117.82s]  Because you want to cut off the Zaya from the gank now. I do think when Lulu just blindly ran away
[5117.82s -> 5119.42s]  I think she kind of grieved
[5119.42s -> 5123.98s]  You don't need to insta run from ganks, especially when like you could see what I have right I have Dirk and Sheen
[5125.48s -> 5131.14s]  Something that a lot of people do as well is they will see that like the numbers are uneven and they'll instantly run away
[5131.14s -> 5134.98s]  They don't think about like how to win the fight or like what the the win con is of the fight
[5135.32s -> 5139.74s]  Because that's what I was saying before we got ganked right I was like fiddle can't gank us and he can't pre-6
[5139.74s -> 5141.90s]  Fiddle does nothing in the gank. I had cleanse
[5142.90s -> 5145.14s]  They don't actually beat us in 3v2
[5145.14s -> 5148.72s]  So the problem was is we weren't focusing the same target
[5148.72s -> 5154.06s]  I went for the Zyra and she backed really far up now if we had played forward a bit
[5154.42s -> 5157.46s]  Like say she played a little more forward with me that would have gone a lot better
[5157.46s -> 5162.34s]  Or if I had played a little more back with her it was basically like we don't have comms so the you know
[5162.34s -> 5168.40s]  It got rough now fiddle is six now. So it's a little scary
[5168.40s -> 5173.46s]  I don't like playing versus fiddle sticks for like the reason of like 90% of the time
[5173.46s -> 5178.14s]  players don't know how to ward around fiddle. People put wards in weird spots.
[5178.14s -> 5193.12s]  We should have won that fight though. I'm a little salty. Mainly myself. So this too,
[5193.12s -> 5199.84s]  Lulu keeps speeding me up. I want to be honest with you, I don't like when
[5199.84s -> 5206.17s]  Lulu's do that. It's like a pet peeve thing of mine when Lulu's use their speed.
[5206.17s -> 5210.25s]  Like I'm okay with it if I need to dodge something or I need to chase
[5210.25s -> 5214.49s]  somebody, but I think it's just so much less value than using it to CC early game.
[5214.49s -> 5220.85s]  early game the CC of Lulu like using W is so broken to me because they just
[5220.85s -> 5225.61s]  physically can't move their character for like 1.5 seconds which is crazy I
[5225.61s -> 5240.00s]  think fiddles bot you can kind of tell you see how they're playing really
[5240.00s -> 5245.48s]  aggressive they don't beat us 2v2 so I'm thinking and they just cleared this
[5245.48s -> 5250.70s]  ward out I'm thinking fiddles is either on dragon or he's bush ganking bot
[5250.70s -> 5259.90s]  Somewhere so I don't really want to walk up you see how this guy is confidently hitting the turret
[5260.02s -> 5270.88s]  This is making me think fiddles trying to lane gank because they cannot beat us to be to like I think fiddles in here
[5271.28s -> 5275.10s]  So I'm actually just gonna play safe
[5276.38s -> 5278.38s]  Until we see him on the map, I don't know
[5279.42s -> 5290.03s]  I'm not gonna take the chance
[5290.03s -> 5291.91s]  because
[5291.91s -> 5294.67s]  You got to think about like what you see and what you don't see on the map
[5294.79s -> 5298.83s]  Like we can't physically see fiddler right but think about this. We don't see him top
[5298.83s -> 5304.41s]  That's something you have to think about we we had a ward on riff just now for 15 15 seconds, right?
[5305.31s -> 5307.31s]  We didn't see him top
[5307.63s -> 5314.38s]  So like if he's not top, where is he now? I think he finally left
[5315.12s -> 5331.38s]  This looks like he went to dragon. Yeah, what are we doing by the way? I?
[5332.58s -> 5334.42s]  Mean I guess I'm just gonna die
[5334.42s -> 5337.92s]  Now would be the time to speed me. I
[5338.60s -> 5342.74s]  Mean, I don't even know what to say about that Malzahar just didn't walk
[5342.74s -> 5354.66s]  Gragas didn't flash his E, Malzahar didn't walk. You always walk there, by the way. I want to make this clear.
[5354.66s -> 5361.66s]  If you're a mid laner and you're playing a late game scaling mid, you always walk to the fight no matter what though.
[5361.66s -> 5364.66s]  If it's at, if it's going, if it's doing that.
[5365.42s -> 5367.42s]  Okay guys
[5367.90s -> 5375.24s]  We need to walk to fights and Lulu you need to follow up when I go in don't run
[5375.74s -> 5383.17s]  I'm just gonna type it because I'm actually fucking annoyed my little frustrated
[5383.17s -> 5389.77s]  I still think the game is 100% winnable, but I'm playing Draven. We're playing like I'm playing fucking Ezreal or some shit
[5390.53s -> 5395.49s]  And I can't walk up because essentially we know fiddle was bought for the last two three minutes, right?
[5395.49s -> 5407.43s]  He just sat down there. What is my Lulu doing bro? What are you doing?
[5410.66s -> 5412.66s]  No, we fight this go
[5413.30s -> 5422.15s]  Yeah, this guy doesn't get to do this for free now. They have a gale force. So I need to be a little care
[5423.15s -> 5425.15s]  This guy has no ulti though
[5427.74s -> 5430.98s]  Like this is what I'm losing my mind man. I
[5431.82s -> 5433.58s]  do just
[5433.58s -> 5438.60s]  follow
[5438.60s -> 5442.24s]  No, what she was doing what she was trying to protect her ward
[5442.24s -> 5449.44s]  She saw the Recon hitting the Ward, but the Ziya walked up to get a Freed to just die.
[5449.44s -> 5458.76s]  The problem is, my Lulu was like, oh I don't want to give up my Ward, and she wasn't thinking.
[5458.76s -> 5462.36s]  Please, just sit with me, okay?
[5462.36s -> 5465.36s]  Yep, sorry.
[5465.36s -> 5467.88s]  I need you to follow me.
[5467.88s -> 5470.16s]  Always.
[5470.16s -> 5483.99s]  Even if it looks scary, you gotta follow, okay?
[5483.99s -> 5489.95s]  So one thing is there's actually not a lot of fighting that happens in lower elo.
[5489.95s -> 5494.99s]  So a lot of these players don't know how to fight early because one thing that I think
[5494.99s -> 5500.15s]  has gotten really bad about league lately just in the past few years is people don't
[5500.15s -> 5503.03s]  ever limit test in league ever anymore.
[5503.03s -> 5505.87s]  They always just play like pussies.
[5505.87s -> 5509.27s]  Every single player in league plays like a fucking pussy nowadays.
[5509.27s -> 5519.10s]  And it's literally just like sad to see.
[5519.10s -> 5522.28s]  Like right there, why aren't we W-ing?
[5522.28s -> 5527.28s]  Use W on the Zyah, not too speed.
[5530.69s -> 5533.21s]  Like, I'm losing my mind,
[5533.21s -> 5535.25s]  because all you have to do there is W the Zyah,
[5535.25s -> 5537.21s]  she gets CC'd, we kill her in the W.
[5538.35s -> 5541.77s]  I'm telling you, Lulu players are like hardwired
[5541.77s -> 5562.14s]  for some reason to not play correctly.
[5562.14s -> 5563.18s]  I'm never gonna catch this guy,
[5563.18s -> 5570.97s]  he's got Gale Force and Tier 2 boots.
[5570.97s -> 5572.61s]  Yeah, I mean, I have to go for it though,
[5572.61s -> 5577.73s]  if I don't go for kills now the game's over so it's either we go for it or we lose so I'm willing
[5577.73s -> 5586.56s]  to like look stupid honestly this game was my fault for the one 2v3 that happened early I misplayed
[5586.56s -> 5591.68s]  it and if I didn't misplay that we would have won the game off it now the game's pretty much over
[5593.20s -> 5598.80s]  like it's solo queue so we can always come back but the problem is uh I don't think we have
[5598.80s -> 5603.56s]  have good enough players to come back like look at what Lulu is doing Lulu why
[5603.56s -> 5622.36s]  are you bought solo at the moment think like what ah what are we doing this is
[5622.36s -> 5626.18s]  exactly what I was telling you guys doesn't make sense remember when I told
[5626.18s -> 5631.28s]  you supports easy all you have to do is be a human remember what I said that 40
[5631.28s -> 5637.12s]  second or four minutes ago before the game started all you have to do to play
[5637.12s -> 5640.96s]  support is think push buttons and be active in the game and if you can do
[5640.96s -> 5649.43s]  those things you'll get challenger on support like it blows my mind like look
[5649.43s -> 5673.61s]  what you did what are you doing this is a forfeit though I'm gonna lose my
[5673.61s -> 5693.34s]  minds auto-filled AD I'm gonna lose it my bad guess I'm an auto-filled AD I'm
[5693.34s -> 5710.51s]  just bad it's on me I apologize oh man these players are crazy I'm actually
[5710.51s -> 5716.64s]  really surprised we're just not forfeiting now the best way to play the
[5716.64s -> 5719.68s]  game is something that like I fall victim to two where I fuck this up
[5719.68s -> 5723.84s]  sometimes right but the best way to play the game a lot of the time is you
[5723.84s -> 5730.48s]  essentially don't play to take risks I know it sounds silly because you got to
[5730.48s -> 5739.70s]  find essentially you have to find the my mouths are hard just let them let
[5739.70s -> 5746.70s]  this guy this 1000 gold walk away hey mouse if you moved by the way you
[5746.70s -> 5775.86s]  You get 1k gold, mid isn't hard roll, I can mid in my sleep, it's not, ad is easiest roll.
[5775.86s -> 5789.52s]  I'm ad carry streamer, I play ad, but Lulu is small brain.
[5789.52s -> 5790.52s]  That was mean.
[5790.52s -> 5796.74s]  Lulu took some crossfire there that she didn't need to take, that was my bad.
[5796.74s -> 5797.74s]  That was toxic.
[5797.74s -> 5819.30s]  I'll be real, I think today is going to be a mute all kind of day.
[5819.30s -> 5823.92s]  Listening to low elo players talk about the game and then they think that they're right
[5823.92s -> 5827.68s]  about the game and like how it works and all this shit, it actually like hurts me.
[5827.68s -> 5832.20s]  Like it shouldn't, I should just laugh it off, but sometimes when I see a low elo player
[5832.20s -> 5836.48s]  talk about how they think the game should be played and I just know that they're wrong,
[5836.48s -> 5842.43s]  it actually like physically hurts me.
[5842.43s -> 5853.96s]  It does, it physically hurts.
[5853.96s -> 5858.08s]  But I should follow my own rule where if you're playing with people that aren't
[5858.08s -> 5863.36s]  is good like they don't see what you see right there's like something where it's better to
[5863.36s -> 5869.36s]  play safe and scale even on Draven it's better to play safe and scale than to go for plays in lane
[5873.04s -> 5874.08s]  mainly because
[5876.40s -> 5881.28s]  if you go for plays in lane and let's say your support is not as good as you
[5881.28s -> 5885.84s]  or your support's not confident in their ability to 2v2 right then you're just gonna lose
[5885.84s -> 5889.68s]  So you're like forcing that person to be in an uncomfortable situation.
[5889.68s -> 5896.32s]  So like it's hard for me as a player to just play safe when I see the enemy making mistake after
[5896.32s -> 5901.92s]  mistake. It's like something that I have trouble like personally working on right just like a personal
[5901.92s -> 5906.80s]  issue where like I'll see an enemy make a mistake positional wise and I'm like oh shit let's abuse
[5906.80s -> 5912.08s]  this. But a lot of the time the problem that happens is you have somebody who doesn't know
[5912.08s -> 5915.60s]  that that person made a mistake or doesn't see the same mistake as me and because there's
[5915.60s -> 5920.00s]  no comms I can't relate to them that we should fight right so if I go in and they don't know
[5920.00s -> 5928.16s]  that we should be fighting there I end up dying and it looks it feels really bad which is
[5928.16s -> 5933.52s]  I mean my fault it's like a personal thing because you can't control your supports you
[5933.52s -> 5942.25s]  can only control yourself it's just something that like I suck at doing sometimes right
[5942.25s -> 5968.22s]  So that's just on me we could actually kill the Zyra now by the way. She's like 60% HP
[5968.98s -> 5995.65s]  Like we could kill her. What is my Gragas doing?
[5997.43s -> 6006.84s]  Oh, he got her though nice bro use W
[6008.28s -> 6010.28s]  You see see people
[6011.08s -> 6020.50s]  Not to speed people that was a good example to oh well
[6020.50s -> 6029.96s]  I just got to get better at doing that where I play safe though. That's on me
[6029.96s -> 6063.36s]  That's just a personal thing I got to get better at. Oh, man. I think we're warmed up though. What 80 carry do you guys want to see next game?
[6064.56s -> 6066.56s]  That was that was a brutal ass game
[6067.40s -> 6069.64s]  I'm gonna be real. That was a brutal ass game
[6071.04s -> 6074.40s]  What 80 carry streamer do you guys want to see or 80 care stream what 80 carry?
[6076.56s -> 6086.30s]  Champion do you guys want to see this game? I just goofed up and tried to play too aggressive with a player that wasn't willing to play aggressive
[6086.30s -> 6088.30s]  That was on me
[6088.30s -> 6121.82s]  That's my bed. I'll play better. This guy goes Psyon. Oh, never change. Twitch chat never change.
[6121.82s -> 6145.69s]  Well, the thing is, I have to change my mindset. So like the thing, okay, let me explain something
[6145.69s -> 6150.01s]  just like a personal thing with me. I'm very, very, very good mechanically at this game,
[6150.01s -> 6154.73s]  right? Like it's my best trade is like I have very good mechanics. So, and I also have like
[6154.73s -> 6162.41s]  autistic weird brain where I can see I have really good pattern recognition so
[6162.41s -> 6166.97s]  when I see that the enemy is fucking up I know that I'm pretty much always going
[6166.97s -> 6174.29s]  to be better at the 2v2 okay so because I know that I'm always gonna be better
[6174.29s -> 6180.89s]  at the 2v2 I always want to take the fight when I see that they make a
[6180.89s -> 6187.21s]  mistake like they miss a skill shot or they walk up too far or stuff like that right but the problem is
[6187.21s -> 6191.85s]  when you're bought in you have to work with a teammate and that's part of just playing ad carry
[6191.85s -> 6197.77s]  right and if you're in solo queue you can't always do it so you have to I have to like train myself
[6199.13s -> 6205.61s]  to just be okay with them making mistakes and us not abusing those mistakes it's very
[6205.61s -> 6209.29s]  frustrating for me personally because i'm a perfectionist so it's very frustrating for
[6209.29s -> 6212.01s]  for me to like see this happening and I'm like oh I want to abuse this because I know
[6212.01s -> 6217.29s]  we can but we have to like I have to like tell myself not to and to just like not fuck
[6217.29s -> 6221.41s]  up the wave state not take bad trades and shit because every time there's there's more to
[6221.41s -> 6225.65s]  it too so if like I walk up and I take a fight right let's say like when Rakan w'd in when
[6225.65s -> 6232.09s]  the fiddle gang for example right uh if I take that fight I'm now banking that fight
[6232.09s -> 6236.37s]  on Lulu also playing correctly right like they they missed all their abilities and
[6236.37s -> 6243.65s]  fucked up but I also messed like you nobody can play perfectly every game
[6243.65s -> 6246.99s]  like I can't teammates can't nobody can it's league and we're all humans right
[6246.99s -> 6250.41s]  so you have to bank when you're doing that on like your teammate being able
[6250.41s -> 6254.73s]  to know what you want to accomplish in that moment in solo queue with no comms
[6254.73s -> 6258.21s]  and it's really hard like it's a really bad mindset that I have
[6258.21s -> 6265.23s]  sometimes but it's hard to get over because like I like the landing phase
[6265.23s -> 6271.97s]  for me is the most fun part of the game. I love landing phase because in my opinion landing phase
[6271.97s -> 6276.85s]  is like a little mini chess game between the enemy ball and right it's like a it's like a chess
[6276.85s -> 6283.49s]  game with like mechanics where it's like how how well can like I auto space them right can I can I
[6283.49s -> 6289.09s]  space them well can I space them like can I by spacing I mean can I walk into them trade and not
[6289.09s -> 6293.65s]  take damage back right and I'm always thinking to myself like okay can I do that I can and
[6293.65s -> 6295.37s]  And then I'm like, I want to do this, right?
[6295.37s -> 6296.97s]  And then I'll get somebody to half,
[6296.97s -> 6299.57s]  and then they'll panic and they'll engage on me.
[6299.57s -> 6301.85s]  And the problem is though, is like I said,
[6301.85s -> 6305.35s]  without comms or without people who are recognizing
[6305.35s -> 6307.13s]  what you're trying to accomplish,
[6307.13s -> 6311.83s]  sometimes supports and junglers, people get flustered
[6311.83s -> 6313.37s]  and it will go badly.
[6313.37s -> 6314.81s]  And it's my fault at the end of the day
[6314.81s -> 6316.85s]  because I'm choosing to that playstyle
[6316.85s -> 6318.81s]  of relying on my teammates
[6318.81s -> 6321.41s]  instead of knowing that I can probably outscale
[6321.41s -> 6325.25s]  and play better late game and just like keep good CS and not die and shit.
[6325.25s -> 6328.17s]  Which is what you guys should all do.
[6328.17s -> 6330.93s]  And that's what I tell people to do when they ask me how to play AD.
[6330.93s -> 6334.57s]  I tell you like don't die, scale up, get items.
[6334.57s -> 6338.01s]  But like because I've played the game for so long and my favorite part of the game
[6338.01s -> 6343.37s]  is lane phase and like winning lane and playing that little chess game.
[6343.37s -> 6348.81s]  I fuck myself over in a lot of games because I'll like you know force fights that
[6348.81s -> 6354.29s]  Like my teammate would have to play well in as well to win and I'll make a mistake or they'll make a mistake
[6354.29s -> 6357.97s]  And we'll just lose the game off it and it's not a good play style
[6359.61s -> 6361.61s]  Right it's not a good play style
[6362.25s -> 6368.59s]  That's just like something that like I know other people probably also have and I'm telling you that like if you want to
[6368.59s -> 6371.57s]  climb you got to get out of that mindset and get into the mindset of like
[6373.01s -> 6380.27s]  Consistency because you can see last game for example. I just straight up like
[6380.95s -> 6387.27s]  lost the game off of me trying to fight when my support didn't know how to fight or want to fight
[6387.91s -> 6395.45s]  and we lost the game off it. Like I was too aggro and even though if they did play correctly we
[6395.45s -> 6402.09s]  win they didn't so we lost. So it's basically like it's just not like a good uh it's not a good uh
[6402.97s -> 6415.42s]  what's the word I'm looking for strategy because last game was my fault because I'm
[6415.42s -> 6419.60s]  good enough at the game that I know that I can't play like that if I want to be
[6419.60s -> 6428.10s]  consistent and I still play like it so it's my bad I what are we playing this
[6428.10s -> 6433.54s]  game boys we got Rengar karma Jin what do people want to see let me see if any
[6433.54s -> 6437.98s]  of the 80 carries people want to see if I could play these I can't play vain
[6437.98s -> 6441.16s]  into this the vain would be way too hard in the karma Jin I would just get
[6441.16s -> 6454.68s]  zoned off the wave I could play a fellios this is actually a good a
[6454.68s -> 6461.20s]  You know what kind of sucks?
[6461.20s -> 6466.56s]  I feel kind of bad playing Aphelios when I'm on my teaching accounts.
[6466.56s -> 6468.48s]  Like this account I teach you guys.
[6468.48s -> 6474.92s]  I feel bad playing Aphelios sometimes because I know a lot of people don't want to learn
[6474.92s -> 6484.16s]  Aphelios or play Aphelios because he is like really, he's very unique.
[6484.16s -> 6486.64s]  He's hard to learn for a lot of people.
[6486.64s -> 6488.64s]  I feel I always feel kind of bad doing it
[6489.36s -> 6491.04s]  Right
[6491.04s -> 6495.88s]  But I'll be real. I don't know in this specific situation outside of like Jinx. I
[6497.16s -> 6499.16s]  Didn't really know what else to pick
[6499.92s -> 6513.52s]  Like Jinx is good Kaisa's probably okay, but you still get zoned off the wave on Kaisa because like if we if we look at this, right?
[6517.37s -> 6522.97s]  Kaisa would have been I guess okay, but when you're picking a champion for bot lane, right?
[6522.97s -> 6527.77s]  When you're picking a champion for bot lane, one thing that you guys should think about
[6527.77s -> 6531.61s]  when picking what champion you want to play, unless you're a one-trick and then play whatever
[6531.61s -> 6536.41s]  you want, but if you're somebody who wants to actually play the meta and learn why champions
[6536.41s -> 6542.66s]  are meta and when to pick what, they picked Jhin Karma.
[6542.66s -> 6545.24s]  Now, we have a Lulu.
[6545.24s -> 6550.54s]  If we had something with a hook, like a Nautilus, a Blitz, a Thresh, a Pike, like
[6550.54s -> 6554.82s]  if we had something like that, I could pick a low-range fighter, right?
[6554.82s -> 6559.06s]  I could pick a low-range fighter if we had a hook champ, but because we don't have a
[6559.06s -> 6564.60s]  hook champ and we have an enchanter, I have to pick something that can safely, consistently
[6564.60s -> 6567.90s]  farm and not get zoned off by their bot lane.
[6567.90s -> 6570.78s]  So there's not a lot of options that can do that.
[6570.78s -> 6574.60s]  There's like, I didn't want to pick, you could pick Ezreal here, it's not the worst,
[6574.60s -> 6578.22s]  but we had a Lulu, so I didn't want to pick Ezreal because Lulu goes to waste.
[6578.22s -> 6580.62s]  So it's like you could pick Jinx, but I kind of didn't want to pick Jinx this
[6580.62s -> 6583.50s]  game because Jinx bores the shit out of me right now.
[6583.50s -> 6587.66s]  So this would be a good jinx game though, if you guys are curious, like this would be
[6587.66s -> 6589.46s]  a completely fine jinx game.
[6589.46s -> 6596.02s]  Your E stops Rengar jump, you can follow up really easily with Lulu, like this would
[6596.02s -> 6600.34s]  be a good jinx game.
[6600.34s -> 6602.02s]  But it's a good Ophelia's game too, it's both.
[6602.02s -> 6605.34s]  It's a good Ophelia's game, good jinx game.
[6605.34s -> 6610.58s]  It could be a good Zerri game, Zerri wouldn't be that bad here with Lulu and against
[6610.58s -> 6613.06s]  their comp, they're already squishy.
[6613.06s -> 6616.86s]  She's really mobile, can get away from Ringer ganks pretty easily.
[6616.86s -> 6623.70s]  Tristana, okay so Trist is unique because you only pick Tristana if you plan on winning
[6623.70s -> 6624.70s]  lane.
[6624.70s -> 6625.70s]  Okay?
[6625.70s -> 6631.02s]  Tristana doesn't actually scale better than Jynx in any way.
[6631.02s -> 6635.74s]  Like she does not have a better scaling than Jynx.
[6635.74s -> 6641.58s]  Trist vs Jynx three items, Jynx wins every time in teamfights no matter what.
[6641.58s -> 6645.30s]  She just does what Trist does better.
[6645.30s -> 6648.78s]  Now the reason you pick Trist is because you do want to win lane, you want to like jump
[6648.78s -> 6650.98s]  in, you want to kill them, you want to be aggressive, right?
[6650.98s -> 6654.22s]  So that's what you're picking Trist for, is that you get kills in lane.
[6654.22s -> 6656.90s]  The problem is, again, what we were just talking about, right?
[6656.90s -> 6659.14s]  Let's say I picked Trist to get kills in lane.
[6659.14s -> 6663.46s]  Now let's say my support doesn't want to be aggressive.
[6663.46s -> 6667.86s]  And let's say like the Jhin and the Karma have a really good push, okay?
[6667.86s -> 6672.60s]  that Trist is really weak at is being pushed in, right? That's one of her weakest things
[6672.60s -> 6676.90s]  because she struggles, especially early game, she struggles quite a bit on farming under
[6676.90s -> 6682.18s]  turret. So, let's say it's just like a coin-flippy
[6682.18s -> 6688.54s]  pick. You could pick Trist if you had like a support duo, for sure, into Gen. Trist
[6688.54s -> 6693.38s]  is amazing into Gen. It's one of Gen's hardest actual counters. But again, it's not
[6693.38s -> 6696.50s]  about countering the champion, it's about countering the lane and what the lane is
[6696.50s -> 6699.70s]  is going to do to you and being able to play around that.
[6699.70s -> 6701.58s]  And this lane is a shove lane.
[6701.58s -> 6703.14s]  Jhin, Karma doesn't fight you.
[6703.14s -> 6705.02s]  They poke you and shove waves in.
[6705.02s -> 6705.86s]  That's what they do.
[6705.86s -> 6706.94s]  They're a prior lane.
[6706.94s -> 6709.22s]  So they're just gonna shove and shove and shove, right?
[6709.22s -> 6711.46s]  So because they're just gonna shove and shove and shove,
[6711.46s -> 6713.78s]  I need to play something that isn't gonna have issues
[6713.78s -> 6715.58s]  playing under turret or something that can shove back
[6715.58s -> 6717.70s]  if I need to, right?
[6717.70s -> 6724.16s]  Which is why Jinx and Afaleos are both good.
[6724.16s -> 6725.96s]  Ezreal again would just get shoved in,
[6725.96s -> 6726.80s]  stuff like that, right?
[6726.80s -> 6728.28s]  These are things you actually have to think about
[6728.28s -> 6735.62s]  you're playing the game for certain champions in certain matchups because a lot of the time
[6735.62s -> 6739.64s]  people will pick a champion that's meta and they won't understand why they're still losing
[6739.64s -> 6743.48s]  the matchup even though they're good at that champion and it's just that you're not bad
[6743.48s -> 6746.44s]  at the champ, the matchup is just unplayable.
[6746.44s -> 6751.52s]  You could put faker, doublelift, fucking goomyosse in certain matchups and they
[6751.52s -> 6752.52s]  will just lose.
[6752.52s -> 6757.00s]  They will lose the matchups and it's because no matter how good your mechanics are,
[6757.00s -> 6761.50s]  If the matchup is played correctly, it doesn't- it's not winnable.
[6761.50s -> 6763.94s]  And that's why you see in pro play, drafting is so important.
[6763.94s -> 6767.28s]  It's a perfect example of why in pro play, drafting is 10 times more important than solo
[6767.28s -> 6768.28s]  queue.
[6768.28s -> 6773.17s]  And it's because when everybody plays the matchups correctly and shit, right?
[6773.17s -> 6778.13s]  When everybody's playing the matchups correctly and shits, the matchup, like, skill becomes
[6778.13s -> 6780.89s]  a thousand times more important.
[6780.89s -> 6784.69s]  Or like, you know, how the matchups being played- like, the champions become way
[6784.69s -> 6785.69s]  more important.
[6785.69s -> 6788.37s]  Whoa, what the fuck?
[6788.37s -> 6790.37s]  I'm on it there just fucked up. What the hell is going on?
[6794.57s -> 6798.73s]  Another little tip for you guys. Oh, I fucked up, but another little tip for you guys is
[6801.53s -> 6804.53s]  melee champions or melee minions take
[6810.76s -> 6817.75s]  One turret shot two autos or sorry two turrets shots one auto and casters take one auto one turret shot
[6819.37s -> 6821.89s]  When you're under turrets like luck, okay, so
[6823.13s -> 6826.89s]  Learning this will be actually a pretty game to explain to you how to farm under the turret actually I
[6827.45s -> 6830.81s]  Was thinking about like what I could teach you guys because we're just gonna get shoved in a lot this game
[6830.81s -> 6842.68s]  It's actually not that bad though, so right now we could actually space forward here
[6843.88s -> 6846.38s]  Okay, that did not hit me. That was BS, but sure I
[6856.57s -> 6859.37s]  Did the same thing I did last game man. I
[6860.69s -> 6862.85s]  Did the same thing you said I walked up
[6863.89s -> 6867.05s]  It wasn't it was a good fight, but again I
[6867.65s -> 6872.19s]  Keep doing that or like I see the fight and I'll take the fight because I know it's a good fight
[6872.19s -> 6879.22s]  but Lulu was too far back so I ended up just inting. It's really stupid.
[6879.22s -> 6899.06s]  Like it was such a dumb play by me because I had to blow both my sums right
[6899.06s -> 6903.84s]  there because the Jhin or I mean the Jhin was in a really bad spot and the
[6903.84s -> 6906.58s]  Karma was in a really bad spot because I was level 3 and they were level 2 and
[6906.58s -> 6912.10s]  they were walking up to contest waves but my Lulu was behind me and when
[6912.10s -> 6916.26s]  you're playing you know solo queue you have to play as a team with your
[6916.26s -> 6918.86s]  teammate okay so this jinn is kind of
[6918.86s -> 6926.82s]  griefing right now he's griefing by like
[6926.82s -> 6929.26s]  walking up when I'm blue gunning him I
[6929.26s -> 6936.26s]  don't know what Lulu's doing I'm just
[6936.26s -> 6937.74s]  killing that guy nice yeah they're
[6937.74s -> 6939.06s]  they're griefing really hard so the blue
[6939.06s -> 6941.94s]  guns OP for what you just saw all you
[6941.94s -> 6943.14s]  have to do with the blue gun if you
[6943.14s -> 6944.26s]  really want to just like have a funny
[6944.26s -> 6947.62s]  ass overpowered fucking when they're
[6947.62s -> 6950.10s]  farming under the turret like that just
[6950.10s -> 6958.55s]  hit the minions okay we're getting
[6958.55s -> 6973.50s]  ganks. Let's back up. So I kind of did a cardinal sin there I would say like a sin of like I overstayed a bit I think.
[6975.26s -> 6987.78s]  Oh okay well fuck off dude. That was greedy. I should have backed out the turret but I didn't think Karma was actually gonna do that but I did overstay because you can see like this is the perfect example of why I overstayed. So they stopped my back right.
[6987.78s -> 6991.48s]  I can give you guys a really good example of what just happened. I
[6992.66s -> 6998.22s]  Overstate and when I overstayed I didn't actually get anything out of it like I got what you saw
[6998.22s -> 6999.62s]  I just have extra gold for nothing
[6999.62s -> 7005.98s]  So now I just have extra gold right and because I have extra gold the gin actually gets in that positive because they stopped my back
[7006.10s -> 7010.26s]  So he gets a free plate here. I miss a cannon and even though I'm still up 10 CS
[7010.78s -> 7014.80s]  It's like I could have been up 10 CS not given a plate and not
[7014.80s -> 7023.34s]  missed a cannon so it's it's basically like it's interesting should you get
[7023.34s -> 7030.76s]  prior for your jungler every game no no that's not important some games prior
[7030.76s -> 7035.16s]  was important it's very important some games but you don't need to always be
[7035.16s -> 7038.72s]  thinking about getting prior for your jungler that's not something you should
[7038.72s -> 7041.48s]  be like thinking about like always right like you think about it in terms
[7041.48s -> 7046.04s]  of like timers that's important but prior for jungler always is not like
[7046.04s -> 7056.06s]  something you should be worrying about because if you're perma shoving and
[7056.06s -> 7058.74s]  you're like oh I have prior for my jungler but then your jungler doesn't do
[7058.74s -> 7062.70s]  anything like having that prior would if you don't have pride it doesn't do
[7062.70s -> 7070.59s]  anything like I'd rather hold the wave in like a certain spot oh my god I suck
[7070.59s -> 7108.38s]  I mean it worked out I think if I was six I triple killed them there but I
[7108.38s -> 7114.00s]  I think we actually almost I think we actually triple kill them too if Lulu helps me, but again
[7114.78s -> 7167.69s]  You guys know what I'm gonna say. I go back to the thing. I don't know if Rengar has ulti or not. I want to shove this because
[7175.19s -> 7186.67s]  Chill I want to shove it in for a second, and I really don't have anything to do so I'll just stand here
[7186.79s -> 7188.95s]  You want to also be back backed
[7189.77s -> 7193.99s]  Once it's hit for winded by boots. I bought boots. I felt like I was you can buy boots really early
[7193.99s -> 7200.81s]  He's like he's a champion where the more attacks you do is actually very valuable and positioning on a fellow. This is very important
[7201.07s -> 7202.87s]  it's kind of like
[7202.87s -> 7207.45s]  Some AD carries like you don't need boots really early like like with like Jinx for example
[7207.45s -> 7213.99s]  I usually go free boots right or I go boots like after my Kraken, but with a fellow's I
[7215.07s -> 7217.87s]  Really like the early mobility the early trading
[7218.47s -> 7227.97s]  Stuff like that. Okay, so always be watching the map to we see the Rengar's top, right?
[7228.31s -> 7230.97s]  We can actually just straight fight these guys 2v2 right now
[7232.97s -> 7242.63s]  What wait what what's my Lulu doing homie?
[7243.39s -> 7245.73s]  What what are we he's alting us?
[7256.73s -> 7258.73s]  So you're saying
[7258.87s -> 7271.74s]  Helping the 80 carry is bad got it. I can't believe my Lulu just walked away from me and
[7272.50s -> 7275.70s]  Just like watched like you work as a team
[7275.70s -> 7286.19s]  This is something that I cannot stress enough. Play as a team when you play League of Legends.
[7286.19s -> 7291.87s]  This tilts me more than anything because this happens even in Grandmaster. I see teammates
[7291.87s -> 7299.75s]  who will be selfish and not help each other. Just help each other. Help each other please man.
[7299.75s -> 7311.29s]  we are a team. Don't just run and leave your ADC. Like I'm not even flaming you but like
[7311.29s -> 7319.45s]  dude you can't do that. You can't be upset that like I can't dodge every spell. I feel
[7319.45s -> 7324.13s]  like something that I noticed that happens a lot in League now is players will have this
[7324.13s -> 7331.37s]  weirdly high expectation for everyone to play absolutely perfect at all times. And they
[7331.37s -> 7333.97s]  They want me to like, be Gumiase.
[7333.97s -> 7337.41s]  And I'm like, dude, I dodged two of the gin bullets.
[7337.41s -> 7338.79s]  I dodged a karma cue.
[7339.89s -> 7341.29s]  Like, you literally, like,
[7341.29s -> 7343.41s]  I can't dodge literally everything while slowed, right?
[7343.41s -> 7353.02s]  Like, that's not how it works.
[7353.02s -> 7355.84s]  Like, dude, I'm gonna lose my mind with this guy.
[7385.35s -> 7392.41s]  My Lulu is blaming me.
[7392.41s -> 7395.32s]  It's okay.
[7395.32s -> 7396.32s]  It's okay.
[7396.32s -> 7397.84s]  I don't need to be upset.
[7398.72s -> 7399.56s]  It's fine.
[7400.44s -> 7401.60s]  The Lulu player,
[7402.84s -> 7411.14s]  It's totally okay, you know sometimes people think they're right
[7412.26s -> 7413.86s]  It's just
[7413.86s -> 7415.70s]  what happens
[7415.70s -> 7424.09s]  in the worlds
[7424.09s -> 7426.01s]  Right, it's just
[7426.01s -> 7427.61s]  It is what it is
[7427.61s -> 7442.10s]  No big deal
[7442.10s -> 7447.38s]  Sorry, I'm trying really hard to not be an asshole right now. This lulu player is making me like
[7448.42s -> 7452.10s]  Making me want to like fund Thanos. You know what I mean? Like this guy is like making me
[7453.54s -> 7455.54s]  Like this guy like we talk about
[7455.54s -> 7458.88s]  We like in league we talk about like the players
[7459.70s -> 7462.30s]  Like we talk about ad carry players having ego. I
[7463.58s -> 7465.46s]  genuinely think
[7465.46s -> 7471.34s]  Support players have five times the ego ad carry players have but with like a third of the skill
[7471.34s -> 7477.72s]  I think ad carry players do have massive egos
[7478.50s -> 7487.62s]  But again, I don't think that like I think support players are genuinely the dumbest motherfucking humans on the planet
[7487.62s -> 7492.82s]  And they think that they're the best players to ever touch the game and it hurts my fucking balls
[7493.54s -> 7516.82s]  Hey, Lulu
[7516.90s -> 7518.90s]  Would you be willing
[7518.98s -> 7520.98s]  to have a
[7521.26s -> 7523.26s]  Vod review
[7523.34s -> 7525.90s]  With me in discord after the game
[7526.82s -> 7529.98s]  Let's just see I want to see if like this person is willing to listen to reason
[7531.86s -> 7559.13s]  Let's see I'm trying to not tilt but it's really frustrating
[7559.13s -> 7567.69s]  because this player is playing specifically for KDA and they're playing like they don't understand
[7567.69s -> 7573.37s]  how like I can already tell you if I go look at this person's OP.GG they only play for KDA I can
[7573.37s -> 7580.57s]  tell you right now right here this person plays only for KDA never takes any risks doesn't ever
[7580.57s -> 7585.77s]  help their AD carry ever when they get behind doesn't ever walk up to like try and fight doesn't
[7585.77s -> 7589.43s]  do any of that. I can tell you right now without even looking at their OP.GG from how
[7589.43s -> 7599.00s]  this person plays that they have high KDAs but really low win rate. But I don't want
[7599.00s -> 7601.88s]  my entire stream to be bitching about this Lulu so we'll try and focus on how to win
[7601.88s -> 7606.24s]  from this position. So I'm sure you guys get shitty supports too. So we'll try and
[7606.24s -> 7621.19s]  focus on how to win from the current position we're in. Yeah it doesn't get better.
[7621.19s -> 7626.59s]  I mean I'll be honest with you my Grandmaster supports on my main suck. Like it doesn't
[7626.59s -> 7632.23s]  get better they get better like mechanically at the game right like the higher elo supports
[7632.23s -> 7637.99s]  get better mechanically but they get work they don't get better when like it doesn't
[7637.99s -> 7640.99s]  get better it's always like you'll either have a really good support or you have somebody
[7640.99s -> 7678.94s]  who sniffs glue I'm just dead or I'm not dead honestly our biggest issue here is I need
[7678.94s -> 7693.04s]  to get bloodthirster ASAP once I get BT the game gets a lot easier we could kill
[7693.04s -> 7696.92s]  kill this guy right now. If the Lulu helps me we can actually just straight kill these
[7696.92s -> 7702.76s]  guys because I can ulti to heal myself right? We have Lulu ult, I have ult to heal myself
[7702.76s -> 7710.76s]  and I'm strong. She has ignite, I have ult, I have everything. We could easily kill that
[7710.76s -> 7723.24s]  Taliyah right there. I mean yeah, whatever man. This is what I'm talking about. Again,
[7723.24s -> 7727.88s]  Are you willing to get into Discord and Vod review?
[7727.88s -> 7737.04s]  Yes or no?
[7737.04s -> 7741.24s]  I mean, I have to be honest with you.
[7741.24s -> 7742.96s]  The reason this is frustrating is because,
[7742.96s -> 7744.52s]  as an AD carry player,
[7744.52s -> 7747.88s]  you want to be able to rely on your support, right?
[7747.88s -> 7750.08s]  You want to be able to make plays, go in,
[7750.08s -> 7751.50s]  fight and rely on your teammates.
[7751.50s -> 7753.20s]  Because as an AD carry player,
[7753.20s -> 7754.76s]  you support an AD or like a duo, right?
[7754.76s -> 7756.24s]  Like you wanna play together.
[7757.56s -> 7759.88s]  No, no man, I'm not attacking you.
[7759.88s -> 7768.42s]  I'm saying let's discord after you can explain your POV and I'll explain mine
[7775.50s -> 7777.50s]  Maybe we can like improve this player
[7778.34s -> 7782.10s]  Like get them to be a better player and not ruin every game they play in
[7782.58s -> 7786.02s]  Like that would be that would be the goat
[7790.72s -> 7805.80s]  Like the app that did not hit me by the way that hip-hop should be yes, but I don't even understand. Oh
[7810.20s -> 7811.36s]  man
[7811.36s -> 7818.64s]  This is the person's
[7818.64s -> 7824.21s]  By the way, this is the person's op.gg.
[7824.21s -> 7832.25s]  Average win rate, 50% win rate, like I said, has really good KDAs on all his champs, but
[7832.25s -> 7834.69s]  he doesn't win.
[7834.69s -> 7840.59s]  I'm telling you right now, the biggest thing in League, the fAKEST thing in League of
[7840.59s -> 7846.57s]  Legends is believing that you are a good player based on KDA.
[7846.57s -> 7851.49s]  If I go look at any challenger level support player right now, their KDAs will be like
[7852.25s -> 7854.17s]  Four
[7854.17s -> 7857.89s]  They'll still have good KDA, but it'll be like four and three and it'll be on
[7859.29s -> 7860.97s]  That's your mutual
[7860.97s -> 7862.97s]  I'm gonna be real what you ran out to you
[7863.69s -> 7865.61s]  this Lulu player
[7865.61s -> 7868.25s]  Like I you could tell me that this person
[7868.85s -> 7872.85s]  Sniffed glue as a kid and their parents never told them to stop and I would believe you
[7873.65s -> 7876.13s]  I'm not even meaning like I would say that makes sense. I
[7877.37s -> 7880.43s]  Mean I said don't I don't even care. I don't care if it's a girl a guy
[7880.43s -> 7886.27s]  The e-girl thing is like that doesn't bother me right like it could be a girl a guy a pigeon they could they could fucking
[7886.75s -> 7888.03s]  They could
[7888.03s -> 7892.99s]  Relate as a fucking peanut in a in a fucking plane. I don't care about that at all
[7893.35s -> 7898.09s]  You know I mean like so that shit doesn't bother me at all
[7899.21s -> 7903.85s]  Like then be like I actually think it's stupid when people are like oh, it's an e-girl e-guy like I
[7904.33s -> 7906.09s]  Think that's dumb as shit
[7906.09s -> 7908.17s]  Because that argument so crap
[7908.17s -> 7911.73s]  Because like I don't give a shit if it's a guy or girl because like you know what I mean
[7911.73s -> 7914.85s]  I'm more upset at the fact that this person is delusional than anything
[7915.85s -> 7917.69s]  That's like what's tilting me
[7917.69s -> 7930.28s]  Here I'm just gonna mute
[7930.56s -> 7935.72s]  We'll do one more game on this account after this game, and I'm gonna mute from the start of the game for you guys, okay?
[7942.34s -> 7945.26s]  Dude if he didn't actually get me into the wall there
[7945.26s -> 7949.54s]  I tried to walk forward so that I wouldn't get condemned in the wall if he didn't stun me I kill him
[7950.38s -> 7952.38s]  That's annoying
[7952.62s -> 7956.06s]  That was actually such a good hitbox for him my bad
[7970.31s -> 7972.31s]  Nice huge shut down nice job
[7972.59s -> 7975.67s]  If you're wondering why I'm even here by the way, I'm actually I'm not trolling
[7975.87s -> 7981.47s]  I'm trying to get this turret because this gives me a lot of gold at the moment. I'm not actually worth that much gold
[7981.75s -> 7984.75s]  There's nothing going on on the map. There's no objective or anything like that, right?
[7984.83s -> 7987.79s]  So I'm trying to push in top waves right now so that I can get gold
[7989.27s -> 7992.47s]  To try and like hyper inflate my two item before this next dragon
[7993.03s -> 7997.19s]  Because this next dragon is gonna be incredibly important if we if we want any chance to win
[7997.19s -> 8003.91s]  We have to win that this next dragon and the only way for me to do that is to either get really lucky or
[8005.19s -> 8007.19s]  Go get some gold in a sidewind
[8007.55s -> 8012.03s]  It's just support difference every game. It is I want to point this out
[8012.19s -> 8018.33s]  This person is playing this victim complex bullshit like you know what I mean, but it is it is actually support death
[8019.07s -> 8057.23s]  Sorry, I'm tilted. I'm playing bad this game. I
[8058.71s -> 8061.71s]  Need to mute these players because these players are actually tilting me
[8063.19s -> 8066.87s]  Like I was fine with it before but I'm actually getting a little irritated that's made me play bad
[8067.69s -> 8069.99s]  So I need to mute them so I don't keep inting
[8072.13s -> 8074.85s]  Like it's affecting my gameplay and it's pissing me off
[8076.93s -> 8085.75s]  That's just my bad
[8085.75s -> 8087.75s]  T split are you here T?
[8088.59s -> 8090.83s]  Yo T message this Lulu. I
[8091.51s -> 8097.47s]  Mean this in the nicest way. I don't even want to be toxic. I genuinely want to use this for content
[8100.85s -> 8102.85s]  Like this guy's been flaming me the whole game
[8103.17s -> 8109.33s]  Like I want to use this for content to show you guys that it is so easy to tell people how the game should be played
[8109.97s -> 8113.23s]  So easy if you if you can communicate by talking
[8116.75s -> 8121.95s]  Because this guy's been doing nothing but flaming me the entire game this little right, but he's an absolute
[8122.59s -> 8127.51s]  Like he played the lane completely bad then he then he stopped trying to win
[8128.27s -> 8131.35s]  Stop shielding me stop doing anything right after he played the lane bad
[8133.61s -> 8138.41s]  Then he started playing the victim thing when I asked him to be a human and like come over and like help me and play teamwork
[8138.57s -> 8140.57s]  You gotta remember I didn't blame him a single time
[8141.01s -> 8144.65s]  Right like I didn't say a single negative thing to this guy in game. I said let's work as a team
[8145.25s -> 8150.47s]  He got upset
[8150.47s -> 8156.83s]  Like I genuinely think it'd be great content if I could talk to this guy in discord and just like oh, I'd be so good
[8173.66s -> 8176.90s]  Like dude, I'm I'm trying to kill these people guys
[8179.20s -> 8181.36s]  That wasn't bad though. We got 800 golden
[8181.36s -> 8184.32s]  Not the worst, but I don't know if my team can install this
[8185.08s -> 8187.32s]  Maybe if they can like kill this they can stall it, but
[8191.54s -> 8193.54s]  Nah, they're yeah, that's that's gg
[8193.80s -> 8195.88s]  That was a disgusting tolly at W
[8234.38s -> 8243.09s]  I'm gonna add him and he'll probably not add me, but I might as well try this would be such a good learning experience. Oh
[8252.25s -> 8256.57s]  Excuse me, dude. I've had like bad heartburn today. I need to take one of those heartburn pills
[8262.27s -> 8265.47s]  What Lulu what man just say I just let it out
[8265.47s -> 8284.03s]  let it out let it out baby yo let's just just have a talk yo let's discord we can
[8284.03s -> 8307.45s]  bottom of you since I'm so bad yeah trust you you just blamed everyone but
[8307.45s -> 8317.78s]  yourself, but you didn't play correctly at all. You played lane completely wrong,
[8319.62s -> 8325.24s]  didn't help each other, left people to die on repeats,
[8327.00s -> 8369.64s]  then played victim. I genuinely want to help you. This guy screenshoted what I just said
[8369.64s -> 8386.92s]  and put it in the endgame chat. What is happening right now? What is going on?
[8386.92s -> 8403.88s]  There is no way that this is not an NPC! There is no way! This is not an NPC!
[8403.88s -> 8421.26s]  there's no way there's no way it's Geronimo Lamal it is me yes bro just come
[8421.26s -> 8435.49s]  talking discord I'm not even gonna flame you what does this even mean bro I
[8435.49s -> 8442.40s]  don't think I've seen anybody more insecure in my life bro you are so
[8442.40s -> 8443.72s]  Oh, insecure.
[8445.10s -> 8451.11s]  It's cringe how insecure you are.
[8451.11s -> 8452.65s]  Like, oof.
[8453.91s -> 8454.83s]  Good luck, man.
[8455.75s -> 8460.75s]  On the climb to masters, but Jesus Christ.
[8464.33s -> 8468.00s]  That's sad.
[8468.00s -> 8469.28s]  Oh, God.
[8469.28s -> 8471.62s]  I, dude, I don't even know what to say.
[8471.62s -> 8473.04s]  Like, I'm gonna be real.
[8473.04s -> 8475.40s]  I was, like, I'm not even gonna flame the guy, right?
[8475.40s -> 8483.24s]  I just genuinely want to improve the community because that was three straight supports in
[8483.24s -> 8488.24s]  a row that didn't know how to play Lulu and I'm not even going to flame the guy's skill.
[8488.24s -> 8489.24s]  He's not a Lulu player, right?
[8489.24s -> 8490.32s]  He doesn't play Lulu.
[8490.32s -> 8491.44s]  That's fine.
[8491.44s -> 8496.80s]  But the issue was that I had with that guy specifically was that it's okay to be
[8496.80s -> 8498.52s]  bad at the game, right?
[8498.52s -> 8501.04s]  There's nothing wrong with being bad at League.
[8501.04s -> 8502.44s]  Everybody has bad games.
[8502.44s -> 8505.54s]  But when we're playing a game together and you're saying it's winnable and you want to
[8505.54s -> 8512.20s]  win the game, you can't pick and choose who to like help win the game.
[8512.20s -> 8516.96s]  Like if I'm sitting there bot lane, we're both being dove by Jin and you're intentionally
[8516.96s -> 8523.16s]  trying not to take damage and not die because you want to value your KDA over everything
[8523.16s -> 8524.28s]  else.
[8524.28s -> 8528.64s]  So that I, you know what, hold on, let me think about this.
[8528.64s -> 8531.96s]  I think I figured this person out.
[8531.96s -> 8535.68s]  This person lives in delusion, and I think I figured this out, let me explain this.
[8535.68s -> 8540.36s]  A lot of players do this, but I think I'm figuring this out as I'm thinking about this.
[8540.36s -> 8544.96s]  So this person has really good KDAs on their profile, right?
[8544.96s -> 8546.64s]  This eye-catching person.
[8546.64s -> 8549.64s]  They have really, really good KDAs on their profile, right?
[8549.64s -> 8555.48s]  This person doesn't ever take risks, doesn't ever do anything to try and win the game
[8555.48s -> 8561.14s]  outside of just existing and hitting buttons.
[8561.14s -> 8566.60s]  And what they do is they will always have good KDAs and they will sit here and never
[8566.60s -> 8568.66s]  like I know why they're losing.
[8568.66s -> 8572.14s]  They will sit here and they will do this shit where they have good KDAs they don't ever
[8572.14s -> 8574.34s]  die that much blah blah blah.
[8574.34s -> 8579.62s]  But what they do is they lie to themselves and they say look how good my KDAs are.
[8579.62s -> 8585.14s]  If I had better teammates I'd always win.
[8585.14s -> 8589.20s]  Like I cracked the code actually.
[8589.20s -> 8590.90s]  That's totally what it is.
[8590.90s -> 8596.96s]  The players actually like play so safe and they play for statistics, right?
[8596.96s -> 8602.30s]  They play like purely for the stats and then they can say that it was their team's fault
[8602.30s -> 8612.70s]  that they didn't win because they played really bad, but they didn't die.
[8612.70s -> 8618.14s]  Because I mean, in theory I could have a perfect KDA on every AD carry I play, right?
[8618.14s -> 8622.66s]  All I'd have to do is literally walk up, get one kill and then AFK and stand in
[8622.66s -> 8625.78s]  the base the rest of the game.
[8625.78s -> 8627.66s]  And I could be like, yo, why's my team not able to carry?
[8627.66s -> 8631.49s]  What's happening?
[8631.49s -> 8632.45s]  Right?
[8632.45s -> 8634.01s]  Well, you could literally do that.
[8634.01s -> 8635.45s]  No, I seriously think the person's
[8635.45s -> 8636.77s]  self-gaslighting himself.
[8638.13s -> 8638.97s]  Like, I'm serious.
[8638.97s -> 8640.97s]  I think this person's like self-gaslighting
[8640.97s -> 8643.85s]  where they're like, oh, it's my team's fault every game.
[8643.85s -> 8644.69s]  Right?
[8644.69s -> 8645.51s]  Like they're always blaming their team
[8645.51s -> 8648.33s]  for their loses and their mistakes and shits.
[8648.33s -> 8651.77s]  And it's sad because like, there's a reason you're D2.
[8651.77s -> 8653.21s]  And I'm not saying that to be toxic.
[8653.21s -> 8655.97s]  I'm saying that like, you haven't improved in four years.
[8655.97s -> 8657.49s]  And you haven't improved because all you're doing
[8657.49s -> 8659.79s]  is playing to blame your team every single game
[8659.79s -> 8662.51s]  when I just saw like 500 mistakes that you made
[8662.51s -> 8671.68s]  that we could have won the game off of early game.
[8671.68s -> 8672.96s]  Here, I remember somebody wanted me
[8672.96s -> 8675.00s]  to play a Caitlyn game last game.
[8675.00s -> 8676.64s]  So we're gonna play Cait.
[8677.84s -> 8679.68s]  I don't remember who it was in the chat.
[8679.68s -> 8681.76s]  Somebody like two people said Cait,
[8681.76s -> 8684.24s]  but we'll do a Cait game for you guys.
[8684.24s -> 8703.33s]  I got you boys, don't worry.
[8703.33s -> 8706.17s]  All right, I'm gonna take Ghost Flash
[8706.17s -> 8707.49s]  because they have three melee champs,
[8707.49s -> 8708.33s]  four melee champs.
[8708.33s -> 8710.49s]  They have Recon Zed, Kled, Gragas.
[8710.49s -> 8715.77s]  So I'm gonna take Ghost Flash, these are gonna be my runes this game, I'm gonna take a little
[8715.77s -> 8719.17s]  more MR because I don't think we're gonna be fighting too much in lane, we're pretty
[8719.17s -> 8723.37s]  much just gonna be poking them with Karma Kate, so I'm gonna take a little bit of extra
[8723.37s -> 8728.05s]  MR because I'm gonna be playing for mid delay game, I'm just scaling.
[8728.05s -> 8739.21s]  And these are gonna be the runes that I take, even classed on adc or the easier
[8739.21s -> 8743.93s]  to play ones in adc, I usually do like when I'm playing on this account right
[8743.93s -> 8746.45s]  now, this is like my teaching account.
[8746.45s -> 8749.33s]  It's a little lower MMR, it's like D1 Low Masters.
[8749.33s -> 8755.67s]  I usually play 80 carries that the chat wants to see me play so that you guys can learn good
[8755.67s -> 8759.03s]  and bad matchups and things like that.
[8759.03s -> 8764.45s]  The last two games I got way too tilted by shitty support players like Egos and all
[8764.45s -> 8765.45s]  that shit.
[8765.45s -> 8767.67s]  I got way too frustrated and I played bad the last two games.
[8767.67s -> 8771.29s]  So we're gonna, honestly I think I'm just gonna mute these people at the very
[8771.29s -> 8772.29s]  start of the game.
[8772.29s -> 8777.35s]  Normally, I wouldn't suggest you meet people because like playing as a team is really important
[8778.55s -> 8782.15s]  Because like you know you need to communicate and all that shit, but I am just like I'm gonna meet them
[8783.75s -> 8785.75s]  Cuz I
[8785.79s -> 8789.91s]  Dude my mental is taking a fucking hit right now. So we're gonna just chill and play I
[8793.61s -> 8798.61s]  Just don't know how to play Nila. I think Nila's really good. I just don't I don't know how to play her. I
[8799.99s -> 8806.46s]  Think she's a great champ like I've been getting shit on by Nila on my main account
[8807.80s -> 8822.58s]  Like a lot of Grandmaster Nyla's have been dumps during me. I think she's just really good at abusing solo queue
[8823.52s -> 8828.22s]  Like the the issue with Nyla is from what I've seen all the losses. I've had with Nyla
[8829.26s -> 8832.04s]  People don't it's like the thing I was telling you about before
[8832.88s -> 8834.88s]  people don't play aggressively in
[8835.36s -> 8841.04s]  The lower elos like even in Grandmaster people don't play like aggressively enough. It sounds crazy to say that but it's true
[8841.04s -> 8846.14s]  They don't play aggressively enough in lane so you can get away with just picking Nyla and scaling and
[8846.56s -> 8850.64s]  Nyla at like one item you'll always be up in levels right because that's how the champion works
[8852.08s -> 8855.58s]  The champion works in like you'll always be up in levels because of her passive so
[8856.06s -> 8862.74s]  You basically just like scale through existing. It's pretty it's pretty interesting
[8864.16s -> 8870.31s]  All right, so we're playing Kate karma. Oh, I missed the minion because I suck
[8871.41s -> 8873.41s]  I'm gonna ward this bush
[8873.41s -> 8883.94s]  Just because I don't want the Rakan in the bush.
[8883.94s -> 8888.36s]  So now that the bush isn't warded anymore, um, okay, warded nice, I was gonna say what
[8888.36s -> 8894.92s]  I want to do is I actually want to play, aw I suck, I actually wanted to play, oh man
[8894.92s -> 8899.66s]  I'm so bad at Cait, I wanted to play on the top side of the wave so that I'm not standing
[8899.66s -> 8901.42s]  near the bushes right?
[8901.42s -> 8905.70s]  Because if you stand near the bushes, the Rakan can obviously like W me and I just
[8905.70s -> 8910.78s]  get fucked so, I'd rather play in a safer spot, can't believe I missed 2 CS I'm
[8910.78s -> 8916.62s]  I'm so fucking bad now I want to push in wave 3 and I want to go buy a call so I'm gonna ping to push
[8925.38s -> 8927.00s]  Okay
[8927.00s -> 8929.60s]  So I actually want to back here, and I'm gonna go buy a call
[8930.12s -> 8932.12s]  So this is called a cheater recall
[8933.28s -> 8937.08s]  You usually have perfect CS the back on this timer
[8937.84s -> 8939.84s]  Go and you can go buy a call. Okay
[8940.32s -> 8944.32s]  This is like something that you can do if you're in a lane that's gonna be perma shoving
[8944.32s -> 8951.28s]  So what happens is the reason it's called the cheetah recall is because we pushed the wave in they had to stay and farm the wave
[8951.60s -> 8953.60s]  Right now watch
[8953.64s -> 8961.37s]  They have to push this wave in right now if karma was here instead of roaming this room is fine by the way
[8961.37s -> 8964.05s]  But if she was here instead of roaming she could actually hold the wave
[8965.17s -> 8970.41s]  And if you notice here, I don't actually miss that many minions right we're chilling now
[8974.89s -> 8978.93s]  We can slow push this we're safe. I should actually fast push this
[8978.93s -> 8985.07s]  because I wanted to bounce I don't want to so push this but I can't I can't fast
[8985.07s -> 8994.19s]  push this at level three by myself so we're just gonna chill
[8994.19s -> 8999.83s]  Kaelin's really good at abusing like early lane phase bullying just based on
[8999.83s -> 9003.33s]  like what our kit does we see we're con on the map top side you get you see
[9003.33s -> 9010.41s]  that's so because we see we're con I can walk up a bit and we can play a
[9010.41s -> 9020.74s]  little aggro here you can kind of see like I don't have to play behind the
[9020.74s -> 9024.80s]  minion wave you see what I'm doing to this guy right I hate this game we can
[9024.80s -> 9034.09s]  quit we can we can forfeit it's fun I hate this game I really hate this game
[9034.09s -> 9041.06s]  dude what is wrong with me right now it's like my brain doesn't work it's
[9041.06s -> 9051.26s]  the 280 K nerf telling you so we're cons gonna be bought right now I know
[9051.26s -> 9056.34s]  he's gonna be bought so I need to be a little care now my karma is here
[9056.34s -> 9066.46s]  there we go so you notice I didn't use any spells I'm not I'm just chilling dude
[9066.46s -> 9073.70s]  are you kidding me man I'm gonna be honest I'm getting really tilted by these
[9073.70s -> 9081.92s]  players now like the Recon W's in they just stand there and watch me die okay
[9081.92s -> 9084.76s]  it's fine listen I'm not gonna get too mad about it it's fine I should have
[9084.76s -> 9088.52s]  flashed the knockup I guess even though in reality I should never have to
[9088.52s -> 9091.88s]  flash the knockup but I should have flashed it because I can't trust the
[9091.88s -> 9095.44s]  teammates so what I'm saying is right there karma and fiddle were both right
[9095.44s -> 9099.36s]  here I was being chased down they stood here they didn't they didn't walk up to
[9099.36s -> 9104.96s]  do anything they just stood and waited that pisses me off because I hate when
[9104.96s -> 9114.89s]  players play selfish and scared it's my biggest pet peeve it drives me fucking
[9114.89s -> 9126.82s]  crazy man sorry I'm getting I'm losing my mind like it's so easy it's fine
[9126.82s -> 9142.52s]  No, I shouldn't have walked up and egoed it. It's on me. I want to so push this wave
[9143.06s -> 9149.99s]  Yeah, I'm losing it
[9149.99s -> 9157.95s]  This by the way would be an example of a bad time for karma to run. She needs to come back bot
[9158.39s -> 9164.18s]  There's absolutely no reason for it a room on that timer
[9165.02s -> 9167.10s]  There's also no reason for it to be in that bush over there
[9167.10s -> 9172.74s]  We should be playing up to try we're playing Kate karma, right? We should be playing forward so that we can actually be aggressive
[9173.66s -> 9175.10s]  Kate karma's a lane bully lane
[9175.10s -> 9179.18s]  We don't want to sit here and just do nothing if you pick karma you want to be aggressive
[9179.18s -> 9181.58s]  you want to be playing up you want to be stunning you want to be doing like
[9181.58s -> 9188.53s]  aggressive things playing the game we're level six I'd really like to like go in
[9188.53s -> 9200.61s]  yeah like that was actually not bad by the karma she w'd the Ziya and then I
[9200.61s -> 9223.70s]  got to trap off of it so that wasn't too bad not the worst not not bad that
[9223.70s -> 9227.50s]  was good those good really nice really nice okay so I'm gonna back here
[9227.50s -> 9248.26s]  cuz I don't want to overstay for the wave I'm gonna grab boots you don't
[9248.26s -> 9254.56s]  I think a lot of it is too. I think a lot of it is people get really scared when they like Rickon is really strong in this meta
[9254.56s -> 9258.48s]  Right, like he's very very powerful. He's like numbers are a little too high right now
[9258.48s -> 9260.38s]  So like everything he does is just a little too good
[9260.70s -> 9265.98s]  So I think people get nervous around Rickon especially with Zaya because it's like when people would get nervous around non-illusion
[9266.26s -> 9269.22s]  The lane like plays itself. It's very strong. It's very hard to beat
[9269.58s -> 9272.28s]  But you can still see people making mistakes when they play the lane
[9272.28s -> 9283.35s]  So you got to watch for that type of stuff now a good way to play against a Zaya once you hit six
[9287.41s -> 9289.41s]  Is you don't want to
[9291.07s -> 9296.13s]  You don't want to ever walk melee range of her or give her the ability to just kill you with the feathers
[9296.65s -> 9298.65s]  your main goal here is gonna be
[9298.93s -> 9300.93s]  Try and stay in a good spot when it comes to
[9302.05s -> 9304.05s]  Feathers like I want to be to the side of her
[9304.39s -> 9308.69s]  The side of her is the best option like where she can't pull in like I'll get hit by maybe a few
[9308.85s -> 9313.43s]  But she can't pull in all of them. That's a really
[9313.43s -> 9318.11s]  really key thing when playing versus her because I remember back in the day I didn't know how
[9318.11s -> 9321.47s]  to play Versaia and I would always get fucking frustrated as shit.
[9321.47s -> 9322.47s]  So Rakan's 5.
[9322.47s -> 9325.49s]  I want to hit tab, see Rakan's 5.
[9325.49s -> 9329.85s]  We shouldn't be able to die here.
[9329.85s -> 9333.81s]  I want to push this wave in, but I also need to stay away from where the Rakan could
[9333.81s -> 9336.12s]  be.
[9336.12s -> 9341.08s]  So if you want to push waves in and reset the wave, make sure that you're standing
[9341.08s -> 9344.20s]  as far away as you can from where they can engage on you.
[9344.20s -> 9350.49s]  Now they're about to be 6.
[9350.49s -> 9355.85s]  So they have a really strong level 6. She has pickaxe and noon quiver. We do want to be a little hesitant here
[9355.85s -> 9357.85s]  We don't want to fight
[9358.21s -> 9360.65s]  Now I'm gonna kind of push this in a bit
[9361.45s -> 9367.01s]  We should have been spam pushing the whole wave because that's how Kate karma plays. We just push push push push
[9367.81s -> 9371.33s]  But we played that that early roam by karma
[9372.57s -> 9374.57s]  Kind of put us behind on that
[9375.17s -> 9377.17s]  It's not a big deal. It's just something that
[9377.69s -> 9379.69s]  We have to adjust
[9379.69s -> 9408.17s]  Why does this say 88 and this say 90? Which one is it? Is it 88 or 90? I mean that guy's
[9408.17s -> 9420.20s]  dead. I don't know what that Karma's thinking, but we probably have to give this Drake. I
[9420.20s -> 9424.52s]  mean maybe we could fight it if Fiddle had ulti, but him not having ult, yeah there's
[9424.52s -> 9438.18s]  no way. The higher one counts ward kills. Why? I think that's so stupid. So they
[9438.18s -> 9444.46s]  They might try and engage here unless they somehow know Fiddles in the bush, which would
[9444.46s -> 9448.59s]  be impressive because we know it's not warded.
[9448.59s -> 9464.39s]  So that'd be pretty impressive if they knew that.
[9464.39s -> 9465.87s]  We could actually Rift.
[9465.87s -> 9477.38s]  I'm just gonna Ghost.
[9477.38s -> 9478.38s]  This is crazy.
[9478.38s -> 9479.38s]  What the fuck?
[9479.38s -> 9486.34s]  Oh, this is interesting.
[9486.34s -> 9487.34s]  They saw Fiddles 100%.
[9487.34s -> 9488.54s]  Yeah, I don't know where though.
[9488.54s -> 9490.86s]  It must have- because he used this thing.
[9490.86s -> 9496.08s]  Fiddles used his whatever it's called.
[9496.08s -> 9497.08s]  His effigy.
[9497.08s -> 9508.30s]  I'd have to go look one man. Oh, I guess I didn't see it. I should back I can get dove here
[9508.58s -> 9512.70s]  We don't know where Gragas is like if Gragas happens to be like he ease over this wall or something. I
[9513.10s -> 9515.98s]  Think it don't really easy. I'm greeting really hard
[9517.10s -> 9519.10s]  Greeting usually gets you killed
[9519.10s -> 9520.74s]  typically I
[9520.74s -> 9524.02s]  Shouldn't be doing this
[9524.02s -> 9527.54s]  They're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right?
[9528.18s -> 9529.78s]  it's like
[9529.78s -> 9532.66s]  If you know something it's gonna be a bad habit you should not do it
[9532.66s -> 9543.68s]  just cue the bush okay that was I meant use like an actual queue they could
[9543.68s -> 9553.34s]  also be in the alcove so I'm a little hesitant but it's fine okay so the reason
[9553.34s -> 9558.02s]  I stayed was because now I have my I have my mythic right because we finished
[9558.02s -> 9563.22s]  the coal and we finished the mythic at the same time or finished the wave so now
[9563.22s -> 9568.10s]  I have two options I go gale force here to dodge a lot of their shits or I
[9568.10s -> 9575.18s]  can do what sounds like a fun option. We're gonna do shield bow. I'm gonna show you guys
[9575.18s -> 9581.90s]  why I like shield bow on Caitlyn. It's not the best mythic, but it's good into certain
[9581.90s -> 9591.22s]  comps if you don't want to get a Gale. Because I have a Lackardy this game, I don't have
[9591.22s -> 9601.45s]  Bloodline, right? So I kind of want to go shield bow, and then I'm gonna end up
[9601.45s -> 9612.93s]  going either IE or I'm gonna end up going like bloodthirster seconds. IE or BT? Probably IE
[9612.93s -> 9626.04s]  just because I think it's actually easier to go IE in this game. But yeah, this is a kind
[9626.04s -> 9637.64s]  of boring game. Our team's doing really well though, so we just chill. We gotta be a little
[9637.64s -> 9659.20s]  care. Okay. It was kind of hard to do anything there. Even though I got like a few autos on
[9659.20s -> 9667.52s]  the Gragas, it's a little difficult to actually play the game there. Because if
[9667.52s -> 9672.08s]  If I walk up too far, like, see Rakan's there, if I walk up too far, I just get, uh, killed
[9672.08s -> 9673.08s]  by Rakan.
[9673.08s -> 9679.78s]  Alright, I'm just gonna reset and go get boots.
[9679.78s -> 9687.90s]  Typically, AD Carry is really fucking boring, uh, in games like this, where you can't
[9687.90s -> 9689.30s]  really blow the game open.
[9689.30s -> 9694.27s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[9694.27s -> 9695.27s]  Maybe?
[9695.27s -> 9696.27s]  Wait?
[9696.27s -> 9697.27s]  Karma shield me?
[9697.27s -> 9700.48s]  I'm not dead?
[9700.48s -> 9701.48s]  Nice.
[9701.48s -> 9702.48s]  Fuck!
[9702.48s -> 9722.80s]  Motherfucker, co-read me, man.
[9722.80s -> 9734.95s]  man here's like go we can fight this though they have no ults like this is
[9734.95s -> 9742.85s]  actually fightable they have no Ziyar and no a dragasar and this is also why
[9742.85s -> 9746.21s]  it's really important that you relate to your team the cooldowns of your team
[9746.21s -> 9750.53s]  remember that don't forget that if somebody uses a big cooldown tell your
[9750.53s -> 9754.61s]  team because that was an illegal dragon right like they just that was one
[9754.61s -> 9759.77s]  of the most illegal things I've seen in a while homie completely griefed
[9759.77s -> 9784.26s]  That's another very very very important thing that you need to take away from playing league and being like this is what I was saying about theteam
[9784.26s -> 9786.26s]  working shit earlier
[9786.38s -> 9789.86s]  Being good at the game is a lot of spreading knowledge as well, right?
[9790.94s -> 9796.02s]  Like if you if your team doesn't know if a flash is up or down you have to play completely differently, right?
[9796.42s -> 9800.08s]  Like you got to think about the game in that in terms of that as well like how many times have you seen like
[9800.54s -> 9804.18s]  You know, you're like, oh, I can walk up here if this guy can't flash ult me or something, right?
[9804.18s -> 9820.87s]  It happens all the time. I wonder if I can kill a Duskblade Zed. I don't know. I probably could
[9831.12s -> 9832.62s]  I should go Med.
[9832.62s -> 9838.21s]  What do you think about Teemo and other top lane as AD carry?
[9838.21s -> 9843.30s]  I play Teemo AD carry when I'm playing for fun sometimes.
[9844.22s -> 9853.87s]  It's okay.
[9853.87s -> 9855.87s]  Yo, go look on your game, man.
[9856.07s -> 9860.11s]  So during the mid game is Caitlyn. A few things that I can kind of teach you.
[9860.11s -> 9863.39s]  This was kind of a boring lane phase, right? Like we didn't really do that much.
[9863.39s -> 9869.03s]  The lane phase was essentially just like we died once and then you know everything all hell broke was
[9869.91s -> 9871.91s]  When you're walk up the fights like this
[9872.43s -> 9874.99s]  Make sure that you're putting traps down in places
[9875.63s -> 9884.98s]  Where the enemy has to walk just like that
[9885.66s -> 9890.02s]  Playing 80 playing Caitlyn is not always about just like auto-ing and getting cues and shit
[9890.02s -> 9894.00s]  If you noticed during that fight, I put two traps here two traps here
[9894.00s -> 9900.85s]  I forced the enemy team into like a location where they had to eat traps or they
[9901.81s -> 9910.00s]  They can't find us right? And even if like they avoid the traps they're still having to like move their character
[9910.56s -> 9914.40s]  In a very unique specific way that they probably don't want to do
[9918.35s -> 9921.63s]  So you should always be thinking where should I put these traps down at the start of the fight not like
[9921.71s -> 9928.27s]  How do I get autos off think about using your traps to zone and to like control the team fight before the fight starts rather than using it to
[9929.87s -> 9932.99s]  Do damage because they'll step in the traps themselves
[9932.99s -> 9937.51s]  people will just people are stupid they're bad people aren't paying
[9937.51s -> 9942.71s]  attention everything I'm bad you know what I mean people can't pay attention to
[9942.71s -> 9946.19s]  every bush that you're putting traps in during a big fight it's it's too much
[9946.19s -> 9969.45s]  attention span nobody has it nice oh big tip for all the 80 carries in chat
[9969.45s -> 9975.49s]  guys I'll tell you right now once the 20 minute mark happens in league your
[9975.49s -> 9981.01s]  jungler's camps are no longer his. I know, I know junglers are gonna hate me for this, okay?
[9981.01s -> 9984.13s]  Listen, if you're a jungle player and you're like, fuck this guy now, I hate him. Listen,
[9984.13s -> 9989.41s]  you know it's true. You know, at 20 minutes, your camps no longer, like, they're not yours
[9989.41s -> 9994.53s]  anymore, man, okay? Like, you, you, you are full items at this point, okay? Like,
[9994.53s -> 10001.58s]  I want to be honest, you would, I'm taking your camps. I'm trying to get my third item
[10001.58s -> 10014.11s]  as fast as humanly possible, because 80 carries spike on three items extremely hard.
[10014.51s -> 10024.43s]  Man, I want to walk top but we have no vision of this area, so it's a little scary
[10025.01s -> 10030.76s]  Like I said, I typically don't like to take
[10031.48s -> 10033.48s]  jungles camps early game ever
[10034.10s -> 10036.96s]  Because like that's why I say like at 20 minutes
[10036.96s -> 10041.70s]  Usually you have two items at this point if you're like farming decent, and you know, etc
[10042.24s -> 10046.02s]  Sometimes they'll be faster, but usually it's around average of like you'll have your items at this points
[10048.61s -> 10051.65s]  Always be tabbing to the teamfights even if you're farming as well
[10073.26s -> 10075.26s]  Zed is in this bush
[10075.26s -> 10081.66s]  Wait, where is he wait? I'm stupid. Where'd he go? Oh?
[10082.66s -> 10084.66s]  He died I killed him
[10085.38s -> 10094.75s]  Wow, I'm really smart. I like didn't notice that I killed that guy
[10095.87s -> 10097.55s]  I'm so dumb
[10097.55s -> 10111.22s]  80 carry brain right boys. I was like playing that so scared too because I was like I was like is he there
[10121.02s -> 10123.02s]  Pull the dragon out
[10123.82s -> 10129.18s]  Why ask this yesterday, but what do you guys think the coolest looking dragon is I swear it's the I
[10129.18s -> 10131.86s]  I think mountain Drake looks fucking sick
[10168.86s -> 10171.78s]  Welcome to the here you saw that I like time to push man, right?
[10173.42s -> 10181.98s]  That's mainly because we are karma just got picked off and I don't want to give them the option of pushing the wave
[10181.98s -> 10207.52s]  So by pushing the lane nice by pushing the lane in it takes away an option for the enemy
[10208.16s -> 10210.56s]  That's something that a lot of people think like oh, I just want farm
[10210.56s -> 10214.98s]  I don't care about the farm right like when I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game
[10215.40s -> 10220.84s]  And I'm pushing like a mid mid wave in before a fight if we're just sieging around the Baron
[10222.16s -> 10226.64s]  Having that wave pushed in gives them gives us another option. I'm like what we can do in the game
[10227.32s -> 10229.68s]  And it takes you three seconds to push it in so
[10230.52s -> 10232.52s]  if the fight's already over and
[10233.36s -> 10240.48s]  You have time always be paying attention to like trying to push in waves so that you can create a little bit of that pressure
[10240.64s -> 10242.80s]  Yo, hey, thank you so much for the 14 man. Welcome back
[10242.80s -> 10246.18s]  What do I get next I kind of want to get BT
[10247.00s -> 10251.41s]  I'm gonna get BT I
[10251.41s -> 10258.37s]  Could get Dom's, but I think BT's better because the I already have over here right so the shield from BT plus shield
[10258.37s -> 10262.09s]  Bo plus ie I don't think I'll be able to die. Okay. I think I'm unkillable
[10262.77s -> 10265.09s]  Act actually I actually unkillable
[10265.81s -> 10269.39s]  So here I'm gonna actually give these camps the fiddle because he's literally pathing to them
[10269.39s -> 10271.39s]  I don't want to be an asshole, but
[10271.65s -> 10288.90s]  Wow, what just happened I'm bad
[10289.44s -> 10293.12s]  I feel like I got hooked by Kled. Oh
[10294.44s -> 10296.44s]  He flashed okay. I
[10297.64s -> 10301.80s]  Was like I feel like what just happened was like I missed position because like I went up here
[10301.80s -> 10305.00s]  Right like I ghosted one up here because there was two people here two people here
[10305.00s -> 10310.56s]  I put traps down these kind of sloppy traps, and then I positioned here and then Kled flashed cued me under the
[10310.56s -> 10312.56s]  Yeah, okay, that makes sense
[10312.56s -> 10322.33s]  I'm just bad. It was okay though because if the entire enemy team has to literally
[10325.17s -> 10330.37s]  Like double flash on you to kill you under the turret and then your team follow us up. It's not that big of a deal
[10331.05s -> 10333.05s]  Gale force would have saved me there though. Actually
[10334.45s -> 10340.46s]  Loki gale force totally would save me
[10341.42s -> 10343.42s]  Because he has serpents
[10345.73s -> 10350.41s]  Serpents definitely shits on chilebo. I'm kind of stupid for going to show about this game. I
[10353.05s -> 10357.73s]  Wanted to try it out because I when I before when I was playing Caitlyn like before the IE rework and everything
[10358.17s -> 10359.77s]  everybody would go
[10359.77s -> 10363.57s]  Or there was like one guy in Challenger would go shield bow into shit every game
[10363.57s -> 10368.65s]  And I wanted to see if like it was still viable, but there might just be better options now like always scale force a
[10369.65s -> 10376.18s]  BT or something. Oh my god. I flashed late. I'm dead
[10379.05s -> 10382.53s]  Dude, I flashed late for some reason. I'm so dumb
[10383.29s -> 10385.29s]  my bad
[10385.61s -> 10387.25s]  I was given an B
[10387.25s -> 10389.25s]  Like my brain is moving slowly
[10389.97s -> 10391.97s]  Like I can feel it turning
[10392.65s -> 10394.65s]  I'm just playing bad
[10394.65s -> 10398.29s]  Like I was baiting the Kled to go in on me because karma was there
[10398.39s -> 10401.13s]  But what I need to do is I need to trap on top myself when he goes in
[10401.69s -> 10404.73s]  Then I need to flash knit and the Kled just dies
[10405.33s -> 10408.90s]  You can also just kill him. I
[10410.18s -> 10423.78s]  Was gonna say they have nothing we just play for dragon here. I don't know why I'm playing so bad today
[10423.78s -> 10427.42s]  I played bad yesterday, too. I don't know what's going on my like brain is broken
[10444.95s -> 10446.95s]  Dude, they're recon was trying so hard
[10446.95s -> 10490.37s]  I'll make this quick. Oh, I've made so many mistakes this game. I fucked up positioning mechanics farm
[10491.25s -> 10499.49s]  all kinds of shit
[10499.65s -> 10509.77s]  I still don't want our Dom's actually. I don't think Lord Dom's is good this game
[10510.65s -> 10515.13s]  Like they have no armor like Kled has merc treads
[10516.87s -> 10518.87s]  Which I feel like
[10519.87s -> 10521.87s]  Really bad indoor team, but oh
[10521.87s -> 10534.46s]  Oh, a little tip that you guys can have for Caitlyn too.
[10534.46s -> 10538.38s]  When you are like barons up in 50 seconds, right?
[10538.38s -> 10542.74s]  So a little thing you can do that's actually kind of fun is you want to be at the objective
[10542.74s -> 10546.18s]  before the like, rule with them when an objective is coming up, you always want to be on that
[10546.18s -> 10549.74s]  side of the map before the objective comes up.
[10549.74s -> 10557.94s]  But you can put down traps in the bushes around the objectives and people will face
[10557.94s -> 10563.14s]  check them and you can just one tap them away game it's actually incredibly fun
[10563.14s -> 10569.60s]  but you just put them in the corners of the bushes where people have to walk
[10569.60s -> 10590.42s]  like right here I can put it right between the turret I don't know why I
[10590.42s -> 10598.03s]  didn't ghost I'll be honest I have no idea why didn't ghost I was like saving
[10598.03s -> 10604.63s]  it for something I'm not sure what next year a birthday present who the
[10604.63s -> 10613.50s]  fuck knows I could have one shot that guy if I was better at Kate I did I
[10613.50s -> 10618.72s]  I did a really classic combo right there, I just didn't Q because I'm bad.
[10618.72s -> 10621.88s]  I should have, when he hit the trap, your two headshots, sit on him for a few seconds,
[10621.88s -> 10625.12s]  so what I should have done is I should have instantly Q'd on top of the trap, then auto-auto'd
[10625.12s -> 10626.62s]  and he would have died.
[10626.62s -> 10629.96s]  Because your Q does the max damage when they're trapped too, so it would have been like
[10629.96s -> 10631.56s]  just a perfect three-shot.
[10631.56s -> 10636.24s]  But like I said, I don't play Cait enough and my muscle memories kind of trash sometimes,
[10636.24s -> 10638.72s]  so that was my bad.
[10638.72s -> 10651.08s]  Oh, we're getting cluttered.
[10651.08s -> 10672.34s]  I don't know where he is, but I shouldn't have done that.
[10672.34s -> 10678.81s]  I'm limit testing really hard right now. I suggest you guys don't limit test
[10678.81s -> 10680.35s]  Well, actually I do think you should limit test
[10680.35s -> 10684.09s]  But not if you want to win like play safer like right there the play wasn't to go back in
[10684.39s -> 10687.61s]  The play was the like back off, but I wanted to see if I could like I
[10690.26s -> 10692.26s]  Wanted to see if I was terrible or not
[10693.28s -> 10695.52s]  You know I was
[10697.30s -> 10703.90s]  But yeah, I mean the combo with Kate is like if they're trapped you want to queue while they're in the trap essentially because
[10703.90s -> 10711.98s]  Because your auto will always give you the range so if you auto and then Q, when they're
[10711.98s -> 10716.58s]  trapped they get, not a lot of people know this because I just found this out like a few
[10716.58s -> 10721.10s]  years or like after I should have.
[10721.10s -> 10726.38s]  When you Q on top of a K trap, the way K hits Q works is when you Q the initial like it
[10726.38s -> 10730.70s]  hits initially and then it does less damage to the targets behind it, right?
[10730.70s -> 10732.70s]  It's very narrow and then it like gets bigger.
[10732.70s -> 10738.42s]  So when they're trapped though, it does the maximum Q damage that it can do in like the
[10738.42s -> 10740.02s]  isolation of the Q.
[10740.02s -> 10745.53s]  So that's why when people are trapped you want to open up with your Q.
[10745.53s -> 10750.85s]  You either want to net into the Q and then double auto, or you want to net or you want
[10750.85s -> 10756.41s]  to like you want to Q, then trap net at the same time, then double auto.
[10756.41s -> 10759.21s]  You basically it's a very interesting way to play.
[10759.21s -> 10762.09s]  You always want to try and overlay a trap on your trap.
[10762.09s -> 10766.89s]  So when they get trapped, you can overlay a second trap to either in front of them or
[10766.89s -> 10767.89s]  behind them.
[10767.89s -> 10772.45s]  And what'll happen is there's actually like a little mini, like I want to say one second
[10772.45s -> 10773.97s]  cooldown of being able to be trapped, right?
[10773.97s -> 10776.33s]  Like a little 1.52 second cooldown.
[10776.33s -> 10779.53s]  But what can happen is they sit in the trap, then what you can do is your neck can slow
[10779.53s -> 10780.53s]  them.
[10780.53s -> 10784.45s]  So you can, you can actually queue in the first trap, then you can drop a second
[10784.45s -> 10788.25s]  trap net, slow them into the second trap and then triple auto headshot them from
[10788.25s -> 10791.13s]  all three of the net, the two traps.
[10791.13s -> 10805.85s]  It's really complicated sounding, but this man does redeem to end my stream whenever
[10805.85s -> 10812.64s]  you want.
[10812.64s -> 10813.64s]  What?
[10813.64s -> 10817.17s]  Why?
[10817.17s -> 10823.99s]  Why would you want to end my stream right now?
[10823.99s -> 10838.13s]  Why would you want to be that guy?
[10838.13s -> 10839.13s]  Wow.
[10839.13s -> 10850.34s]  Okay.
[10850.34s -> 10854.66s]  Don't end, just change the camera position.
[10854.66s -> 10862.13s]  Did you just spend one million points to tell me to put the camera back on the right
[10862.13s -> 10863.41s]  side of my fucking-
[10863.41s -> 10881.62s]  No way. No way you just did that. I was like, this man is just flexing. He's just like,
[10881.62s -> 10889.81s]  yeah I got some points to spare. I guess I could like throw him, you know, eh. Alright,
[10889.81s -> 10912.06s]  fine. There's that better. Is that better? Drink water. Actually that's a good one.
[10912.06s -> 10918.51s]  I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some water. Should we play in our main? I kinda want to
[10918.51s -> 10924.15s]  try and hit GM. Yeah, let's get on our main account. It's like 1pm. So it's like 3pm Eastern.
[10924.15s -> 10933.25s]  I think I can get cues at the moment. Let me get some water and then we'll queue up or
[10933.25s -> 10944.16s]  we'll queue up then get some water real quick because I think I think it's late enough
[10944.16s -> 10954.78s]  than day I can get cues now without waiting 40 minutes. By the way, it is it is a teaching
[10954.78s -> 10958.40s]  stream when I'm doing that like 80 carry Academy thing. So if you guys have any questions
[10958.40s -> 10961.98s]  you want to ask or like you guys can ignore that if you guys have any questions you
[10961.98s -> 10964.10s]  you want to ask or anything like that?
[10964.10s -> 10967.34s]  You know, if we're just chilling between games, just ask whatever you want.
[10967.34s -> 10971.74s]  I can answer a lot easier between games than I can in-game.
[10971.74s -> 10973.30s]  You know, it's a lot easier for me to see that shit.
[10973.30s -> 10977.42s]  I try and answer in-game, but like sometimes I'm like focusing and shit, so it's a little
[10977.42s -> 10984.73s]  harder.
[10984.73s -> 10989.65s]  Uh, I'm gonna get some water though, so I'll be right back, okay?
[10989.65s -> 10991.89s]  Talk amongst yourselves.
[10991.89s -> 10993.53s]  Is Kraken troll on Kate?
[10993.53s -> 10995.61s]  No, Kraken's good on Kate.
[10995.61s -> 11002.69s]  You can go cracking into bloodthirster or cracking in the IE if you really need it if if they have like tanks so they have like scion
[11004.01s -> 11006.97s]  Sejuani stuff like that that you have to like you're the only damage
[11006.97s -> 11011.85s]  Let's say you're like the only tank killer on the team. You're like the only 80 damage. You have to go cracking sometimes
[15993.61s -> 15996.56s]  1.
[15996.56s -> 15997.56s]  2.
[15997.56s -> 15998.56s]  3.
[15998.56s -> 15999.56s]  4.
[15999.56s -> 16000.56s]  5.
[16000.56s -> 16001.56s]  6.
[16001.56s -> 16002.56s]  7.
[16002.56s -> 16003.56s]  8.
[16003.56s -> 16004.56s]  9.
[16004.56s -> 16005.56s]  9.
[16005.56s -> 16006.56s]  9.
[16006.56s -> 16007.56s]  9.
[16007.56s -> 16008.56s]  9.
[16008.56s -> 16009.56s]  9.
[16009.56s -> 16010.56s]  9.
[16010.56s -> 16011.56s]  9.
[16011.56s -> 16012.56s]  9.
[16012.56s -> 16013.56s]  10.
[16013.56s -> 16014.56s]  11.
[16014.56s -> 16015.56s]  12.
[16015.56s -> 16016.56s]  13.
[16016.56s -> 16017.56s]  14.
[16017.56s -> 16018.56s]  14.
[16018.56s -> 16019.56s]  15.
[16019.56s -> 16020.56s]  16.
[16020.56s -> 16021.56s]  17.
[16021.56s -> 16022.56s]  18.
[16022.56s -> 16023.56s]  19.
[16023.56s -> 16024.56s]  20.
[16024.56s -> 16029.32s]  He just gets killed we just bind him walk away, and he's stuck there, and he dies right?
[16029.84s -> 16031.64s]  But for some reason
[16031.64s -> 16036.48s]  She didn't understand how to do that so she was just throwing it to farm
[16036.48s -> 16042.12s]  So we would just get engaged on so I started roaming and every time I was like roaming to an objective or something
[16042.16s -> 16047.40s]  The graves would always walk away and not fight like he wasn't attempting to fight
[16047.40s -> 16049.60s]  He was basically just like oh, I'm gonna go farm some more
[16049.64s -> 16053.50s]  But I'm like dude you can't do that like if the Alistar's ganking made and I'm countering mid
[16053.50s -> 16057.86s]  You can't just farm farm before coming mid or you can't just like not take dragon and shit like that
[16057.86s -> 16064.20s]  Right like it blows my mind that these players can get like it's like this guy too same thing like that jungler last game, right?
[16064.72s -> 16068.64s]  Look at this. It's the same thing as the last game like NA is riddled with this shit
[16068.64s -> 16074.52s]  It's so miserable to play look at this this jungler last game, right? He's not he's what like a d1 player, right?
[16074.52s -> 16077.90s]  He's not a bad player he peeps d1, but why is this guy in this game now?
[16077.90s -> 16084.42s]  He like artificially inflated to the silo getting lucky with his first few games and now we have to play with this guy
[16084.42s -> 16086.42s]  Oh, it's an account share
[16086.42s -> 16093.19s]  The person it's a different player. Look on the account
[16094.93s -> 16098.50s]  D flash f flash so
[16099.38s -> 16101.38s]  It's a fucking account share
[16102.81s -> 16115.02s]  That's that's frustrating. Sorry for whining so much guys. This shit's just really frustrating to me
[16115.02s -> 16121.30s]  Like, I know I should play it to specifically only care about improving, and then while you're
[16121.30s -> 16127.90s]  improving you'll climb automatically and shit, but it's really frustrating when the players
[16127.90s -> 16132.22s]  in the game would rather be idiots and assholes than play the game.
[16132.22s -> 16138.38s]  The game before, the Amumu was just being toxic the whole game and into the win away.
[16138.38s -> 16141.98s]  The last game, the Lux and the Graves were being toxic to each other the whole game,
[16141.98s -> 16144.02s]  we entered the game away.
[16144.02s -> 16149.14s]  like I it's it's not fun to lose because one player gets mad at another
[16149.14s -> 16158.71s]  player over them both being idiots I'm sorry it's not fun it's so unfun but
[16158.71s -> 16174.88s]  we'll try and we'll try and win this one all we can really do is try and carry
[16174.88s -> 16193.94s]  the games right it's about it what is what what man what what do you think
[16193.94s -> 16197.62s]  they're gonna do to me welcome to the league of yeah I think of the seven
[16197.62s -> 16201.78s]  months man welcome back I really don't want to meet all I don't I don't want to
[16201.78s -> 16217.25s]  meet all because like I want to like value the pings and shit but dude if they
[16217.25s -> 16254.68s]  walk up I'm gonna flank them that's why I'm standing here that was a big cue I
[16254.68s -> 16277.73s]  need to get level two first here 100% Ash should have just been autoing there
[16277.73s -> 16282.57s]  that whole time because we have heal so she should have just walked up and
[16282.57s -> 16290.21s]  As soon as this is what I mean by tracking cooldowns as soon as the Niko missed her as soon as the Niko missed her cooldown
[16290.77s -> 16295.65s]  Soon she missed her E the ashes just walked up and immediately started fighting
[16296.85s -> 16303.91s]  Right like because they can no longer kill us the Niko doesn't actually have spells outside of her E
[16304.59s -> 16309.41s]  Right, so she misses that snare and she used her W too, right? So it's like we just go ham
[16309.41s -> 16317.25s]  You don't need to be too scared. It happens quite a bit sometimes where people will just be like really nervous
[16335.04s -> 16338.66s]  Damn if I had dodged that cue, I actually would have killed all three
[16339.32s -> 16344.52s]  Damn, I don't know if it was worth the flash after the guy. I actually I think it was if I had dodged the cue
[16344.52s -> 16346.16s]  I would have been fine
[16346.16s -> 16350.40s]  So that was that it's whatever. I can also doesn't miss any creeps here
[16350.80s -> 16352.56s]  So it's not the end of the world
[16352.56s -> 16359.41s]  Like I'm pretty sure Lee Sin did not have his top camps by the way
[16359.41s -> 16371.05s]  damn if I was a little better mechanically I turned that by the way hundred
[16371.05s -> 16398.46s]  percent we should push this wave so that I can go get vision is yeah that guy
[16398.46s -> 16426.19s]  can't freeze that wave so it's not too bad we since top you can kind of see some
[16426.19s -> 16440.10s]  really good what is this why is my car this AFK turret what is happening right
[16440.10s -> 16468.86s]  now why was he AFK I mean I guess it worked out but yeah maybe you had to go
[16468.86s -> 16470.86s]  Let his cat out and I don't know
[16472.64s -> 16481.80s]  Happens we do their bot lane is not very good
[16483.00s -> 16485.28s]  They're trying too hard to force fights that they can't win
[16489.58s -> 16492.44s]  Like they genuinely can't win half these fights that they're trying to force
[16493.76s -> 16496.98s]  Maybe if they were against people who like don't push their buttons they could win those
[16496.98s -> 16499.66s]  But it's like all I have to do is stand there and fight back and they lose
[16500.54s -> 16504.56s]  They're on dragon a thousand percent right now. There's not a lot I can do about that
[16504.56s -> 16512.20s]  We just have to chill there's almost nothing I can do about it. Kai says trying to fake act like she's big, but it's
[16515.79s -> 16517.79s]  There's just nothing we can do
[16519.24s -> 16529.19s]  Cuz our car this is top so we just chill they finish the cheer list. No, no, no not yet
[16530.51s -> 16533.91s]  Whoa
[16533.91s -> 16535.91s]  Lisa and could be bought right now
[16537.55s -> 16541.83s]  Mmm, I don't think it's too bad if he's bought though. They can't really dive us especially with card this old
[16556.98s -> 16559.10s]  Why why does my ash just run?
[16560.16s -> 16567.76s]  She like just straight up runs away. It's kind of silly
[16576.84s -> 16581.64s]  Cuz we have we have Carthus ulti like we can win that five or a we can win a fight bot right now
[16581.64s -> 16588.80s]  I guess I guess I'm just gonna have to get them low enough for Carthus to kill them
[16590.30s -> 16592.54s]  Like without the ashes help
[16593.66s -> 16595.66s]  Which I think I can do it's not too bad
[16596.22s -> 16599.53s]  Okay, the Akali's coming bot
[16600.41s -> 16602.41s]  We just killed him. I mean let's just fight
[16610.80s -> 16612.80s]  Don't know why we just ash arrow honestly
[16613.56s -> 16621.47s]  Just ash arrow
[16621.47s -> 16623.47s]  Okay, that was pretty bad ash arrow, but
[16630.56s -> 16633.64s]  Filled I don't think he's filled. I think he's just having a bad game
[16635.04s -> 16637.04s]  Like I think it happens, you know
[16637.60s -> 16642.52s]  Whoa, okay
[16642.52s -> 16644.68s]  Do it ult me. I fucking dare you
[16645.48s -> 16651.22s]  I'm trying to keep some mana
[16651.50s -> 16653.50s]  So that I can ulti
[16653.50s -> 16677.36s]  Oh, Karthus already used his ults. Fuck. They both backed there? Wow.
[16678.24s -> 16684.20s]  My bad. I honestly didn't think they were both gonna back there.
[16684.84s -> 16689.62s]  Like, I thought that Kaisa was gonna back right where I saw her like last.
[16690.66s -> 16692.50s]  That was my bad.
[16692.50s -> 16694.50s]  Mmm, I should be.
[16694.86s -> 16696.86s]  I think Lee Sin can come bot here and kill me.
[16699.84s -> 16701.84s]  I should actually stop this guy's back.
[16702.08s -> 16712.33s]  Yeah, I should stop his back because it's more value to stop the back now. Even if Lee Sin isn't bot, it's more value.
[16712.33s -> 16714.33s]  Yeah, because he's so low
[16716.45s -> 16718.97s]  Collie is Mia though, so we got to be care I
[16720.65s -> 16723.33s]  Wasted my ult though, which makes me kind of scared
[16723.81s -> 16726.93s]  The other thing that kind of sucks about this is we don't have good vision
[16727.45s -> 16737.45s]  And I can't really help anybody on the map because the same thing is happening as before
[16738.55s -> 16741.59s]  We're like we're missing opportunities to get kills on timers
[16742.15s -> 16746.88s]  I mean the dog lighting guy's playing fine this game
[16746.88s -> 16751.10s]  I think he's trolled a lot like he's he's trolling. This isn't like his best game
[16752.24s -> 16756.38s]  But it's also I don't know why we're getting so tilted around the map right now
[16757.04s -> 16759.98s]  Because if I'm if I'm being honest, we should just win the game off of like
[16761.52s -> 16781.21s]  Being better players, I don't know what this car. This is thinking but do it do it it
[16782.23s -> 16784.23s]  Heartless we can fight we can fight just fight
[16787.08s -> 16789.08s]  Bro, what are we doing?
[16789.08s -> 16798.68s]  I'm losing it man. Ah, no, no, no. I'm tilted. I'm tilted as fuck. He didn't walk in just go on to the Akali shroud, man.
[16800.04s -> 16804.12s]  Well, I just walk a foot to your right and stand on the Akali shroud.
[16804.56s -> 16808.64s]  She just eats your damage like while she's in the shroud. She can't stop that.
[16812.63s -> 16814.63s]  Holy shit. I'm losing my minds.
[16815.23s -> 16820.90s]  Like Ash is just inting bot waves right now not trying to do anything.
[16820.90s -> 16829.30s]  Wax is really far up on CS, which is really good, but I'm losing it, man.
[16829.30s -> 16831.96s]  We see exactly where they are every game.
[16831.96s -> 16835.88s]  We see where everybody is on the enemy team permanently, and we still can't manage to
[16835.88s -> 16838.30s]  walk to the right location.
[16838.30s -> 16844.62s]  This is driving me crazy.
[16844.62s -> 16847.44s]  My Karthus jungle is getting out farmed.
[16847.44s -> 16850.28s]  A Karthus jungle is getting out farmed by a Lee Sin jungle.
[16850.28s -> 16852.28s]  That's insane.
[16852.28s -> 16854.92s]  I don't think- I don't think I can stress enough how crazy that is.
[16857.78s -> 16860.66s]  Like there should never be a world where Carthus ever gets out farms.
[16865.63s -> 16866.59s]  No way.
[16867.75s -> 16868.39s]  I'm dead.
[16868.75s -> 16871.47s]  Dude, no way I just fucking ate the end of that.
[16871.79s -> 16872.79s]  Now I'm playing that-
[16872.99s -> 16874.99s]  JUST KILL THE LISEN MAN!
[16884.42s -> 16885.74s]  I fucked up there.
[16887.30s -> 16889.70s]  That was my fault, cause I got hit by the tip of the-
[16890.14s -> 16890.98s]  That was my fault.
[16891.06s -> 16894.70s]  I got barely clipped by the tip of the Niko ult when I was trying to space, cause I'm bad.
[16894.70s -> 16899.08s]  And if I was alive there and I could have saved my flash for the Lee Sin Q we just win
[16899.08s -> 16905.23s]  I am confused that why we decided to like not fight that immediately though
[16906.31s -> 16909.75s]  Like we caught out two of their members and we just got scared for whatever reason
[16910.41s -> 16912.25s]  Wait, we win this fight
[16912.25s -> 16914.25s]  We're thousand percent win this fight this fight this fight this
[16928.68s -> 16931.26s]  Bro do not throw a fucking temper tantrum right now
[16931.86s -> 16934.86s]  There's one kill do not throw a temper tantrum. Oh
[16938.23s -> 16940.23s]  My god, here we go. I
[16940.23s -> 16954.44s]  I took one kill the guy's about to lose his mind guys. I need to mute all I'm gonna mute all in a second
[16955.76s -> 16958.12s]  Like I can't with these people right now
[16961.08s -> 16963.20s]  Like I can't man. You people are disgusting
[16964.68s -> 16966.68s]  Like you guys just
[16966.68s -> 16971.36s]  Wine you play bad you whine and you bitch about every little mistake that everything happens
[16971.52s -> 16973.16s]  Even though it's like in the middle of a fight
[16973.16s -> 16978.56s]  I guarantee I'm a better player than you are and you're still whining and crying over one shutdown that like
[16978.56s -> 16985.28s]  You didn't even walk to until I spam pinged you like I literally 1v2ed them you hit 1e and now you're mad
[16985.76s -> 16990.95s]  Dude, I swear league players are fucking psychopaths
[16991.67s -> 16998.41s]  At least I got the exhaust off surely. She dies, right?
[16999.13s -> 17002.11s]  Surely she dies here or not. Okay
[17003.29s -> 17005.29s]  Okay, at least she died
[17005.93s -> 17007.93s]  Help each other guys
[17008.53s -> 17012.42s]  Help each other teamwork
[17012.42s -> 17020.81s]  Teamwork teamwork teamwork teamwork wait this ash is insane
[17025.75s -> 17031.09s]  Okay, I'm not gonna lie that ash played that so good. I only saw the end of it and she still played that good
[17032.49s -> 17034.49s]  That was sick
[17034.97s -> 17037.33s]  Well well done that was actually really good
[17037.99s -> 17041.88s]  She almost stopped the dive
[17042.16s -> 17052.50s]  That's crazy. This game is definitely 1,000% still winnable though. We just have to play
[17052.50s -> 17057.74s]  Or late game and not lose our fucking minds. I'll let that push back into my ash
[17057.74s -> 17059.74s]  I'll go mid and get some vision
[17062.22s -> 17064.22s]  That's pretty much all we have to do
[17064.66s -> 17066.66s]  Play for late and not lose our mind early
[17066.98s -> 17075.46s]  We could play to kill this Akali right now. She doesn't know there's no ward here
[17076.82s -> 17082.89s]  We could also invade here. Oh, that's so unlucky
[17084.33s -> 17091.70s]  That was such a close queue kill that guy
[17113.74s -> 17120.89s]  Jesus Christ. I feel like we should have won that fight
[17122.05s -> 17124.05s]  I felt like something awkward happened and we lost
[17124.85s -> 17131.69s]  Did my ash just walk directly into the sacali and not use her ulti use your ulti you have ulti use your ulti
[17132.45s -> 17141.84s]  Oh my god
[17141.84s -> 17145.47s]  What the fuck?
[17145.47s -> 17147.47s]  Oh, oh my god. I
[17148.87s -> 17152.51s]  Don't even know what to say right now. This is insane
[17154.23s -> 17159.29s]  This genuinely feels like everybody in the game is losing their mind in the freest game I've ever seen in my life
[17163.62s -> 17166.02s]  Like that's what we're losing to right there that guy
[17166.58s -> 17169.82s]  The guy who like doesn't understand how Senna works
[17170.46s -> 17174.16s]  Like that player. That's why I'm frustrated like that player right there
[17175.06s -> 17177.06s]  Has no idea how Senna works
[17177.46s -> 17179.22s]  Tries to fight me
[17179.22s -> 17181.22s]  And we're like losing to that guy
[17181.50s -> 17185.62s]  Like I'm trying really hard not to be an asshole, but like it's flooding out right now from these games
[17187.90s -> 17192.28s]  It's crazy
[17192.28s -> 17197.22s]  But he's so toxic look at this he went proto belt I only a boot
[17199.80s -> 17221.46s]  Niko but like what that doesn't do anything to help his team you could arrow that guy. I mean it's not impossible
[17223.22s -> 17225.22s]  Or don't that's fine. Oh
[17236.03s -> 17242.85s]  my god
[17242.85s -> 17245.05s]  Guys, I think my luck since AFK
[17247.87s -> 17250.35s]  She's been in sitting in base for like five minutes. I
[17256.43s -> 17257.93s]  think she's like
[17257.93s -> 17261.97s]  It literally just rolling there some chips. All right, let's push this wave
[17262.85s -> 17275.18s]  We could make a pick right now
[17280.18s -> 17283.30s]  Jax, what are you doing, man? Why are you up there? Oh, no
[17285.57s -> 17288.69s]  Also, why does this ash have the worst build I've ever seen?
[17295.70s -> 17298.66s]  Dude, if we lose to the kaisa that just did that I'm gonna lose my mind
[17299.46s -> 17318.54s]  But that guy just blind art in without any vision of anybody and just died
[17319.34s -> 17321.34s]  There's no way we can lose this
[17324.28s -> 17326.28s]  We got this guy's just play
[17326.28s -> 17334.37s]  Like I just need to I need help getting vision control on Baron and mid and then we can we can win
[17335.23s -> 17336.79s]  We got this
[17336.79s -> 17418.71s]  Right now. I mean we still got Baron, but he did get two of them. I guess
[17419.23s -> 17423.06s]  Or no, we only yeah, you got a card this an ash
[17424.42s -> 17434.89s]  But we did get Baron which is very nice. So I'm gonna go Dom's this game
[17435.67s -> 17437.67s]  normally go
[17437.67s -> 17441.17s]  Black Cleaver, but I think I'm gonna go Dom's.
[17441.17s -> 17470.73s]  I need to get vision control on dragon and mid.
[17470.73s -> 17473.49s]  I need to get vision control and I need help to do it though.
[17473.49s -> 17484.10s]  I'm gonna act like I'm backing here.
[17484.10s -> 17485.66s]  We should just be pushing mid with Baron.
[17485.66s -> 17488.62s]  I don't know what we're doing.
[17488.62s -> 17491.94s]  Like Loki, it should just be straight up like we go mid with Baron here.
[17491.94s -> 17504.01s]  What the fuck was that?
[17504.01s -> 17522.42s]  That was a terrible play.
[17522.42s -> 17523.42s]  Guys just come mid.
[17523.42s -> 17524.42s]  We have Baron.
[17524.42s -> 17534.60s]  Nice.
[17534.60s -> 17552.30s]  pick push mid push mid fuck dragon just push mid okay now we back off oh I mean
[17552.30s -> 17561.84s]  that was bad guys back off back off back off leave leave leave please please
[17561.84s -> 17573.48s]  just leave guys you can leave you can leave we just go do dragon leave we
[17573.48s -> 17577.48s]  still have so much gold to get on the map we can go get bot tier 2 bot tier 1
[17577.48s -> 17581.24s]  bot tier 2 we have we have so much gold to get on the map it's not a big
[17581.24s -> 17584.70s]  deal right like we don't need to end the game right the seconds we actually have
[17584.70s -> 17620.68s]  Carthus and we have Jax too so like our scaling is really good I need to go get
[17620.68s -> 17639.44s]  I need to go get my next item but I need enough gold to do it I also need to
[17639.44s -> 17643.38s]  go get wards this sucks I'm on like a weird buy timer where like I don't have
[17643.38s -> 17648.58s]  enough things to get you know what I'm just gonna get my ward item I'm gonna
[17648.58s -> 17651.12s]  Grab this for now just so we can actually get some power on the map
[17651.80s -> 17656.90s]  Because the map's so dark and I think getting the word item before finishing my last whisper items probably the smartest call
[17656.90s -> 17666.60s]  I am a little concerned why we're not pushing bot with Jax. We're pushing top
[17668.36s -> 17670.36s]  And I'm also concerned why we're not
[17671.08s -> 17674.32s]  Playing for mid Pryo, and we're just farming bot side
[17675.76s -> 17677.76s]  This is such an awkward fucking thing
[17684.04s -> 17686.88s]  Like we should just be playing for mid Pryo and use arrow to engage
[17686.88s -> 17690.42s]  That's how we win. We just use arrow to engage when they contest mid
[17691.20s -> 17699.38s]  It's actually that easy
[17699.38s -> 17701.38s]  Like low-key. It's actually that easy
[17708.02s -> 17718.71s]  See watch now this guy's dead. I mean, that's fine with me
[17720.23s -> 17722.39s]  You guys want to ain't to kill me. That's totally fine
[17723.35s -> 17738.16s]  They can get the inhib and then they can back up
[17739.32s -> 17741.32s]  Yeah, yeah, get in here back up and
[17742.12s -> 17744.12s]  Then play for play for Baron
[17744.40s -> 17748.72s]  They'll only have a few seconds to do this though
[17748.72s -> 17751.24s]  So it's kind of scary because these two are gonna be alive
[17752.44s -> 17759.21s]  They need to back immediately
[17759.65s -> 17766.01s]  Just reset. You don't need the wave just leave leave leave
[17766.61s -> 17769.03s]  Barons up burns up think about the macro as the macro
[17769.85s -> 17771.53s]  We play for Baron now
[17771.53s -> 17780.14s]  Because there's a timer now where like you guys just need to reset because there's a timer where the enemy has tempo on the map
[17780.14s -> 17782.14s]  and if we don't
[17782.68s -> 17784.68s]  If we don't allow
[17785.36s -> 17788.50s]  If we don't reset they'll just rush Baron and there's nothing we can do about it
[17788.50s -> 17803.11s]  Okay, they're not on Baron. I think they missed their timer. They're on it. No, no, they're on it. They're on it. They're on it.
[17805.36s -> 17807.36s]  Okay, they're not on it. We're fun.
[17807.36s -> 17815.01s]  We can still fight this though, but we need everybody here.
[17815.61s -> 17826.94s]  Just arrow. Arrow, Ash. Arrow. Arrow. Arrow. It doesn't matter if you hit mouth. Just arrow.
[17827.54s -> 17829.14s]  Just arrow him.
[17829.14s -> 17836.02s]  Thank you.
[17836.02s -> 17838.02s]  No, no, guys. The back line. The back line.
[17840.88s -> 17842.88s]  Play together. Play together. Yes!
[17845.22s -> 17848.78s]  Nice!
[17848.78s -> 17850.18s]  End of the game.
[17850.18s -> 17854.07s]  You end you end here
[17854.47s -> 17856.31s]  Lux don't back
[17856.31s -> 17860.51s]  You are giving me cancer. Okay. They forfeit it dude. Look how easy that is
[17860.71s -> 17867.03s]  Look how easy it is to win games when people are listening to macro. Look how easy it is. Oh my god
[17868.87s -> 17873.55s]  I'm losing it man. I swear to God. I'm losing my hair. I could feel my hair falling out right now
[17873.55s -> 17878.91s]  I can feel it falling out of my fucking head like I just lost the one that's right there look like it's just
[17878.91s -> 17881.91s]  Fuckin' kill me, man.
[17881.91s -> 17883.91s]  In game. God.
[17883.91s -> 17887.91s]  It's so hard. I feel so exhausted.
[17887.91s -> 17889.91s]  Like, it's so exhausting.
[17889.91s -> 17898.10s]  You played a 44 minute gold game? God. Damn.
[17898.10s -> 17903.34s]  That's impressive.
[17903.34s -> 17905.34s]  I don't want to honor any of these people.
[17905.34s -> 17907.34s]  Who would you guys honor?
[17907.34s -> 17909.34s]  Like, out of all of them, who would you guys pick?
[17909.34s -> 17910.34s]  Cause I don't know. They all suck.
[17910.34s -> 17916.06s]  In my eyes, I'm too toxic right now. They all suck.
[17916.06s -> 17920.01s]  Jacks? Alright, I'll give it to Jacks.
[17920.01s -> 17927.88s]  Ash? Ash was trying. I'll give you that. Ash was trying. Dude, look at this Lux.
[17929.06s -> 17939.51s]  This Lux got so fucking carried. Oh my god. Oh my god.
[17940.91s -> 17944.63s]  Don't type to me! You pedestrian!
[17945.27s -> 17950.95s]  This man called him a pedestrian!
[17959.02s -> 17961.02s]  That's not even an insult!
[17961.64s -> 17965.78s]  Like, oh yeah, yeah, wow. Fucking pedestrian! Like,
[17969.78s -> 17971.78s]  that's not even an insult, man!
[17971.78s -> 17995.26s]  dude guys I feel like part of my life gets taken away you know like when I
[17995.26s -> 17998.92s]  play in my main account I'm like super sweaty tryharding and shit I feel like I
[17998.92s -> 18002.30s]  feel like I'm losing like yeah it's like it's like every time I lose it's like
[18002.30s -> 18006.18s]  one hair or like every time I'm like barely win right it's just like every
[18006.18s -> 18010.30s]  game in this he knows like one hair on my head gets fucking burnt out and just
[18010.30s -> 18033.77s]  leaves and I'm not gonna be looking like Homer Simpson like look at the
[18033.77s -> 18038.65s]  difference in wards placed this is what annoys me about bad support players this
[18038.65s -> 18044.21s]  guy plays 23 he's more focused on getting kills than placing wards and it's
[18044.21s -> 18053.64s]  really stupid sorry I just don't listen I don't have anything against the dog
[18053.64s -> 18057.84s]  lightning guy as a person other than like what I've seen on his stream right
[18057.84s -> 18064.04s]  like on his stream he just seems really egotistical like he's like
[18064.04s -> 18070.12s]  everything I hate in the average league player. He has a massive ego because he
[18070.12s -> 18074.78s]  reached challenger on the support role on like an off meta pick like last year at
[18074.78s -> 18077.24s]  some point or something or maybe he's challenger right now I don't even know
[18077.24s -> 18081.88s]  maybe he has an account in challenger I don't even know but it drives me crazy
[18081.88s -> 18088.36s]  because like he doesn't do anything correctly like he gets away with such
[18088.36s -> 18093.08s]  dumb shit because he like he like basically wins lane because he plays
[18093.08s -> 18098.74s]  extremely aggressively. But if you guys noticed in that game, the reason we won lane, or we
[18098.74s -> 18104.72s]  were able to push back, is because they played aggressively, but they did it really stupidly.
[18104.72s -> 18108.92s]  Like they were fighting us in our own waves. Right? Like on repeat, they were just fighting
[18108.92s -> 18114.54s]  us in our own waves. Every time I would just turn a 1 for 1, almost a 1 for 2 every time.
[18114.54s -> 18117.54s]  And it's stupid because every time that's happening, they're also giving me souls,
[18117.54s -> 18121.66s]  right? And he would like take weird fights and like, I know he's probably 4th funding,
[18121.66s -> 18124.74s]  doesn't care it's a smurf blah blah blah but I just don't like when people
[18124.74s -> 18130.54s]  like that like ego their ass off when they play so badly it drives me crazy
[18130.54s -> 18160.50s]  why do I care so much I don't know I don't know how you guys doing by the way
[18160.50s -> 18165.62s]  how's everybody's day going in chat what you guys up to talk to me I know I
[18165.62s -> 18168.82s]  stopped like teaching the game and started whining like I got on my main
[18168.82s -> 18172.02s]  account a few hours ago and I stopped teaching and I started whining a bunch
[18172.02s -> 18179.29s]  So my bad my bad on that one dudes
[18179.97s -> 18182.09s]  How you guys doing now? How's everybody's day gone?
[18189.26s -> 18192.66s]  When the coaching surface is open? Oh, I could probably do coaching
[18193.50s -> 18195.50s]  at some point soon
[18195.74s -> 18199.96s]  Like I'd be willing to do some coaching some like sub coaching or something or like
[18200.54s -> 18211.72s]  Something like that. It might be fun
[18211.76s -> 18214.76s]  So I mean bronze you don't get enough time to actually improve dude. I feel that man
[18214.76s -> 18219.20s]  It takes a long time. Well, you guys not an easy game to pick up and start playing right?
[18219.20s -> 18223.48s]  Like if you're if you're in bronze or silver and you're like, oh, I actually you know, I'm having fun playing the game
[18223.48s -> 18228.76s]  I kind of want to try and get better. It's you're just overwhelmed with so much info that you like have to play so many games
[18229.88s -> 18231.88s]  Right like I feel you man
[18231.92s -> 18245.12s]  Like it's it's overwhelming
[18245.32s -> 18257.38s]  Yeah, I I feel you well. We got mid. Okay
[18259.14s -> 18260.54s]  So I just play trust
[18260.54s -> 18266.44s]  I'm worried if I picked trust that we won't have AP but I
[18266.96s -> 18270.56s]  Also think I'm better at Trist than I am at like other stuff
[18270.64s -> 18284.51s]  So I don't know. AP Verus? I'm not good enough at AP Verus, man. I'm gonna be real.
[18284.51s -> 18291.16s]  Well, my mouse is good, but the problem with mouse is like mouse is a shitty champion.
[18291.16s -> 18298.64s]  Like mouse is trash, right? So like, he's good, but he's like not good in the sense of like,
[18298.64s -> 18303.16s]  I can play him well. But at the end of the day, if they pick something that like,
[18303.16s -> 18312.90s]  like counters mells I just lose. Or is like Tristana just free to pick. Like even if we
[18312.90s -> 18317.26s]  play all AD, let's say we do all AD or some shit like on accidents or because people
[18317.26s -> 18322.90s]  are one treks blah blah blah, it's still free. Like Tristana is still like a good pick.
[18322.90s -> 18328.04s]  Cause even with all AD she's still like you can build Lord Dom's. She has incredibly
[18328.04s -> 18331.46s]  high pressure early game if you play her right. Like you could push the waves,
[18331.46s -> 18337.14s]  You can you can roam top room bot help lanes out like level 2 3 you can invade junglers early
[18337.38s -> 18339.38s]  Like she's just incredibly incredibly strong
[18339.86s -> 18343.37s]  This guy should go pike
[18343.81s -> 18349.33s]  I was gonna say they picked new new and I picked an 80 mid they picked new new and Thresh
[18350.13s -> 18352.13s]  We should have an engage
[18352.13s -> 18357.61s]  Cuz cuz pike Trist like I can just walk bot on repeat now and pretty much kill people
[18367.74s -> 18371.78s]  Watch an iron game watching an iron game. I feel like it wouldn't be an actual iron game though
[18371.78s -> 18379.03s]  I've heard I had friends who I can intentionally lost a bunch of games
[18380.51s -> 18387.87s]  And so they could get to iron for right they like they like into down to iron for whatever to see if they could make it and
[18391.33s -> 18398.95s]  There's just so many like smurfs in iron there's like legitimate bot bot accounts
[18400.47s -> 18402.71s]  Like like accounts that are like being bodied
[18402.71s -> 18406.73s]  right there's like bought of the counts and iron there's like smurfs all over
[18406.73s -> 18419.80s]  the place it seems it stops I wonder if riot like did something that stopped the
[18419.80s -> 18424.16s]  bots they must they may have like they may have just think incorporated
[18424.16s -> 18431.48s]  something that like stops the software but I don't know I haven't heard
[18431.48s -> 18460.31s]  anything about it but I have no clue I'll be real I don't know you had to
[18460.31s -> 18465.15s]  take fall you around last game I got boots one dude that sounds awful I
[18465.15s -> 18472.71s]  I kind of feel bad for actual iron players who are like
[18474.07s -> 18478.31s]  In iron trying to climb because like that sounds bad
[18478.31s -> 18496.94s]  I do think you can climb obviously out of any illo. It doesn't matter right like if I were to go into an iron game
[18496.94s -> 18498.94s]  I'd probably drop like 50 kills
[18498.94s -> 18504.72s]  But I so I do think you can climb out of any you know any illo for sure
[18505.04s -> 18523.68s]  You love only new account a few years ago. You had a bot of the account that answered every time I wrote bot
[18523.68s -> 18544.85s]  That's funny. Yeah, I assume that's a good point. I guess if you're in iron you could like play to learn the game a bit better
[18544.85s -> 18548.65s]  And then you could like play a new account and see where you got. Yeah, I know that would work
[18549.65s -> 18560.38s]  That makes sense. Sure. I'll first pick man. I'll first pick Senna. I
[18563.76s -> 18567.72s]  Guarantee they walk in fucking these people are gonna walk in fucking
[18568.40s -> 18570.40s]  Nautilus or some shits
[18570.40s -> 18573.60s]  It'll be like Jarvan, Nautilus.
[18573.60s -> 18577.60s]  I don't even know.
[18577.60s -> 18585.96s]  Riven's not too bad for Senna, it's okay to get flanked.
[18585.96s -> 18588.16s]  I actually don't think Riven's too bad right now.
[18588.16s -> 18591.16s]  Maybe all the Riven players I've played against suck, but I don't think she's actually that
[18591.16s -> 18592.16s]  bad.
[18592.16s -> 18595.04s]  I think Riven's like just, you have to position well.
[18595.04s -> 18598.84s]  I think Riven's really broken at abusing positioning.
[18598.84s -> 18601.04s]  That's why she's so good in solo queue.
[18601.04s -> 18606.64s]  good Riven players all get really gross flanks and the flanks are what's OP. Yeah, there's the
[18606.64s -> 18612.66s]  Gragas, okay. I was like they're gonna pick something to fuck me over. This guy picked Gragas,
[18612.66s -> 18617.38s]  but it was gonna be like J4 or Gragas or something. And then this guy is the support,
[18617.38s -> 18623.70s]  he'll probably pick Nautilus. Unless he's a one trick, right? Like unless this guy's
[18623.70s -> 18630.26s]  straight up just like a one trick, he'll pick like Nautilus or some shits. Maybe Rakan,
[18630.26s -> 18642.95s]  Recon or Nautilus. Because if he picks an Enchanter we just win the game. He has to pick Engage.
[18647.40s -> 18652.92s]  Mirio would be really good here too, actually. Because Mirio would counter half our team.
[18653.56s -> 18660.68s]  You can Mirio Q, Wukong, and Kennen Engage. Like if this guy played Mirio, this would actually be a
[18660.68s -> 18676.13s]  hardland. Tom Kinch? I mean I get it but I think it's bad. Rins? Oh shit. Yo you just
[18676.13s -> 18683.49s]  saved me looking like an absolute fool. Thank you. Holy crap. If you wanted to see my rinse
[18683.49s -> 18685.53s]  there here but thank you you reminded me. Here I'm gonna be over here I'm gonna get
[18685.53s -> 18729.67s]  some water. I'll be right back. Get some agua. By the way the people who are here
[18729.67s -> 18738.11s]  to watch me play AD carry? I sincerely apologize. I know watching me play Senna is probably boring
[18738.11s -> 18749.24s]  as fuck. Okay? I know. And I promise you, we will play AD carry at some point. I promise
[18749.24s -> 18753.40s]  you. I played like the first four hours of the stream was AD carry or the first three.
[18753.40s -> 18756.36s]  Right? I played on my smurf for a few games and played some AD. So if you want to
[18756.36s -> 18761.76s]  watch that, you can go back in the bot. We did some of my commentary and shit. The
[18761.76s -> 18767.24s]  The only reason I'm playing so much Senna and support on this account is because the
[18767.24s -> 18773.32s]  elo I'm currently in is the worst elo to climb in solo queue because of a lot of factors
[18773.32s -> 18777.60s]  and support has some of the highest impact on the game.
[18777.60s -> 18784.52s]  Whereas ADC has high impact late, but in solo queue you want to have high impact early
[18784.52s -> 18810.36s]  and I wanted to be able to impact the game early on.
[18810.36s -> 18820.84s]  So yeah, sorry about being boring and shit.
[18820.84s -> 18825.48s]  I just really want to like win games at least on this accounts.
[18825.48s -> 18845.56s]  I want to get out of the silo because the faster I get out of the silo, the faster I can have
[18845.56s -> 18849.76s]  fun playing AD carry and like trying to climb.
[18849.76s -> 18854.96s]  What a weird, like what a weird play by these guys, what the fuck?
[18854.96s -> 18861.88s]  They like half shoved the waves to get like early bush control and then they do shit
[18861.88s -> 18872.19s]  like that.
[18872.19s -> 18874.19s]  This guy's just dead. I'm gonna give it to twitch
[18878.28s -> 18880.06s]  Nice we got his exhaust
[18880.06s -> 18884.42s]  So I wasted my exhaust there. I did it because I thought the jinx was gonna insta flash
[18886.38s -> 18888.90s]  Like I didn't exhaust because I was like scared of her damage I
[18889.42s -> 18893.04s]  Did it because I thought she was gonna like try and flash away the second that's
[18894.86s -> 18897.58s]  But I landed my snare it was kind of bad by me
[18897.58s -> 18901.02s]  I mean I landed my snare so I didn't need to exhaust her. I just was like oh, maybe she'll flash
[18901.72s -> 18903.72s]  She did not she did not flash
[18903.72s -> 18913.28s]  What do you know is this 500 LP Masters 400 LP insane I know absolutely crazy
[18913.28s -> 18949.36s]  put that word there because Gragas is probably bought so they're trying to come
[18949.36s -> 18954.96s]  up from bot to kill me here like their bot names rotating up to try and kill
[18954.96s -> 18963.52s]  me so just be careful twitch they're there in here man I actually have to back
[18963.52s -> 18976.20s]  and walk look this is hilarious the enemy bot lane literally is roaming mid look
[18976.20s -> 18991.57s]  at this what why I'm not trying to soak his XP I just want those souls I'm scared
[18991.57s -> 19007.03s]  to walk in here I don't know where Gragas is I gotta come bot to help my
[19007.03s -> 19013.09s]  twitch so they don't freeze the wave like I don't want them to be able to
[19013.09s -> 19020.63s]  freeze here even if Gragas ganks we win we win the fight right now like
[19020.63s -> 19023.87s]  it's an easy fight when as long as we don't get knocked up we just win the
[19023.87s -> 19045.20s]  fight automatically. Actually we're trying to bait Gragas to come gank this. Easy. Double
[19045.20s -> 19068.74s]  flashes baby. Easy. You fucking cowards. We should back up. I can go buy now. Oh Gragas
[19068.74s -> 19075.14s]  is top. We could actually maybe do dragon. Yo I'm gonna be real. A-Soul roaming is
[19075.14s -> 19081.68s]  not in like the top list of me being like nervous about it. Like I'm not nervous
[19081.68s -> 19090.56s]  about a soul roaming men push this so we can oh we're diving them that's a bit
[19090.56s -> 19096.14s]  scary welcome to the league of Draven good to see your back to enjoying the
[19096.14s -> 19101.48s]  game whoa we're going still diving that that's not good like we back off here man
[19101.48s -> 19116.72s]  I mean we can maybe go up here if you really want to I kind of award this I
[19116.72s -> 19134.09s]  need to reset though really badly right now really badly not being on the
[19134.09s -> 19140.49s]  map here is really bad or rather not like having gold spent and being on the
[19140.49s -> 19144.61s]  map is what I meant to say like it's really fucking bad. Yo back up you know
[19144.61s -> 19149.27s]  Gragas that you watched him walk past three wards that's why I just warded
[19149.27s -> 19156.13s]  no no he's still here. Gragas is right there. We know Gragas is somewhere
[19156.13s -> 19164.43s]  bot lane right now I don't know where but we know he's there. They're on
[19164.43s -> 19167.87s]  dragon okay we can fight this go go go
[19167.87s -> 19188.67s]  W over I'm here nice yo come here y'all
[19188.67s -> 19190.65s]  help you come get this mother first
[19190.65s -> 19219.94s]  blue I got you baby what the fuck made
[19219.94s -> 19230.58s]  a bitch well I guess I'll back yo
[19230.58s -> 19232.34s]  Spartan thank you for the six months
[19232.34s -> 19236.38s]  man welcome back appreciate it this
[19236.38s -> 19243.18s]  we'll back we'll get our fucking umbral I'm gonna go top side of the map now and
[19243.18s -> 19247.58s]  I'm gonna help my team get ref taralds I'm gonna ping I want to go top side I
[19247.58s -> 19258.36s]  want to help my team get refs the wave if we look at bot wave it's pushing into
[19258.36s -> 19265.12s]  us it's totally fine okay twitches level six the bot waves pushing in we
[19265.12s -> 19274.61s]  are totally fine to do what I'm doing right now he doesn't know I'm
[19274.61s -> 19302.29s]  here I'm dead though row no joke I almost juked that that's so close I was
[19302.29s -> 19308.09s]  hoping like Wukong for some reason didn't walk topside but the enemy bot lane
[19308.09s -> 19315.85s]  dead okay the enemy bot lane just griefed their entire game the game's
[19315.85s -> 19322.95s]  over we win what the fuck are they do what is happening like my twitch is
[19322.95s -> 19342.76s]  is getting free plates wait you guys are griefing I'm griefing dude what the
[19342.76s -> 19352.68s]  fuck we why would you fight them guys guys guys wukong wukong okay we see that
[19352.68s -> 19357.64s]  our twitch is getting free plates bot free first turret okay I'm backed I almost
[19357.64s -> 19363.96s]  sold their ad carry okay or their jungler why would you ever on purpose
[19363.96s -> 19369.96s]  Take a fight like that with no- oh, I have cancer.
[19369.96s -> 19373.12s]  Also, the Wukong's an idiot.
[19373.12s -> 19375.56s]  He doesn't understand macro at all, apparently.
[19375.56s -> 19378.52s]  Because I literally pinged to come to Rift.
[19378.52s -> 19383.56s]  My Wukong was like nervous.
[19383.56s -> 19385.48s]  For some reason Wukong didn't walk top.
[19385.48s -> 19387.60s]  He sat bot trying to gank.
[19387.60s -> 19394.08s]  But the objective was Rift, not- God, I'm losing my mind in this elo.
[19394.08s -> 19400.08s]  players are literally just diamond players with slightly better mechanics they don't know anything
[19400.08s -> 19406.70s]  about the game and I'm about to my brain's about to explode like a peanut it's not about them laning
[19406.70s -> 19414.30s]  2v2 you fucking cumquat dude I know they can't lane against this 2v2 it's not about the 2v2 man
[19414.30s -> 19419.26s]  we we get a free rift herald because uh we shut down their bot lane and I'm on an item spike
[19419.26s -> 19428.27s]  so we just automatically get a free rift it has nothing to do with 2v2 this cumquat motherfucker
[19428.75s -> 19437.11s]  I don't know why that's my insult the pedestrian guy got to me
[19439.31s -> 19440.67s]  Somehow
[19440.67s -> 19449.36s]  Where the fuck is this war? Oh?
[19450.12s -> 19460.68s]  Because I'm telling you right now my macro there was a hundred percent correct by the way like 1,000 percent
[19471.09s -> 19475.45s]  Like even though I died. I know it was correct. No. No, just do a dragon. Do not die
[19476.41s -> 19479.85s]  Guys, we don't have to not everything's about kills not everything's about kills. We got this
[19481.05s -> 19483.05s]  Like you don't need to die if you don't need to dive always
[19483.05s -> 19490.09s]  You don't need to see a kill be like ooh monkey kill brain go like the game is about like getting objectives on timers and
[19490.33s -> 19492.33s]  Playing off of tempo and things like that
[19492.81s -> 19497.65s]  Like the only reason we even lost rift was because my wukong went full monkey brain
[19497.65s -> 19501.99s]  And it was like no we need to not play for this rift with a giant massive lead
[19522.28s -> 19528.31s]  Wait kill this guy
[19528.31s -> 19530.31s]  What am I watching right now?
[19530.31s -> 19538.81s]  This is outrageous. My Wukong just solo ulted there. Dude, I'm gonna lose it. My Wukong just solo ulted their Gragas
[19539.39s -> 19551.40s]  On a good note though
[19551.92s -> 19554.80s]  They don't get any plates off of rifting so it's not that bad
[19556.52s -> 19562.43s]  Okay, man, just push like dude hit the minions like stop my bad
[19563.73s -> 19567.53s]  Sorry, I'm wound up right now. Kenan. Okay. I'm gonna want
[19568.57s -> 19570.57s]  Apologies if I if I griefed you man
[19572.17s -> 19574.17s]  It's fine
[19574.39s -> 19576.39s]  So the wound up it's fine. I
[19576.93s -> 19579.59s]  Just don't like when like stuff like that happens
[19579.59s -> 19586.01s]  I'm a perfectionist and it's my big place. I talk about this earlier. I'm a perfectionist my biggest flaw is that like I will
[19587.09s -> 19590.33s]  Play the game 100% correctly on like tempo and timers
[19590.33s -> 19594.81s]  But you can't do that because you got to remember to like your teammates or teammates
[19598.36s -> 19601.92s]  Like they're not just gonna instantly know exactly what you're what what to do
[19601.92s -> 19616.75s]  We win that guy don't just stand here and watch me die man
[19617.87s -> 19619.87s]  Holy shit
[19623.45s -> 19628.05s]  That is oh my god. If he if he had let me die there. I might have screamed
[19629.25s -> 19631.69s]  Actually screamed out loud in anger
[19632.83s -> 19638.71s]  Like dude is watching me kite these people within one inch of my life and
[19639.89s -> 19642.63s]  Instead of like helping or walking up and doing anything. You know what he does
[19645.13s -> 19647.13s]  He pulls a fucking gross score
[19647.13s -> 19652.11s]  My man just likes to watch.
[19652.11s -> 19672.08s]  Something wrong with it, but, you know, there's a time and a place.
[19672.08s -> 19675.08s]  I don't actually want to buy pinks, because I don't think we're strong enough that, uh...
[19675.08s -> 19679.08s]  I don't think that we're strong enough that I can actually even defend the pinks right now, if I'm being honest.
[19679.08s -> 19684.08s]  Like, we should be strong enough, but we kind of throw a lead when I overforced the rift.
[19684.08s -> 19692.08s]  So I think... I think...
[19692.08s -> 19700.88s]  We need to push this wave so that we can get tempo and move around the map.
[19700.88s -> 19712.16s]  prior sorry I keep saying the wrong thing uh-oh that guy's dead I have to ditch that guy
[19713.44s -> 19719.52s]  he's dead as fuck oh i'm dead too maybe oh i am so dead yeah that was my bad
[19720.40s -> 19724.80s]  that was my bad my bad my bad like I we just got we just got ran down that was on me
[19727.86s -> 19734.26s]  like we we had good positioning but um the jungler wasn't uh close enough so this is my bed
[19734.26s -> 19740.30s]  I also didn't expect to get fucking four man's, but I should have right
[19740.94s -> 19747.53s]  We should play for this though. I wish I could type. I wish I wasn't chat restricted for a year
[19749.13s -> 19751.81s]  Dude, I swear to God. I'm not even being mean
[19752.61s -> 19758.37s]  Like riot was like they chat restricted me because I type so much macro that it gets on people's nerves
[19758.37s -> 19779.71s]  And they don't want me spam typing low key. Don't play rip. Don't play for refs. I need help guys
[19779.71s -> 19781.71s]  If you guys can help
[19781.71s -> 19800.55s]  We need the clear vision on dragon a year. Yeah, I get uncharted April 15th or April 11th or some shit
[19801.95s -> 19803.45s]  2024
[19803.45s -> 19808.31s]  Yeah, I've never seen it. It must have been like an actual rioter or something
[19808.55s -> 19814.99s]  Like I've never seen an automated system give you a year chat restricts, right? So in my mind, it's got to be like an actual like
[19817.54s -> 19819.54s]  Like a rioter was like Dronemo
[19819.54s -> 19823.28s]  We know you're good enough to climb but stop typing
[19824.70s -> 19836.17s]  You know I mean that's like what must have been going on and I'm like okay well sure I
[19851.88s -> 19853.88s]  Mean, I didn't know you could get chat band a year
[19854.48s -> 19857.44s]  What's weird is like I said, I don't like say trigger words
[19857.44s -> 19859.54s]  It's not like I tell people to like end themselves and stuff
[19860.00s -> 19865.04s]  It's mainly just me typing like go here do that do this like I type a lot, right?
[19865.28s -> 19869.08s]  Which is obviously like if you type a lot it can be toxic as well, so
[19872.82s -> 19874.82s]  Like typing a lot's annoying so I get it
[19886.23s -> 19889.39s]  We should be playing for baron side vision right now not
[19890.53s -> 19893.41s]  The vision we're playing with right now is bad. We should be playing over here
[19895.13s -> 19899.19s]  Like I want to play for Baron vision, but it's a little hard to do that right now
[19899.83s -> 19907.92s]  Because you see how Tom Kenshin me are like transferring vision control around the map right now
[19908.40s -> 19912.08s]  We're playing this little support game of like hide the vision
[19913.48s -> 19915.32s]  Look at this fuck
[19915.32s -> 19918.76s]  Look at this motherfucker
[19918.96s -> 19961.45s]  Oh, he's so dumb. I still think he's dumb. How did I just take tonight? I took my entire
[19961.45s -> 19970.28s]  HP bar on a global. My bad. Dude, I really wish the mouth fight would group though. I get
[19970.28s -> 19974.36s]  that he's like doing the thing where he's like, oh, let's, you know, split. Like his
[19974.36s -> 19977.04s]  His play was actually really smart there.
[19977.04s -> 19978.76s]  The Malphite's play, I mean.
[19978.76s -> 19981.34s]  That wasn't his fault that we got shit on at all.
[19981.34s -> 19985.20s]  I just wish that he would group because if he groups up and hits R, we win every team
[19985.20s -> 19986.72s]  fight.
[19986.72s -> 19989.92s]  Because right now our only frontliner is the Wukong, right?
[19989.92s -> 19992.88s]  And the fact that Wukong's our frontliner, we don't have the ability to play the
[19992.88s -> 19993.88s]  game.
[19993.88s -> 19996.16s]  When did I get stuck on that?
[19996.16s -> 19998.68s]  What the fuck was that?
[19998.68s -> 20003.52s]  That TomKinch getting to E forward like that blindly into our entire team and
[20003.52s -> 20005.14s]  and then not getting punished for it.
[20005.14s -> 20008.08s]  Might be the most solo queue thing I've ever seen.
[20008.08s -> 20010.48s]  Nobody wanted to hit him because he was the tank,
[20010.48s -> 20015.32s]  but yeah, we should still kill him, you know?
[20021.21s -> 20022.65s]  We can fight this guy.
[20022.65s -> 20024.53s]  Oh my God, jungler, just come.
[20025.79s -> 20026.63s]  Oh, we're forfeiting.
[20026.63s -> 20027.47s]  Oh, okay.
[20027.47s -> 20028.77s]  Now that makes perfect sense, right?
[20030.65s -> 20032.29s]  Just come group.
[20032.29s -> 20033.93s]  Bro, cannon, come group.
[20033.93s -> 20037.49s]  Please guys, I don't know why everybody's frustrated.
[20037.49s -> 20039.49s]  We're literally still up in gold
[20039.73s -> 20041.89s]  Please come group up. We just took an inhibitor
[20042.81s -> 20044.81s]  Just just come group
[20045.77s -> 20048.81s]  Help me get vision on this dragon so that I don't so we don't die
[20049.53s -> 20052.81s]  Like I need my team to actually walk over here to help me get vision
[20053.49s -> 20059.84s]  It's really frustrating because I need the frontliners the wukong in the mouth fight to walk in with me
[20060.48s -> 20064.44s]  Because I'm a little fucking why I have a big gun, but I'm a big gun girl, right?
[20064.64s -> 20068.92s]  So I need I need these two guys to walk in with me these two big burly mountain men
[20074.36s -> 20079.84s]  So that I can play the game, you know know we don't push bot no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[20079.92s -> 20081.72s]  No, me
[20081.72s -> 20083.36s]  is worthless. Come in
[20083.36s -> 20085.76s]  My mouth right pushing the wave that we already have done. I
[20086.42s -> 20088.32s]  Wish I could macro. I
[20088.32s -> 20092.06s]  Wish I could type some macro right now. There. They're like what my team is so lost
[20094.72s -> 20096.94s]  They're so beyond lost right now. It's crazy
[20098.89s -> 20100.73s]  They're lost this shit
[20100.73s -> 20112.34s]  Just do do Dragon? Yes. Just do this just do it. I'll start it for you here you go. I
[20112.34s -> 20116.18s]  I don't know why we're standing in a bush waiting for them to facecheck.
[20116.18s -> 20121.94s]  Two dragon guys.
[20121.94s -> 20125.94s]  I swear to God, you have to do everything in this elo where you have to start every
[20125.94s -> 20126.94s]  fight.
[20126.94s -> 20130.14s]  I have to, basically I have to start every fight, right?
[20130.14s -> 20134.54s]  I have to not only start every fight but I have to like ping my team what to do exactly
[20134.54s -> 20137.84s]  because everybody plays so safe in this elo.
[20137.84s -> 20141.94s]  Why did my mouth fight just stop his back?
[20141.94s -> 20147.55s]  Why are you all fighting?
[20147.55s -> 20153.71s]  My god, please guys it's fine. It's fine fine
[20155.13s -> 20162.63s]  No mouth bite you can't 1v9 that just back off they didn't get anything they didn't get anything we got dragon run dragon soul points
[20164.43s -> 20169.43s]  I'm losing hairs. I'm losing fucking hairs man. I ain't got many hairs to spare anymore
[20169.91s -> 20171.75s]  We're out here losing hair
[20171.75s -> 20180.62s]  It's like I'm babysitting like this has got to be what a preschool teacher feels like you know
[20180.62s -> 20185.92s]  Like low-key like preschool teacher just feels feels like this this has to be it
[20191.18s -> 20194.50s]  Like watch it's like watching a toddler like you watch them from the corner, right?
[20194.50s -> 20196.98s]  And they're like eating glue and you're like
[20197.74s -> 20201.12s]  I mean that's bad and then you tell him like don't eat glue jet don't eat glue Timmy
[20201.12s -> 20206.22s]  And he's like okay, and then like you leave him there for five minutes to go like do something to watch somebody else
[20206.26s -> 20208.82s]  Then all of a sudden Timmy's eating glue again, and you're like bro
[20209.94s -> 20211.42s]  bro
[20211.42s -> 20223.23s]  We just had this discussion, and it's like not Timmy's fault right because he's a toddler
[20224.39s -> 20229.51s]  So you can't be mad at Timmy because he's a toddler you can't but it's like it's frustrating
[20229.51s -> 20241.92s]  It's like god damn it man
[20241.92s -> 20247.32s]  Like what is what is happening like mouth fight just group my mouth fight has a fetish with just pushing bot
[20248.20s -> 20250.20s]  Bro just group and hit R
[20251.24s -> 20255.40s]  Bro, I know you have Bork wait you have Bork
[20255.40s -> 20263.66s]  Wait, I... Bro, we need to be able to engage. We don't win through split.
[20263.66s -> 20266.66s]  Just group up, hit R, and we win.
[20266.66s -> 20270.66s]  Like, I've been controlling the ever-living fuck out of all the vision in this game.
[20270.66s -> 20275.66s]  I feel like I'm doing all of this to control vision and shit, and it still feels like it's not enough.
[20275.66s -> 20277.66s]  It's kind of nuts.
[20277.66s -> 20283.45s]  Loki, it still feels not enough.
[20283.45s -> 20293.11s]  No, don't go bot! Don't go bot! Don't go bot! Don't go bot! Please don't go bot!
[20293.11s -> 20294.11s]  Get me!
[20294.11s -> 20306.55s]  They don't have a ward, they don't know I'm there.
[20306.55s -> 20322.38s]  Well, we're just not going to ult that guy or what?
[20322.38s -> 20324.86s]  This is why we listen.
[20324.86s -> 20330.66s]  Oh my god, I have, I actually just, I'm so, I don't know what to say.
[20330.66s -> 20332.94s]  Like, I literally pinged to come.
[20332.94s -> 20337.38s]  Wukong didn't use ulti, Twitch just died in, and now he's AFK.
[20337.38s -> 20338.38s]  Oh my god.
[20338.38s -> 20339.90s]  Oh my god, kill me in game.
[20339.90s -> 20340.90s]  Kennen and Malfight.

[20341.94s -> 20353.95s]  Bro can we can we like just go in Ken and just ulti

[20394.36s -> 20402.59s]  Dude, I swear to God. Yeah, these people are not real
[20403.39s -> 20408.88s]  Bro, we do not need the mouth fight. I
[20410.16s -> 20412.16s]  Am a higher level than my jungler
[20416.42s -> 20418.66s]  Push mid guys. You got to push mid first
[20419.30s -> 20421.74s]  Listen, homies, you gotta push mid first.
[20425.85s -> 20428.53s]  You know what? Fuck it. Don't even go in. Yeah, fuck it. Push mid.
[20429.53s -> 20430.49s]  We're just gonna end the game.
[20430.93s -> 20433.61s]  If they go for dragon here, we just push. Fuck it.
[20438.81s -> 20441.37s]  That's actually such a good macro call. Not even joking.
[20454.24s -> 20455.76s]  Such a good macro call, actually.
[20461.54s -> 20463.14s]  Everybody just run, though. Just run.
[20464.30s -> 20467.14s]  Don't ulti in. No, guys, we don't fight this.
[20467.90s -> 20469.14s]  Oh, I have cancer.
[20470.26s -> 20471.42s]  We're getting flanked, boys.
[20472.36s -> 20475.88s]  Dude, I have such high levels of cancer right now. You have no idea
[20476.78s -> 20479.40s]  Like high high fucking functioning cancer
[20480.32s -> 20520.05s]  You guys just killed the fucking Gragas. Oh my god. Thank God. Thank God. Just end the game
[20520.97s -> 20523.51s]  Please end the game. Please hit the fucking thing. Oh
[20525.65s -> 20529.93s]  Oh my god, Walter White is like my hero right now
[20529.93s -> 20535.33s]  I don't even understand like I feel like every like I feel like what Walter White felt like
[20535.33s -> 20541.01s]  dealing with Skyler for literally three years like this is outrageous this is
[20541.01s -> 20547.92s]  what this feels like like I I can relate to the show so much more oh my god
[20547.92s -> 20581.86s]  like dude oh crap look at look just look at the like look at like what's
[20581.86s -> 20592.40s]  going on in the game like I I don't even mean to be mean about this it's just
[20592.40s -> 20596.99s]  This is this is crazy
[20596.99s -> 20598.99s]  Mouth fight though popping off
[20599.63s -> 20601.15s]  Mouth fight popping off
[20601.15s -> 20622.48s]  Like what are you guys this guy? Oh, he's literally diamond. Why is this guy in this game? I mean, I feel I feel like
[20623.20s -> 20627.04s]  Confused now. I'm not even blaming the wukong anymore. I don't know why this guy is in the game. Oh
[20628.88s -> 20637.41s]  He hasn't played to that's MMR. Oh, he just has previous season inflated MMR
[20637.89s -> 20640.89s]  That's what the sense because he was GM for three years
[20640.89s -> 20646.61s]  So the his MMR says that he like belongs here even though he doesn't play like I bet you last season
[20646.61s -> 20653.22s]  He only played like 50 games. I can look right we just see like how many games he played
[20653.46s -> 20655.62s]  Yeah, he played what he played like 50 games last season
[20656.30s -> 20659.42s]  So like his MMR didn't really change. He just got masters and then stopped
[20660.82s -> 20672.12s]  Which is fine. There's nothing wrong with that. I just wish he would chill, you know
[20672.12s -> 20674.12s]  Like
[20674.76s -> 20676.76s]  Not rage quit halfway through the game
[20677.28s -> 20682.51s]  Because like I said people's elo and shit used to bother me a lot
[20682.51s -> 20684.79s]  I don't I don't get bothered by it anymore because I realized it was cringe
[20684.79s -> 20688.97s]  I don't care about their elo and shit what I care about is like I just want them to play the game
[20688.97s -> 20689.67s]  You know what I mean?
[20689.67s -> 20695.15s]  Like I just want them to not rage not not like be absolute apes in the game and just play that's all I ask for I
[20695.67s -> 20698.99s]  Don't care if you're a diamond player plot player in the game and you're just like accidentally in the game
[20698.99s -> 20701.15s]  It's not your fault. I just want you to push buttons
[20705.33s -> 20707.49s]  What I'm doing wrong to have a 36% win rate
[20707.69s -> 20714.50s]  I can't see the link because just you'd have to give me your name and your server
[20714.98s -> 20721.83s]  How you guys doing by the way everybody having a good day you guys enjoying the stream having a good time?
[20722.71s -> 20728.79s]  Watching me go bald in live like live time. You guys are like oh look drawn almost going bald live on stream
[20730.95s -> 20733.71s]  It's rough hold on I'm gonna take my pants off
[20771.48s -> 20775.43s]  Dude what I
[20775.47s -> 20777.47s]  Fuck you guys
[20777.47s -> 20780.51s]  They fucking like I get double swapped. Did you guys see that shit?
[20780.63s -> 20783.51s]  Like oh, yeah the support could do it and then he banned Senna. I
[20784.59s -> 20786.59s]  Mean I didn't hover it. So that's my bad
[20787.35s -> 20795.46s]  God damn it. I should have hovered. I was just like taking my pants off and now he wants first pick
[20797.70s -> 20804.07s]  Dude, what oh my god. I hate I don't I don't know. I don't know what to say. This is crazy
[20808.89s -> 20810.89s]  Today's Thursday, right? I
[20811.81s -> 20824.32s]  Am I losing days today's Thursday, right guys? It is okay cool. Oh
[20824.32s -> 20829.32s]  Ah, what do I play? They have Zerath and Zin.
[20829.32s -> 20833.32s]  They have Xayah. I mean I guess I could just play Rakan. It's not a big deal.
[20833.32s -> 20845.39s]  Let's see what their bot lane is though. I actually have to see what their bot lane is to choose my runes.
[20845.39s -> 20850.18s]  Sona? No.
[20850.18s -> 20855.18s]  Oh they have an Ezreal. What the fuck is their team comp?
[20855.18s -> 20859.13s]  Um, okay.
[20859.13s -> 20883.45s]  When you do this build, what's the secondary supposed to be? I think it's supposed to be this.
[20883.45s -> 20892.29s]  Or maybe like revitalize. I just feel like I'm flinching so good. Oh
[20894.82s -> 20896.82s]  They have a support
[20897.18s -> 20900.14s]  Zaraths supports that yeah, okay, so I want I
[20901.06s -> 20903.30s]  Definitely want glacial here, and I want
[20905.26s -> 20909.30s]  Maybe I take a mar actually instead of armor because they have two poke champs
[20910.66s -> 20920.24s]  And I take this yeah, yeah, this is good. Okay. That's not bad. Okay. What's that? I'll be a bit. I need to get some more water
[20968.17s -> 20983.11s]  30 seconds until minion spawn.
[20983.11s -> 20985.11s]  Burnin' in the air.
[20985.11s -> 20987.11s]  Burnin' in the air.
[20987.11s -> 20989.11s]  Oh shit, no, don't flag me.
[20991.11s -> 20992.11s]  Fuck, man, I had a P.
[20993.11s -> 20996.11s]  Don't fucking flag me for AFK, cause I didn't take a week.
[20996.11s -> 20999.68s]  Can you not start with AD carry to move over to support?
[20999.68s -> 21002.68s]  I always fall asleep before the AD carry gameplay.
[21002.68s -> 21003.68s]  Wait, what?
[21003.68s -> 21005.68s]  I fell asleep before AD carry?
[21005.68s -> 21007.68s]  What do you mean?
[21007.68s -> 21011.30s]  Oh, you mean like start with my main and then play
[21013.90s -> 21028.33s]  Yeah, I played 80 carry at the start I should probably
[21029.45s -> 21031.83s]  Play 80 carry more over support
[21033.81s -> 21057.78s]  Later in the stream here, I'll play an 80 carry game after this I feel bad. Oh, it's Gragas
[21057.78s -> 21060.02s]  I thought it was gonna be Zerath, but it's Gragas. I
[21060.02s -> 21068.41s]  I don't want to fight too hard level one even though that guy I should have gone in there. That's my bed
[21068.41s -> 21072.69s]  I want to I want to try and get level two here even though. I think we actually win level one
[21075.70s -> 21079.48s]  Well, I got his bone pointing. Yeah, I should have fought level one. That was my bed
[21080.50s -> 21083.04s]  Because we went very hard level one. I just grieved it
[21084.26s -> 21088.64s]  Like all I have to do there is go in on the Ezreal or the Gragas level one and they can't play the game
[21090.16s -> 21108.50s]  Right, it's not worth it's not worth
[21108.50s -> 21117.93s]  There's no way that I can not get E'd by Gragas there by the way, I don't know if I can flash W there
[21129.08s -> 21131.08s]  Maybe we shouldn't be ego-ing buddy
[21135.88s -> 21139.32s]  Guys just fucking egos in front of me like what?
[21153.01s -> 21155.29s]  Okay, I might have missed everything there, but like
[21157.33s -> 21172.80s]  You know, it's okay. It's a little counterproductive
[21172.80s -> 21174.80s]  productive
[21175.28s -> 21177.96s]  When I take a tower shot to land a Q
[21179.52s -> 21181.52s]  Feels a little counterproductive
[21188.81s -> 21190.47s]  but hey
[21190.47s -> 21195.96s]  I'm gonna back here just in case
[21196.80s -> 21199.16s]  The enemy Zin tries to gank a mid
[21201.79s -> 21203.79s]  Dude, I'm so sad. I can't get boots
[21204.67s -> 21210.69s]  I'm gonna wait
[21210.69s -> 21212.69s]  Yeah, I'm gonna be cringe. I'm gonna wait. I
[21213.21s -> 21217.53s]  Would never wait here normally, but you know what it's just it's so like it's such a big buy. I
[21217.53s -> 21219.05s]  I
[21219.05s -> 21221.05s]  Don't want to I'm I'm ah
[21221.49s -> 21227.45s]  Now that now that I've waited and beat cringe now. I have to sit here and wait. Oh, it's so painful. Okay. I'm on my way
[21228.41s -> 21247.37s]  I'm sorry guys
[21247.37s -> 21254.08s]  We're at the weight. Nah, not at all. I got lucky, but
[21254.90s -> 21269.71s]  You know what's interesting? I'd never use the stupid dematerializer
[21269.71s -> 21274.59s]  I think I should have like I should use it on every cannon or some shit, but I just don't do it
[21275.15s -> 21278.13s]  Because I know the reason you're supposed to use it is because it helps you push
[21278.79s -> 21281.59s]  Because you can do materialize the cannon right and just instead yeah
[21282.39s -> 21285.71s]  So you're supposed to use it because it's like a really fast way to push but it's also a I
[21302.94s -> 21309.38s]  Should not have W'd fuck. I won't not the Gragas anyway. I fucked up. I shouldn't have W the Gragas
[21309.38s -> 21312.71s]  I should play it slower
[21312.71s -> 21314.71s]  This guy's gonna die. Oh
[21317.31s -> 21319.35s]  He's gonna die put himself against the wall GG
[21319.35s -> 21323.99s]  That was my fault though 100%
[21327.94s -> 21333.04s]  Cuz if I didn't W in they can't kill us right and Gragas probably dies to the auto attack anyway
[21333.30s -> 21339.22s]  My thought process was Gragas snared so if I W here, but even after like even if I don't get Eed
[21339.22s -> 21341.22s]  I'm pretty confident I die
[21377.41s -> 21388.00s]  Damn it. I tried I was out of everything. I wonder if I could have played that better
[21388.64s -> 21391.48s]  Maybe like if I could have weaved an extra auto in or something
[21394.76s -> 21414.32s]  It's hard to know all right. I'm gonna go mid here. I
[21415.30s -> 21418.76s]  Can't okay
[21418.76s -> 21422.40s]  What could go mid, but I think I I think I want to sit bot for a bit and get some XP
[21422.40s -> 21430.95s]  I think it's smarter to do that at this point. I think we should push this
[21430.95s -> 21450.20s]  I don't want to W in because I know Zen's area
[21451.70s -> 21470.87s]  That's why I didn't want to W because I know Zen's here. They were just making it so obvious right like that
[21470.87s -> 21472.87s]  it was like
[21472.87s -> 21477.03s]  Sometimes when people make shit too good to be true, it is too good to be true
[21478.57s -> 21481.67s]  Like oh shit, we're just gonna they're just gonna fight us here cool. Oh
[21483.41s -> 21489.88s]  Yeah, I gotta help him push my bed. I'm playing sloppy
[21515.44s -> 21523.65s]  You just want to see a cool trick watch this she could push the wave and then just min max the back
[21525.33s -> 21527.33s]  How cool was that?
[21527.33s -> 21534.58s]  She just pushes the wave I just back next to the bush and she's just like oh, I guess I'll take the free ride. I
[21534.58s -> 21565.90s]  I really need level six badly like bro. I really cannot get level six right now. This is
[21567.38s -> 21568.62s]  Painful
[21568.62s -> 21576.23s]  Hey kill these maybe I'm six off this. Nope. Guess not. I
[21577.19s -> 21580.59s]  Was gonna stay mid there by the way and help the homie. I
[21581.67s -> 21583.51s]  Need to go mid
[21583.51s -> 21614.41s]  This is so awkward
[21627.81s -> 21635.66s]  Bro help me
[21635.66s -> 21641.14s]  Bro like you got to walk to me like I can't like my Eve is like here
[21641.38s -> 21643.38s]  I'm way over here
[21644.38s -> 21647.02s]  Right in my eaves like yo homie
[21649.59s -> 21655.93s]  Like dude, I'm truck like we're trying to push the wave in for her and she's just not accepting to wait
[21656.71s -> 21660.75s]  And I can't w the wall
[21660.75s -> 21664.23s]  I mean, I guess I could w the wall because I was trying to walk around right?
[21664.23s -> 21668.63s]  I saw her in trouble when I was here. So I wanted her to walk towards here so I could e over the wall
[21669.47s -> 21672.33s]  That was my thought process e over the wall helped the guy
[21672.33s -> 21676.85s]  But he like didn't understand that and I just got shit on and it felt really bad
[21681.75s -> 21684.09s]  Both our solos are getting absolutely shit on
[21684.71s -> 21688.21s]  This is very bad
[21688.25s -> 21690.25s]  Because I don't know how to help our team
[21690.61s -> 21692.45s]  at this stage
[21692.45s -> 21699.24s]  Like I'm just always behind on tempo now around the map in the wrong spot at the wrong time
[21700.00s -> 21727.48s]  This is so awkward. I have old we could kill this guy
[21727.48s -> 21733.48s]  I guess not
[21735.16s -> 21756.85s]  You could maybe kill the Zen if I sneak in here push the wave push the wave hurry
[21758.33s -> 21760.17s]  He's got a crash it
[21760.17s -> 21777.44s]  I mean this guy's just dead
[21777.60s -> 21783.90s]  My 80 carry is gonna get fucked for it though. So I hope it was worth
[21784.82s -> 21786.82s]  Like my 80 carries gonna get zones
[21787.34s -> 21797.24s]  it's really hard to tell if anything like that's worth sometimes because I
[21798.72s -> 21802.72s]  Used my ult before a dragon fight. We're gonna lose bot tower. There's just so many factors, right?
[21802.76s -> 21806.36s]  It's so hard and now I don't have words. Oh, it's so rough
[21807.20s -> 21828.40s]  I got the ignite off, but dude. I can't believe that Gragas lived
[21829.08s -> 21836.68s]  No, oh, I had stopwatch. I have stopwatch. Oh my god. I'm the worst player in existence. I
[21837.48s -> 21839.84s]  Actually have the ability to still live there. Oh
[21840.84s -> 21845.07s]  No, I should sell
[21846.23s -> 21848.23s]  My magi isn't shame. I
[21849.11s -> 21851.03s]  Actually just want the item so
[21852.99s -> 21854.99s]  Dude, I'm so bad!
[21855.39s -> 21859.71s]  Dude, Gragas is low-key a good pick versus Rakan though. You can stop his engage so easily.
[21868.62s -> 21870.62s]  It's actually low-key a good pick.
[21896.43s -> 21921.81s]  Bro.
[21921.81s -> 21935.55s]  Nice. Not bad. I kind of want to back off here.
[21936.11s -> 21941.96s]  You know what it feels kind of bad? You guys noticed that I just- I got my uh-
[21943.28s -> 21945.80s]  I don't know if you guys noticed this, but I got my fucking-
[21948.85s -> 21954.17s]  I got like four assists just now, but it was after I sold my Maja's.
[21954.17s -> 21966.44s]  How fucking bad does that feel like actually oh by the way uh I wanted to ask you guys
[21968.44s -> 21970.96s]  What 80 carry do you guys think is the most
[21971.76s -> 21973.76s]  Saw out for people to learn right now
[21974.48s -> 21981.53s]  Like what would you say is like people want to learn this 80 carry over other 80 carries?
[21982.13s -> 21984.13s]  What do you guys think in?
[21984.29s -> 21986.29s]  My man says Timo, okay
[21986.53s -> 21988.37s]  Make sense
[21988.49s -> 22000.10s]  Got it depends. Yeah, I'm just trying to wonder like what
[22002.08s -> 22006.28s]  People would want to watch or what people would want to learn specifically
[22006.36s -> 22009.84s]  So I know everybody plays different shit, but I know there's also like popular shit, you know
[22015.16s -> 22017.16s]  Okay, I'm just bad
[22017.52s -> 22020.22s]  He's bad too. We listen. We're bad
[22023.48s -> 22068.97s]  We're bad guys
[22069.01s -> 22072.07s]  Not bad
[22072.07s -> 22074.07s]  Jin Lucian Zyothelios
[22074.27s -> 22077.99s]  Damn is it like just that different like a lot of people like different stuff?
[22079.86s -> 22082.78s]  Because I've always just thought like oh no I
[22090.40s -> 22093.30s]  Guess I've always just thought that people like a
[22095.79s -> 22102.23s]  Lot of people really like like meta 80 carries or like really play makey 80 carries right like jinx is probably the best 80 carry in
[22102.23s -> 22106.75s]  The meta, but I don't say a lot of people ever ask or like request to watch jinx
[22107.23s -> 22111.63s]  You know what I mean like jinx is not like she's not like a fun 80 carry that people want to learn how to play
[22111.63s -> 22115.83s]  Even though she is like the best ad there's like the people who are like, oh, yeah
[22115.83s -> 22118.15s]  No jinx is boring like I want to play gin and like shoot people
[22118.15s -> 22121.95s]  I want to play like Lucian and dash around like it's like so that's what I'm wondering is like what the number one
[22122.19s -> 22124.19s]  80 carries for like people just like enjoy watching
[22125.07s -> 22141.44s]  Not bad though
[22141.44s -> 22148.94s]  Okay, I think we could play an ad carry game. I'm down. I owe you guys an ad carry game. I
[22149.56s -> 22154.16s]  owe you that much for watching me play support for two hours. I should I think it was like two and a half hours
[22157.09s -> 22159.25s]  Yeah, we played four games of support. So it's like two hours
[22160.73s -> 22173.88s]  Yeah, I owe you guys for for that Ziya or vain Ziya is fun to watch. I do like Ziya. You love Jinx and Kate
[22173.88s -> 22175.64s]  Oh, there you go
[22175.64s -> 22184.13s]  You're playing support top so you like to watch how ad carries play it ah
[22186.33s -> 22189.39s]  So that you can like better help the homies got it got it
[22189.73s -> 22207.54s]  We need eight wins. I think from this point. We are right now. I think it's eight wins to get to grandmaster. I
[22208.48s -> 22213.24s]  think oops
[22213.24s -> 22222.42s]  Because we're what 370 something right like three set 360. No, we just won. We're not 360. We're like 370
[22223.92s -> 22228.80s]  We're 387. Okay, so it's not updated. But what is this stop?
[22229.24s -> 22236.69s]  So we need what seven wins net wins to get to GM. I
[22237.57s -> 22243.13s]  Think we can hit GM. I'm a little less confident right now about master or about challenger
[22243.33s -> 22245.33s]  But I think we can definitely hit GM
[22245.33s -> 22258.26s]  Like, I think I'll get stuck in gym for a bit, unless the games get higher quality, I'll
[22258.26s -> 22265.24s]  be stuck in gym for a little bit.
[22265.24s -> 22270.48s]  Because the thing about the games so far is like, the higher quality the games get, the
[22270.48s -> 22274.88s]  easier it actually is to carry if you're a decent player.
[22274.88s -> 22278.44s]  Because the better your teammates get, which means that like, if you're at that, like
[22278.44s -> 22281.76s]  say like a challenger player will have a better time, a challenger AD carry player
[22281.76s -> 22286.76s]  carrying in Challenger if they get a lead then in Diamond if they get a lead.
[22286.76s -> 22292.52s]  If that like, I know that sounds weird to say but it's basically just because like when
[22292.52s -> 22297.00s]  your teammates are better they enable you better and AD carry and all those other roles when
[22297.00s -> 22305.58s]  they're being enabled it's a lot easier to play the game.
[22305.58s -> 22310.74s]  Like if I were to first pick Jynx in Challenger MMR there's a good chance my teammates would
[22310.74s -> 22314.06s]  pick stuff that like lets me play Jynx right?
[22314.06s -> 22316.42s]  Not saying it would happen but there's like a chance that my teammates would pick
[22316.42s -> 22321.56s]  Something that like they would pick like tanks or frontliners or some shit right or like Lulu
[22321.82s -> 22326.60s]  Whereas like if you pick in if you're picking Jinx first picking like let's say you guys are gold average
[22326.90s -> 22331.14s]  Like your support might just literally pick like first-time Valkons or some shit, and you're like well this sucks
[22331.72s -> 22345.99s]  Dude, I swear every time I hear the end of this song
[22346.65s -> 22348.99s]  Does anybody know who forest within is I?
[22350.61s -> 22355.53s]  Swear the guy talking at the end of this song sounds exactly like forest within
[22355.53s -> 22368.73s]  no joke listen to this listen to this that guy that guy who was like saying
[22368.73s -> 22371.97s]  it was DJ what I like that guy sounded exactly like I don't know why my brain
[22371.97s -> 22376.77s]  does that homie sounded exactly like forced within I swear to God it's
[22376.77s -> 22380.79s]  actually like perfectly like if you told me that was him I would immediately
[22380.79s -> 22391.93s]  believe you this guy wants to join the discord oh I'm nervous about this
[22391.93s -> 22402.26s]  shit it is my support though so like maybe we could join the discord and like
[22402.26s -> 22412.63s]  work together a bit but I'm also nervous about joining discord calls with
[22412.63s -> 22425.18s]  people on stream oh I don't know I don't know if it's worth where would you put
[22425.18s -> 22429.86s]  Ezreal on the tier list I think Ezreal is A tier I think he could be S tier for
[22429.86s -> 22433.26s]  solo queue but he's hard he's really hard as well as one of the hardest
[22433.26s -> 22437.86s]  80s so I would say he's like A tier right now if you're really good at
[22437.86s -> 22446.62s]  is he is very very very strong but he's also incredibly hard to play but he also
[22446.62s -> 22456.82s]  is not weak in the meta so I give him like strong a like above other a's she
[22456.82s -> 22460.90s]  focused on mage supports like brand Zarath or engage a blitznautilus it
[22460.90s -> 22464.94s]  depends on your elo and it depends on what you're doing I think engage
[22464.94s -> 22478.54s]  supports in lower elo are bad. I think engage supports in lower elo are bad personally because
[22478.54s -> 22486.65s]  I think that you can be a really good engage player and it doesn't matter if your team just
[22486.65s -> 22491.29s]  gets caught over and over again or if you like make an engage and your team misplays right?
[22491.29s -> 22496.69s]  So it's like if you want to play engage supports do it because they are better than
[22496.69s -> 22502.69s]  Other like engage supports are better than mages, but I think in solo queue mages are better to solo carry
[22503.25s -> 22507.05s]  So it just depends it depends on your you know, and it depends on like what you're trying to accomplish, right?
[22507.69s -> 22511.57s]  Because a lot of the time as a support player, it's why I play Senna, right?
[22511.57s -> 22517.57s]  Like I play Senna because I like being able to carry games as support. That's why I like Senna
[22519.05s -> 22521.05s]  Whereas like if you're a
[22522.01s -> 22526.37s]  Like if I like I can play almost every support right I can play not unless I can play play
[22526.37s -> 22532.73s]  I could play these supports, but the problem is is like I feel bad if like I get like it feels really shitty to get people ahead and
[22532.73s -> 22535.93s]  Then have them completely throw their leads over and over again and then tilt and range and shit
[22535.97s -> 22537.81s]  So it feels like dog shit
[22537.81s -> 22542.23s]  So it's nicer to just like give myself the opportunity to carry rather than rely
[22542.93s -> 22548.88s]  100% on other people, you know, but I would say the number one thing is
[22550.16s -> 22552.16s]  Play what you think is fun
[22552.16s -> 22555.08s]  That's just the number one rule like playing if you want to win
[22555.08s -> 22561.22s]  You can play meta, but the problem is if like you're shoving your face and I'm trying to learn a meta champ that you just don't enjoy the
[22561.22s -> 22566.92s]  Plays that I love you're never gonna actually be good at the at the champion because you're you're like it's like you're working right?
[22567.24s -> 22571.26s]  But the best way to learn the champions and learn how to play the game is to have fun
[22571.46s -> 22573.64s]  Because you're not having fun at some point
[22573.64s -> 22578.92s]  You're not gonna be able to learn how to play because you're not gonna be able to put in the hours or put in the games and
[22578.92s -> 22582.92s]  I'd be focused during the game you're gonna be frustrated and if you're frustrated you're not gonna be learning
[22582.92s -> 22597.04s]  So I would say just play something that's fun. The fun aspect is gonna be way more important. Where'd my music go?
[22597.04s -> 22611.02s]  Fuck. I'm surprised. Can you guys even hear the music half the time?
[22611.02s -> 22614.10s]  I have it on so low that I'm not even sure you guys can hear it.
[22615.06s -> 22617.06s]  It's just like bear me background noise.
[22617.66s -> 22642.34s]  Is this guy holding swap hostage?
[22644.10s -> 22646.78s]  Join call and I'll swap.
[22653.37s -> 22655.97s]  Dude, he's holding swap hostage.
[22655.97s -> 22669.92s]  By the way, if you guys do like the stream, don't forget to follow.
[22669.92s -> 22676.06s]  You can scroll down to see all my socials too, like TikTok, Instagram, all that crap.
[22676.06s -> 22677.22s]  It's all below the stream.
[22677.22s -> 22686.96s]  There's like links and shit.
[22686.96s -> 22687.96s]  And you know.
[22687.96s -> 22689.96s]  A man's gotta eat.
[22689.96s -> 22704.64s]  You can use your Twitch Prime too if you want, you know, if you're feeling it.
[22704.64s -> 22707.98s]  I'm gonna do a Kaisa game.
[22707.98s -> 22712.78s]  He went Lux, but I kind of want to play Kaisa.
[22712.78s -> 22717.27s]  What was the voice?
[22717.27s -> 22722.43s]  This is what happens when I get close to the mic.
[22722.43s -> 22724.51s]  I should put the mic in front of my face more.
[22724.51s -> 22726.43s]  The mic's like over to the corner.
[22726.43s -> 22750.40s]  So the mic is like really badly directioned.
[22750.40s -> 22751.40s]  Uhhh...
[22751.40s -> 22757.43s]  Is this a cut down game?
[22757.43s -> 22758.43s]  Gragas always use AP.
[22758.43s -> 22760.43s]  He doesn't go tank, he goes like AP.
[22760.43s -> 22780.06s]  I kinda wanna go last stands.
[22780.06s -> 22781.06s]  That's fun.
[22781.06s -> 22782.06s]  I should have taken Ghost.
[22782.06s -> 22789.05s]  Ghost would have been so good this game.
[22789.05s -> 22790.05s]  Treadcate with Shieldbow.
[22790.05s -> 22795.56s]  It's strong. Yeah, it's fun, huh? I love Kate with shield, but it's so fun
[22796.40s -> 22798.40s]  This will have been such a good ghost game
[22799.52s -> 22801.52s]  I'm frustrated. Oh, wow. I
[22803.00s -> 22817.10s]  Like wasn't paying attention. I I always wonder if I should go
[22818.00s -> 22820.00s]  part of me always wants to go like
[22821.36s -> 22825.40s]  Long sort of three against Thresh and Ziya, but with Kaisa
[22825.40s -> 22829.92s]  I feel like you're on really specific timers with Kaisa. So you have to go like
[22829.92s -> 22836.16s]  Like it's really important to go Doran so that you can get the Q upgrade timer on the
[22836.16s -> 22839.88s]  right you know like on the right timing.
[22839.88s -> 22843.64s]  I think getting the Q upgrade timer is just so big.
[22843.64s -> 22847.68s]  Also this game I feel like I go Bork this game.
[22847.68s -> 22850.52s]  Seconds Bork or Wetsons.
[22850.52s -> 22854.44s]  If Gragas is not Ultra fed I'll probably go Bork because I don't want to get Wetson
[22854.44s -> 22855.44s]  just for Gragas.
[22855.44s -> 22875.19s]  Okay he started Q.
[22875.19s -> 22877.19s]  Diana starting on wolves
[22877.77s -> 22907.90s]  Okay, I don't think it's some coffee after this game getting drowsy. I should have done the middle minion thing. I'm so bad
[22909.42s -> 22911.72s]  Like I should have legitimately just done the thing with the minion
[22912.12s -> 22921.70s]  So when you know Thresh starts hook you can still play up, right? I can play up. I can play aggressive
[22922.06s -> 22941.69s]  I'm bad. I
[22942.05s -> 22944.05s]  Should have just killed the Thresh
[22945.05s -> 22947.63s]  This is really bad man. We can't help we can't help
[22947.63s -> 22956.57s]  because the wave the way the waves going I'm so bad I fucked up it should be fine
[22956.57s -> 22963.60s]  but I still like it were it it fucks us over early game because they fucked up
[22963.60s -> 22969.20s]  very badly like I can't stress enough how badly they just fucked up but it
[22969.20s -> 22976.24s]  didn't matter okay that's that's happening apparently don't worry guys
[22976.24s -> 22989.60s]  I'm the best Ziya player or Kaisa player on the server it's me a caught I am
[22989.60s -> 23006.72s]  I'm just literally playing like dog shits.
[23006.72s -> 23008.02s]  I picked Kaisa.
[23008.02s -> 23014.65s]  I just felt like playing her.
[23014.65s -> 23015.65s]  We got her back.
[23015.65s -> 23018.09s]  We have to leave the wave in a bad spot.
[23018.09s -> 23031.08s]  Maybe she can push it, but like Wukong's here, so yeah, we just, okay, we got it, nice.
[23031.08s -> 23032.72s]  Not bad.
[23032.72s -> 23036.56s]  So we had to push the wave in there so that the wave will bounce back, but we had to
[23036.56s -> 23038.28s]  do it on a, it was a really bad timer.
[23038.28s -> 23041.32s]  Let me just say, I fucked up the entire early game of this game.
[23041.32s -> 23043.72s]  Like this game is, I'm so bad.
[23043.72s -> 23047.20s]  Essentially what should have happened was level one, when they walked up, when
[23047.20s -> 23050.24s]  When Kaisen Thresh walked up level 1, we should have killed them.
[23050.24s -> 23054.62s]  Like I should have just straight up hit the Thresh with the Lux because Thresh walked into
[23054.62s -> 23057.42s]  our wave because Wukong was level 2 ganking.
[23057.42s -> 23058.42s]  Should have just killed him.
[23058.42s -> 23059.54s]  I grieved that.
[23059.54s -> 23062.66s]  And because I went for the Zyah instead, I put myself in a spot where I took like
[23062.66s -> 23068.02s]  80% of my HP for free, right, which put me behind and now the entire fight was like
[23068.02s -> 23071.10s]  harder because I was low and then we had to wait for the wait.
[23071.10s -> 23074.74s]  It was just, it was really bad.
[23074.74s -> 23076.06s]  Really.
[23076.06s -> 23085.99s]  Minion actually just did that. I don't think we can kill this guy unless she can max range land a queue or something
[23085.99s -> 23097.50s]  But yeah, is there the best lady right now? No, I think Jinx is better. I think there is good
[23098.08s -> 23101.40s]  Her way came especially with like paired with an agenda. It's areas insane
[23102.12s -> 23104.78s]  But I think Jinx is better for solo queue
[23106.88s -> 23116.30s]  I should have to flash that was a good play hook by that guy I disrespected him
[23116.30s -> 23127.58s]  Hmm. I might have to leave because Wukong can just go here and dive me. I actually just have to leave. This feels so bad
[23128.28s -> 23130.28s]  You see how Wukong just use the plants?
[23131.84s -> 23137.60s]  If I stay I can just die right so I'm just misplaying all over the place. I'm taking too much damage
[23137.60s -> 23139.60s]  We're playing weak side right now, right?
[23139.68s -> 23143.66s]  What I mean by that is like we know our Diana's top and we know their Wukong's bot
[23143.92s -> 23146.68s]  So because of that I need to play a lot less
[23146.68s -> 23150.92s]  Trady like I walked up and just let the Thresh flame me for free and I missed two waves now
[23150.92s -> 23153.74s]  I need to not do that because if I don't miss these waves
[23153.74s -> 23158.24s]  It doesn't matter for week siding because I'm not behind so it's it's just really stupid
[23158.68s -> 23166.84s]  Now what I do want to do is I want to go check and see if the wukong is like on our camps or something
[23166.94s -> 23177.36s]  Or if he's doing dragon or some shits. I should not have used the blast cone. Dude. I am so bad. I
[23178.36s -> 23180.36s]  Used the blast cone to just hit it
[23180.56s -> 23184.00s]  It's playing support man. It makes your it makes your brain smaller
[23184.00s -> 23211.54s]  actually like I swear playing support makes my brain smaller oh they're in
[23211.54s -> 23239.97s]  dragon the Ziya is trolling I think pretty sure I just freeze this no with
[23239.97s -> 23250.72s]  the Lux yeah she's just trolling I don't know what the fuck that was I took a
[23250.72s -> 23278.37s]  little bit of damage but she has to overextend now not bad okay so the Ziya
[23278.37s -> 23281.65s]  wanted to back the reason that I froze that was because I once the back but
[23281.65s -> 23284.41s]  but she can't back until we push the wave in,
[23284.41s -> 23285.81s]  or until they push the wave in, right?
[23285.81s -> 23288.41s]  So it gives me time to kind of catch up
[23288.41s -> 23290.65s]  on my back timer with Ziya,
[23290.65s -> 23292.73s]  because I'm a little bit behind in farm.
[23301.77s -> 23303.69s]  Thresh is definitely gonna go mid here.
[23304.57s -> 23305.85s]  He's either gonna go mid or he's gonna try
[23305.85s -> 23307.33s]  and hook us from the bush.
[23308.89s -> 23311.77s]  I think I'm gonna shoot my W through all the bushes here.
[23311.77s -> 23313.67s]  Okay, Thresh isn't in the bushes.
[23315.13s -> 23317.81s]  He's just mea, yeah, we don't know where he is.
[23317.81s -> 23323.75s]  is awkward because I can't really walk up. I mean I guess I'm almost 6 so I guess I could walk up.
[23325.59s -> 23336.48s]  Yeah there he is okay we see him. He is level 5 so it's we could probably actually fight like if
[23336.48s -> 23352.93s]  this guy lands a binding I might be able to just trade. I'm dead. I suck. Honestly I needed my bad.
[23355.97s -> 23361.57s]  I'm playing bad. That's on me. Bilox is playing so good. I needed a
[23361.57s -> 23366.25s]  W but then back up after the bind I've just I'm mechanically
[23366.89s -> 23369.45s]  Shitting on myself right now like out of my mouth. Just shit
[23370.05s -> 23376.81s]  Because I knew exactly what was gonna happen when I used W in front of the fucking thrashes face. I was like
[23377.37s -> 23379.37s]  Here we go. You know what I mean?
[23379.89s -> 23385.13s]  Technically we're both six and he's five, but it doesn't matter because if I get hooked. I don't have enough damage
[23385.13s -> 23388.51s]  So now here
[23388.87s -> 23399.15s]  I'm gonna walk up and see if I can stop this I as back maybe maybe she's backing in a weird spot
[23401.49s -> 23404.53s]  Yeah, we stopped their backs. Huge. Okay, now they're in trouble.
[23406.37s -> 23409.81s]  So, they really needed the back on that timer?
[23411.17s -> 23412.85s]  Because they just want to fight, right?
[23413.57s -> 23415.97s]  And because they just want to fight, they want to go back, right?
[23417.81s -> 23426.02s]  No way! Dude, fuck off! I cannot dodge a hook right now to save my fucking life.
[23427.30s -> 23430.34s]  Jesus Christ. What is my movement, man?
[23430.34s -> 23445.13s]  Like tilting myself right now. I want to stay for this wave, but mid is Mia
[23447.61s -> 23449.61s]  Yeah, I can't
[23450.33s -> 23454.73s]  It feels so bad because I needed one more wave to get double pickaxe
[23455.49s -> 23457.25s]  So I can get my upgrade
[23457.25s -> 23461.29s]  Because like normally you go noon quiver pickaxe pickaxe if you go noon pick pick
[23461.69s -> 23464.37s]  It gives you enough ad to get your Q upgrade, right?
[23464.37s -> 23468.43s]  And that's like the whole point you don't need Kraken you see your Q upgrade because your Q upgrades when you start bursting
[23468.43s -> 23474.09s]  But because I got hooked under the turrets even though we got a kill I had to back and I couldn't get my timer
[23474.59s -> 23488.54s]  I'm so trash. I need some coffee. That's what it is man. I swear to God
[23489.46s -> 23491.46s]  Coffee is my savior. It'll save me
[23520.46s -> 23523.10s]  That wave actually just did that to me holy shit
[23524.38s -> 23526.64s]  We don't actually have to do anything here crazy
[23538.82s -> 23547.63s]  Nice well played
[23558.31s -> 23560.31s]  Nice nice nice
[23560.31s -> 23562.31s]  That was a good 2v2.
[23562.31s -> 23572.46s]  Alright I got my Q upgrade, now we're chillin'.
[23572.46s -> 23574.46s]  Oh now we're hella chillin'.
[23574.46s -> 23576.96s]  Oh yeah baby.
[23576.96s -> 23583.59s]  You know what it is, it's like uh...
[23583.59s -> 23586.09s]  I'm playing the fights too quick.
[23586.09s -> 23594.48s]  I just gotta slow down and like think I'm like too hyped up.
[23594.48s -> 23607.59s]  I really don't want to miss this wave.
[23607.59s -> 23609.59s]  There's a person right there.
[23609.59s -> 23611.59s]  Oh shit, let's go.
[23611.59s -> 23613.59s]  Yeah he's dead.
[23613.59s -> 23616.59s]  I'm gonna go farm bot while that guy gets that.
[23616.59s -> 23634.12s]  This locks is really good. I kind of want to oh, I can't get this plate fuck
[23636.34s -> 23637.68s]  What?
[23637.68s -> 23639.16s]  What?
[23639.16s -> 23641.16s]  That was BS
[23645.18s -> 23649.62s]  Okay, you know what? I'll just take my entire HP bar really quick on the turret. It's not a big deal guys
[23650.90s -> 23654.26s]  I'm just I'm that good at the game like I don't mean to brag but like you know
[23654.98s -> 23656.98s]  professional gamer over here like you know
[23657.66s -> 23661.16s]  Gonna be the one some lessons like I got you
[23670.68s -> 23672.68s]  Dude look how big my shield is
[23672.68s -> 23713.95s]  wait you son of a bitch I mean she's dead but okay I'll play it man mother fucker
[23713.95s -> 23734.67s]  all right they fought for them nice well I need to make some coffee I'm
[23734.67s -> 23754.17s]  playing give me a sec we're playing real bad I need some coffee nice though we
[23754.17s -> 23759.13s]  hit 400 LP let's go so now we just need 150 more we need 550 I think 550
[23759.13s -> 23777.33s]  is gym I didn't do anything that game by the way I did nothing I could play another
[23777.33s -> 23783.33s]  ad carry game that was fun I'm gonna grab some coffee I'll be right back talks
[23783.33s -> 23788.77s]  amongst yourselves boys I believe in you you can look at my ad carry tier list
[23788.77s -> 23793.53s]  that we've been trying to figure out how to do enjoy I'll be ready grab some
[23793.53s -> 23911.66s]  coffee oh fucking a all right I'm back let's go the book sweet we back boys we
[23911.66s -> 23924.43s]  back time is at five oh I probably play for like another hour and then I gotta
[23924.43s -> 23940.06s]  get off and make some dinner do some other shit you know I'm saying where
[23940.06s -> 23943.50s]  Oh, yeah, we're making the tierless. Yeah, I think Varus is really good a I
[23944.74s -> 23946.74s]  Think versus good a tier cuz um
[23947.90s -> 23949.30s]  In my opinion
[23949.30s -> 23953.04s]  Varus is never really like a bad pick almost like sometimes he's bad
[23953.04s -> 23957.84s]  But I think he's just you can play him on hit or you can play him without he right
[23957.84s -> 23960.30s]  So he's got two builds that you can do based on the game in the team comp
[23960.58s -> 23962.58s]  His ulti is pretty much always useful
[23963.50s -> 23967.50s]  Like just having a stun like a root on a champion is always gonna be useful
[23967.50s -> 23973.00s]  Then you have he's got a very long range like engage you can safely kill people with his ult and his Q
[23973.56s -> 23979.32s]  You can build him poke where like before objectives you can make picks really easily you can poke people out before the objective get him low
[23979.88s -> 23985.76s]  His lane phase is really good. If you're if you understand like how to play Varus his lane phase is exceptional. He also has
[23987.76s -> 23990.84s]  In the meta currently I feel like he's just like a good pick
[23990.84s -> 23995.36s]  I don't think he's as good as Draven and Jinx for solo queue, but I do think he's really good
[23995.36s -> 24002.12s]  In general, you can you can climb with them really easily and then I put ash here, too
[24002.92s -> 24005.36s]  Maybe ash. I don't know who I'd put in front
[24006.44s -> 24011.92s]  Ash or Varys. I think maybe ash or maybe Varys. I think ash is really underrated though
[24011.92s -> 24027.08s]  I think ash is super super good right now. I think ash is super good
[24027.96s -> 24029.44s]  because
[24029.44s -> 24031.44s]  Sorry, I'm trying to think
[24032.36s -> 24036.06s]  She's basically the same idea as Varys. She's a little different, but she's the same idea
[24037.36s -> 24042.16s]  She controls lane phase pretty well, rarely her lane isn't too bad.
[24042.16s -> 24047.24s]  She also has, like her R, always useful no matter what.
[24047.24s -> 24051.20s]  So like you always have use with Ashe, you always have use with Varus R, like they just
[24051.20s -> 24052.76s]  stuns, snares, etc.
[24052.76s -> 24054.26s]  And so I'll look here.
[24054.26s -> 24057.04s]  She's also really good at being annoying in teamfights, like you can take Ghost on
[24057.04s -> 24061.40s]  Ashe and you can just Voli, sit outside their range and if you just basically solo
[24061.40s -> 24062.68s]  people.
[24062.68s -> 24066.52s]  And she actually has decent scaling on her crit now, so you can go a bunch of
[24066.52s -> 24070.96s]  builds too like I think you can go Bork Ash you can go Kraken Slayer Ash into Bork or
[24070.96s -> 24076.28s]  you can go Kraken Slayer into IE or you can go Kraken Slayer into like whatever you can
[24076.28s -> 24079.56s]  go Shieldbow Ash if they have tanks you can go Galeforce that oh you can just do a lot
[24079.56s -> 24082.64s]  of different builds on Ash and I think she's really versatile you can also just go the
[24082.64s -> 24087.04s]  on head build if you really want I I think the rageblade build sucks personally I think
[24087.04s -> 24091.24s]  that if I was going to go on hit I would just be like Shieldbow Whits and into like
[24091.24s -> 24095.32s]  Bork or some shit if I was actually going to do that or Shieldbow Bork or Bork Whits
[24095.32s -> 24105.97s]  or whatever but yeah I don't know Ezreal is probably A tier 2 I said Ezreal is
[24105.97s -> 24111.17s]  really gated by like skill so I don't want to put him in I think if you could
[24111.17s -> 24114.61s]  play Ezreal perfectly he'd be at the top of S like he would just be above
[24114.61s -> 24118.85s]  Jinx just best champion in the game if you could if you could never miss a
[24118.85s -> 24121.37s]  skill shot like a hundred percent accuracy playing perfect like the
[24121.37s -> 24124.81s]  champs insane right it's absolutely crazy how good that champ is if you
[24124.81s -> 24128.53s]  You can play him perfect, but you're like people are humans, etc.
[24128.53s -> 24132.09s]  So I think he's like an A tier pick in solo queue because you can get countered, like
[24132.09s -> 24133.09s]  he's not blindable.
[24133.09s -> 24135.65s]  You can get countered pretty easily by good players.
[24135.65s -> 24140.29s]  People play like push comps, people play dive comps, like early game, I mean in lane
[24140.29s -> 24141.29s]  and shits.
[24141.29s -> 24144.93s]  Like, because Ezreal's lane is like not, it's not bad, but it's very difficult to
[24144.93s -> 24146.53s]  play Ezreal well in lane phase.
[24146.53s -> 24148.29s]  You gotta be good mechanically.
[24148.29s -> 24151.61s]  And I don't think, even like, I've seen like challenger players who can't play
[24151.61s -> 24152.61s]  Ezreal.
[24152.61s -> 24196.00s]  he's not easy you know what I'm saying what's up boys so I was gonna be in
[24196.00s -> 24206.08s]  kindred but I couldn't find her I hate kindred you know how we do it at night
[24206.08s -> 24247.70s]  how's everybody's day okay so this guy is picking Thresh again Thresh into
[24247.70s -> 24261.96s]  Rickon Thresh is actually pretty good in the Rickon they have Zaya Thresh again
[24261.96s -> 24289.38s]  let's play Jinx I like Jinx here even though it is against Thresh Jinx is a
[24289.38s -> 24300.68s]  little scary right but I kind of like her in this situation. Do I want free
[24300.68s -> 24307.69s]  boots? Nah I think I want to be able to get early boots this game because
[24307.69s -> 24312.65s]  their team comp is like oh yeah their team comp is really really annoying so
[24312.65s -> 24320.89s]  I kind of want to get early boots. I'll probably go present some mines
[24320.89s -> 24330.86s]  although I think over hill isn't bad. Actually I'll go over hill. So yeah
[24330.86s -> 24333.74s]  These runes look good. Actually, let's do this.
[24335.50s -> 24336.00s]  Right there.
[24337.24s -> 24337.74s]  This.
[24343.11s -> 24344.23s]  Yeah, this is good. Okay.
[24344.95s -> 24347.55s]  I kind of like these. This is good. I'm gonna use these. Okay.
[24348.35s -> 24352.83s]  I'm taking clients this game because they have Lissandra and Pantheon and Thresh, right?
[24352.83s -> 24354.99s]  So with Lissandra, Pantheon and Thresh,
[24356.75s -> 24360.79s]  the game's gonna be like really fast of like, okay, if they stun me,
[24360.79s -> 24364.51s]  I'm just gonna get CC chained and I'm just gonna die like after a bit, right?
[24364.51s -> 24367.79s]  It's gonna be like a stun, and there's a stun, and there's a stun, and there's a stun, and I'm just gonna die.
[24367.79s -> 24373.04s]  So I'm like nah, fuck that shit.
[24373.04s -> 24402.10s]  Let's see if we can get this W, boys.
[24402.10s -> 24412.31s]  Let's see if I can not fuck up the first three levels of the lane.
[24412.31s -> 24417.75s]  Got chat restricted? Oh yeah.
[24417.75s -> 24419.67s]  It's for a while.
[24419.67s -> 24427.08s]  It's Riot's secret code to make it so I can actually play the game
[24427.08s -> 24448.71s]  and climb without chatting. Okay.
[24448.71s -> 24451.07s]  I should have warded this bush.
[24451.07s -> 24455.51s]  I was drinking my coffee and I didn't think about it.
[24455.71s -> 24457.71s]  But yeah, if you guys are against the hook champ
[24458.21s -> 24462.97s]  Always ward this bush
[24462.97s -> 24464.97s]  Right like right here. You're gonna want to
[24465.85s -> 24468.05s]  Ward here early against the most hook champions
[24469.17s -> 24471.41s]  Because it gives you a very nice
[24472.01s -> 24475.47s]  Like they can't walk in here in cheese you they can't walk in here in cheese you
[24475.93s -> 24511.38s]  So you just don't get cheesed by anything. I mean, that's just I don't even know what I just saw
[24512.70s -> 24515.30s]  I'll be real. I don't know what the fuck just happened, but okay
[24515.30s -> 24520.94s]  I'm trying to push this wave as fast as I can, I'm not sure I can actually get it pushed
[24520.94s -> 24533.82s]  fast enough but we're going to try.
[24533.82s -> 24539.46s]  It was close.
[24539.46s -> 24544.18s]  No I'm going to let it just push, it's not a huge deal.
[24544.18s -> 24546.34s]  It was very close though.
[24546.34s -> 24547.70s]  We can just break the freeze right?
[24547.70s -> 24548.70s]  It's not a huge deal.
[24548.70s -> 24554.48s]  Are they supposed to win level 1?
[24554.48s -> 24558.76s]  It depends, I mean Ziya's not that good level 1.
[24558.76s -> 24561.40s]  She's good because she has her feathers right?
[24561.40s -> 24565.24s]  But if you can't stack your feathers level 1, Jinx has more damage.
[24565.24s -> 24567.42s]  And they stacked up for my rocket.
[24567.42s -> 24572.72s]  So I got like, I full stacked my lethal tempo and I just double AoE rocketed them over and
[24572.72s -> 24576.82s]  over and over and over again, right?
[24576.82s -> 24582.42s]  And so when they finally all end, they were just behind an HP.
[24582.42s -> 24610.95s]  Also Thresh missed Pyongyang Flay.
[24610.95s -> 24611.95s]  Damn.
[24611.95s -> 24614.31s]  That was so close, man.
[24614.31s -> 24630.06s]  Like actually.
[24630.06s -> 24632.86s]  If Thresh had died there, or not Thresh, if Graves had died there, Graves would
[24632.86s -> 24650.65s]  to die there we just win the game yeah this isn't good oh I'm gonna get played
[24650.65s -> 24657.57s]  I'm dead maybe oh maybe I'm not dead I have to walk up like this it was a
[24657.57s -> 24662.93s]  really bad fight by the what what am I watching what the fuck that was a bad
[24662.93s -> 24668.69s]  fight because we knew Graves was bot and we knew that he was gonna kill in
[24668.69s -> 24673.33s]  the jungle right so like my jungler already got outplayed by Graves
[24673.33s -> 24679.99s]  Once topside you shouldn't ever take another fight like that botside you should just take the win right like I rotated
[24680.73s -> 24684.19s]  Now granted the Rickon should have been there to help kill the graves
[24684.69s -> 24687.75s]  Like when I rotated Rickon was still jacking off in lane
[24688.25s -> 24693.27s]  Right like when I was here Rickon was like way down here. So the support should have rotated first
[24694.41s -> 24697.31s]  Right like I rotated but the support should have been the one rotating
[24697.31s -> 24701.67s]  But again, he's just a lot of the time you have support players who don't understand timers
[24701.67s -> 24706.15s]  And I had to help junk nobody plays for jungle support players hate playing for jungle in low era
[24706.79s -> 24709.19s]  So it's just not a thing
[24710.11s -> 24714.91s]  So I tried to go over and help him, but I misplaced my traps a little bit and
[24716.27s -> 24717.63s]  then
[24717.63s -> 24719.63s]  the graves had a flash but he got away and
[24721.35s -> 24724.59s]  They tried to go in again when I was too low to actually help
[24725.27s -> 24734.17s]  We just got lucky. We didn't lose the game off that shit kind of does suck those. I was really strong now
[24749.65s -> 24753.01s]  Not bad. I should have. Oh, I should have I could have killed her I
[24754.37s -> 24759.44s]  Supposedly I could have killed the guy no joke. I totally could have killed him
[24760.64s -> 24764.52s]  If I had warded the lantern as he tried to take it I would have killed the Zaya
[24766.68s -> 24768.68s]  Because she ego'd the lantern there
[24778.32s -> 24782.30s]  She ego'd the lantern so hard if I had if I had warded it she dies there
[24783.56s -> 24797.04s]  It's my bad this game is really interesting because
[24798.60s -> 24800.76s]  The enemy ball lanes actually misplaying a lot
[24800.76s -> 24806.20s]  Like they're they're really really really misplaying these fights and trades and shit, but uh
[24807.12s -> 24809.12s]  We can't abuse it
[24810.36s -> 24812.80s]  Because the graves has so much control of the game right now
[24813.24s -> 24818.44s]  That we have to basically play safe permanently at the moments and I can't do anything to help my team
[24818.68s -> 24838.36s]  It feels really bad. Oh my guys again. Yeah, there we go. See you look graves bought again, man
[24838.36s -> 24848.51s]  This is so rough
[24848.51s -> 24855.22s]  Graves is man. I want to kill this as fast as I can
[24855.22s -> 24872.60s]  We can fight these guys to be to actually wait. Why didn't he just go in?
[24872.60s -> 24886.86s]  I don't know why he didn't just double you immediately like they were con weighted. Oh that tilts me
[24887.50s -> 24891.88s]  Like when she was against the wall here, he should have immediately w'd her
[24894.22s -> 24895.52s]  because
[24895.52s -> 24898.90s]  If he W's from vision there, right and and she's against the wall
[24899.20s -> 24905.28s]  It helps us so much because then I can I can overlay my flame chomps on top of the I
[24905.28s -> 24912.52s]  I can overlay my flame chomps directly on top of the Zaya right as the fight's happening rather than like having to
[24913.04s -> 24916.04s]  Work around the fight because thresh is in my face type shit, you know
[24916.54s -> 24923.74s]  So we're just we're honestly just losing because we're not pulling the trigger fast enough and
[24925.90s -> 24928.42s]  We can't play aggressive when we can pull the trigger
[24930.48s -> 24933.58s]  Right like we're losing because we can't pull the trigger fast enough and when we can pull the trigger
[24933.58s -> 24935.58s]  It's the wrong time
[24938.10s -> 24940.10s]  We do this right now. We get dragon
[24940.10s -> 24956.44s]  the bot lane back do we get dragon here I want to go I actually want to go with
[24956.44s -> 24963.98s]  the enemy bot lane didn't back okay they're trolling they lost an objective
[24963.98s -> 24967.50s]  for free here this is really good so the enemy bot lane we fight this by the way
[24967.50s -> 24981.32s]  we just we can just start a fight that right there is how you lantern are you
[24981.32s -> 24983.00s]  We've worn a Lantern by the way.
[24985.52s -> 24992.52s]  Oh, I did that guy so dirty.
[24992.52s -> 24993.82s]  Oh, I'm dead. Bye guys.
[25001.17s -> 25002.49s]  I didn't know Pantheon was Mia.
[25002.49s -> 25003.49s]  That was my bad.
[25004.73s -> 25009.88s]  I was like, I was too happy with warding the Lantern.
[25009.88s -> 25015.48s]  My bad.
[25015.48s -> 25016.84s]  I can't believe the enemy team
[25016.84s -> 25023.13s]  greeted that hard though for gold.
[25023.13s -> 25031.98s]  Oh yeah, that's actually nuts to me.
[25031.98s -> 25035.00s]  No, yeah, the Ziyas egoing like crazy.
[25035.00s -> 25041.52s]  The problem is I can't abuse it constantly because like obviously like I need teammates, right?
[25042.44s -> 25044.44s]  But I can kind of abuse it like
[25045.16s -> 25047.72s]  But it's much harder by yourself
[25048.44s -> 25055.11s]  Because as you can see like I'm not playing poorly, but we're getting like
[25056.03s -> 25057.87s]  We're getting shit on
[25057.87s -> 25059.87s]  Shit on's a bad word. We're getting like oh
[25076.07s -> 25078.07s]  Come on man
[25078.39s -> 25082.53s]  They misplayed that so badly
[25082.53s -> 25091.71s]  but Rakan just ate the fucking whatever I'm not gonna blame Rakan it's fun I'm
[25091.71s -> 25097.05s]  still sad about that though they misplayed that so incredibly badly like so
[25097.05s -> 25102.83s]  badly it was just that like Rakan all in the thresh with his ultimate but all he
[25102.83s -> 25107.35s]  had to do there was use his E to come back to me and then play front to back
[25107.35s -> 25112.39s]  afterward but he's he's not there auto-wing the thresh but you don't need
[25112.39s -> 25120.05s]  to auto him, you just need to engage and then I can maybe play after it.
[25120.05s -> 25126.02s]  I probably could have double killed them there too, I kind of messed up.
[25126.02s -> 25128.46s]  My team wants out.
[25128.46s -> 25135.33s]  It's not, it's silly because the game's not even over.
[25135.33s -> 25138.83s]  We actually can win this game so incredibly easily.
[25138.83s -> 25142.97s]  So easily, if we just play it correctly, because their bot lane is really fucking
[25142.97s -> 25143.97s]  bad.
[25143.97s -> 25147.75s]  I didn't want to be mean, but I'll just be mean, their bot lane is really fucking
[25147.75s -> 25155.50s]  bad.
[25155.50s -> 25157.66s]  Well, I'm dead.
[25157.66s -> 25166.50s]  still bad. I'm just ego-ing. That was my ego. I still stand by it. I still think
[25166.50s -> 25171.10s]  they're bad. This guy's just playing 1v3 mid. The Thresh has not been mid one time,
[25171.10s -> 25181.45s]  so it must be the top laner. I'm so frustrated right now with this game
[25181.45s -> 25189.00s]  because I feel like we should have won so many all-ins that we didn't win
[25189.00s -> 25193.00s]  barely like one like barely right like barely didn't win small wins. I
[25193.00s -> 25195.00s]  I thought we should have won all of them
[25196.62s -> 25200.64s]  Like they they didn't land like a good all-in once Thresh didn't land a single hook once
[25201.64s -> 25202.64s]  and
[25202.64s -> 25215.46s]  This is my Recon like he just tried to he just used his R to try and engage. I think Nocturne is done mentally
[25219.19s -> 25221.19s]  Okay, so in games like this
[25223.09s -> 25225.09s]  Like this Thresh is so bad. Oh
[25248.19s -> 25250.19s]  Let's go, baby
[25250.67s -> 25257.40s]  Huge that was so huge. Let's fucking go
[25257.40s -> 25280.10s]  like I'm gonna hit no at 15 because dude I really don't want to lose to this
[25280.10s -> 25285.86s]  Thresh and Asaya like this Thresh is doing the most the most ego shit I've
[25285.86s -> 25291.10s]  ever seen and he's just getting away with shit like right there Thresh walks up
[25291.10s -> 25297.34s]  whiffs every spell and expects to get away with that shit no no no we win
[25297.34s -> 25302.70s]  these we win these trust give me let me cook let me cook I see my team to let
[25302.70s -> 25308.48s]  me cook a bit you know like we had a bad early game had to play weak side let me
[25308.48s -> 25345.28s]  cook let me cook we are chilling if I landed that that would have been sick
[25345.28s -> 25386.00s]  the rest is top two we can kill this guy come on guys don't forfeit guys the
[25386.00s -> 25392.32s]  game is winnable oh my god dude the game is how is the Rakan gonna forfeit
[25392.32s -> 25409.16s]  dude that game is so winnable it hurts like dude really that actually is so
[25409.16s -> 25417.74s]  infuriating that's so infuriating man that game was so incredibly winnable
[25417.74s -> 25425.65s]  like look at this I did more damage than every single player on the enemy team if
[25425.65s -> 25433.45s]  my team just relaxed we win the game a thousand times over that game like the
[25433.45s -> 25436.17s]  The game is over.
[25436.17s -> 25440.81s]  We have a Recon, a Rumble, and a Wukong for me to sit behind.
[25440.81s -> 25443.33s]  And we saw how bad their bot lane was, right?
[25443.33s -> 25447.23s]  I have Quendans for the only way they can kill me.
[25447.23s -> 25448.23s]  Whatever, man.
[25448.23s -> 25451.87s]  Dude, I wish to god, I'm gonna report them all, like these fuckers, I guarantee I get
[25451.87s -> 25453.47s]  a notification.
[25453.47s -> 25457.68s]  There's no way these people are not toxic.
[25457.68s -> 25462.16s]  There's no way you int this, like you just want out of the game after a fucking,
[25462.16s -> 25464.48s]  your team is just doing well.
[25464.48s -> 25482.60s]  Nah man, the score is 10 to 14. 10 to 14. You have a Fed 80 carry. Look at this. Dude,
[25482.60s -> 25492.60s]  we forfeited, we were down 2.5k. We had a better scaling comp than them. Like, we out-scaled
[25492.60s -> 25504.38s]  them, we have two dragons, we outscale them, and we're down 2.5k, and my team rage hits
[25504.38s -> 25505.38s]  forfeit.
[25505.38s -> 25510.28s]  Oh my god, that's so gross.
[25510.28s -> 25518.24s]  That is so disgusting.
[25518.24s -> 25524.56s]  So disgusting.
[25524.56s -> 25528.88s]  Why am I in a game with this player?
[25528.88s -> 25533.44s]  I'm 412 LP Masters.
[25533.44s -> 25540.36s]  I was in a game just now with a 7 LP Masters jungler.
[25540.36s -> 25541.78s]  And he's not on a smurf.
[25541.78s -> 25545.68s]  This is not a smurf account.
[25545.68s -> 25549.57s]  Because last season this guy was d4.
[25549.57s -> 25551.51s]  So he's not on a smurf.
[25551.51s -> 25556.50s]  Why is this player in my game?
[25556.50s -> 25561.02s]  Why is this player in a 400 LP Master game?
[25561.02s -> 25562.14s]  Why?
[25562.14s -> 25569.83s]  Or rather why am I in a Diamond 1 game?
[25569.83s -> 25573.03s]  You can go to his previous games, he doesn't even have good MMR.
[25573.03s -> 25578.39s]  Like if you look at these games, they're all like 100-200LP, right?
[25578.39s -> 25579.67s]  Why am I in this game?
[25579.67s -> 25583.35s]  Why did you put me in a game with this player?
[25583.35s -> 25585.55s]  Like this guy, I don't even care if he sucks.
[25585.55s -> 25590.27s]  I'm more frustrated at the fact that these players mental boom at the first sign of
[25590.27s -> 25591.27s]  any negativity.
[25591.27s -> 25593.07s]  Look at this.
[25593.07s -> 25594.19s]  They just give up.
[25594.19s -> 25598.03s]  First sign of anything negative, they go next.
[25598.03s -> 25601.61s]  Like I actually could have 1v9ed this game too, like actually.
[25601.61s -> 25606.27s]  But I'm not allowed to try and 1v9 because my team once out of the game had fucking 4 minutes,
[25606.27s -> 25607.95s]  or 15 minutes.
[25607.95s -> 25610.71s]  That sucks man.
[25610.71s -> 25612.51s]  The new system is trash.
[25612.51s -> 25618.51s]  Like I'm sorry, but the 4-15 system is good sometimes.
[25618.51s -> 25622.13s]  They should have a requirement that you have to be losing by X amount of gold for
[25622.13s -> 25624.15s]  it to kick in.
[25624.15s -> 25626.07s]  That should be it.
[25626.07s -> 25627.83s]  They should have a requirement.
[25627.83s -> 25634.64s]  You have to be losing by 5k plus for it to work at 15k.
[25634.64s -> 25642.08s]  There needs to be something where there's a requirement because people are so stupid.
[25642.08s -> 25643.96s]  That game was 100% ours.
[25643.96s -> 25650.48s]  We had two dragons, we're down 2000 gold at 16 minutes, and Wukong's 3-1.
[25650.48s -> 25651.48s]  We were down 4 kills.
[25651.48s -> 25657.48s]  Wukong's 3-1.
[25657.48s -> 25663.58s]  I'm literally insanely strong even though we got weak-sided, I'm still winning.
[25663.58s -> 25665.58s]  We just 2v2'd them bot side of the map, right?
[25665.58s -> 25668.86s]  We just want a 2v2.
[25668.86s -> 25674.06s]  Rumble's just like, like, ah, sorry, I'm just mad, I'm mad.
[25674.06s -> 25678.26s]  Like they need to require, they need to require something other than four people, like require
[25678.26s -> 25680.90s]  four people and a gold lead or something.
[25680.90s -> 25685.18s]  Like that's so cancer.
[25685.18s -> 25687.14s]  That's so fucking frustrating, man.
[25687.14s -> 25693.32s]  Like, I can't believe how bad people's mentals are.
[25693.32s -> 25695.52s]  Like the, okay, I get it.
[25695.52s -> 25699.76s]  The rumble and the nocturne I understand wanting to forfeit, okay?
[25699.76s -> 25702.96s]  Okay, they're having a bad game, they want out, they're raging, they need to get their
[25702.96s -> 25703.96s]  frustration.
[25703.96s -> 25704.96s]  I get it.
[25704.96s -> 25713.02s]  But why are we forfeiting when Wukong is three and one?
[25713.02s -> 25717.82s]  I have seven of our KP, I'm the 80 carry, I'm very strong, I just got my mythic.
[25717.82s -> 25720.12s]  We have two dragons.
[25720.12s -> 25721.12s]  And Rakan's forfeiting two.
[25721.12s -> 25726.90s]  Ah, I don't know man.
[25726.90s -> 25765.81s]  That's just frustrating, so I'll be real, I carry this game every day of the week.
[25765.81s -> 25770.45s]  So apparently Riot is doing something about smurfing though, and I can't wait until they
[25770.45s -> 25772.61s]  do.
[25772.61s -> 25776.49s]  This is actually a really good thing that I wanted to talk about earlier in the stream,
[25776.49s -> 25778.09s]  but I forgot.
[25778.09s -> 25782.09s]  Apparently Riot is doing something to make smurfing harder, because apparently smurfing
[25782.09s -> 25784.09s]  is outrageous right now.
[25784.09s -> 25788.73s]  And I kind of think that they need to stop this too.
[25788.73s -> 25796.11s]  So there's a thing you can do in solo queue right now where you can make a new account
[25796.11s -> 25803.49s]  and you can duo with somebody on different accounts on a new account and your MMR doesn't
[25803.49s -> 25809.23s]  actually get lowered.
[25809.23s -> 25824.36s]  So if you win a game, let's say you win a game and in that game you duo with somebody
[25824.36s -> 25826.48s]  in a lower MMR, right?
[25826.48s -> 25830.08s]  Now when you duo in a lower MMR, I don't know if this guy did this or not, but when
[25830.08s -> 25835.40s]  you duo with somebody in a lower MMR, your MMR is based on now the game thinks that
[25835.40s -> 25839.28s]  you're in that MMR and you can do it in placements.
[25839.28s -> 25843.92s]  So in your very first games, for some reason, there's no MMR lock on placements.
[25843.92s -> 25850.68s]  So you can in your placements duo with somebody who's like bronze, right?
[25850.68s -> 25852.40s]  And you can play with them.
[25852.40s -> 25857.44s]  And then the game thinks you're still winning, so it keeps amplifying your MMR.
[25857.44s -> 25861.52s]  So I'm describing this really poorly, but essentially you can duo in lower ELOs,
[25861.52s -> 25866.16s]  and the game doesn't know your MMR belongs in that ELO because you're winning in
[25866.16s -> 25867.16s]  that ELO.
[25867.16s -> 25870.42s]  The game can't figure that out for some reason, the algorithm.
[25870.42s -> 25877.46s]  So when they stopped duo queuing, it still inflated their MMR to where it would be if
[25877.46s -> 25879.34s]  they had solo queued.
[25879.34s -> 25881.94s]  Does that make sense?
[25881.94s -> 25886.26s]  So it basically says that they went like 10-0 in their placements.
[25886.26s -> 25891.62s]  So now they're in like a master tier MMR from a brand new account.
[25891.62s -> 25899.47s]  So now those people are in D1 Masters MMR, but they won in gold.
[25899.47s -> 25909.97s]  I also don't think smurfing should be so easily accessible.
[25909.97s -> 25914.77s]  This guy's not a bad player per se, but I don't think he's a master tier player.
[25914.77s -> 25918.01s]  This guy's a rumble player on a new account.
[25918.01s -> 25940.63s]  From that game alone, the fact he gave up tells me he's not a good player.
[25940.63s -> 25949.33s]  I'm a heavy advocate for Riot, you have to attach a verification to your accounts.
[25949.33s -> 25953.87s]  I know Riot would never do that, but I'm a heavy advocate for having to attach verification
[25953.87s -> 25957.27s]  to play ranked.
[25957.27s -> 25961.90s]  I think it would be great, honestly.
[25961.90s -> 25975.25s]  I think it would help so much.
[25975.25s -> 25977.65s]  If you get your verification account banned, are you done for it?
[25977.65s -> 25978.65s]  Yeah.
[25978.65s -> 25981.21s]  You have to get a VPN to play other than you would have to.
[25981.21s -> 25983.93s]  That's my point though.
[25983.93s -> 25989.93s]  If you get your verified account banned, that account's done.
[25989.93s -> 26011.90s]  Like I said, I don't think Riot would ever do it because it's too extreme and I don't
[26011.90s -> 26014.14s]  think Riot has the balls to ever do that shit.
[26014.14s -> 26016.34s]  VPN is only $5.
[26016.34s -> 26019.98s]  But dude, are you gonna tell me that you're gonna buy it?
[26019.98s -> 26023.94s]  People who get banned on accounts typically get banned consistently, that's why they're
[26023.94s -> 26027.38s]  making smurfs.
[26027.38s -> 26031.86s]  So you're telling me somebody is going to be willing to pay $5 for a new phone number
[26031.86s -> 26034.18s]  verification or whatever?
[26034.18s -> 26036.18s]  Every time they have to make a new account?
[26036.18s -> 26047.66s]  They're not.
[26047.66s -> 26048.66s]  Not you, me.
[26048.66s -> 26049.66s]  Lulu.
[26049.66s -> 26050.66s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26050.66s -> 26051.66s]  Okay.
[26051.66s -> 26052.66s]  Don't I have smurfs?
[26052.66s -> 26053.66s]  Yeah, I do.
[26053.66s -> 26059.06s]  And I stand by, all my smurfs should be attached to the same, like, account.
[26059.06s -> 26064.54s]  Like, if you make a smurf, okay, this is what I think should happen.
[26064.54s -> 26067.50s]  You should be able to put all of your smurfs on one account.
[26067.50s -> 26073.94s]  So you can make smurfs and you can add that smurf verification to an account.
[26073.94s -> 26074.94s]  But it kind of like battle.net.
[26074.94s -> 26075.94s]  Does that make sense?
[26075.94s -> 26080.10s]  You know how like battle.net has all your accounts in the battle.net thing, but you
[26080.10s -> 26082.14s]  can sign in to battle.net?
[26082.14s -> 26087.40s]  I think that the way to make it viable would be like you could put all, if you didn't
[26087.40s -> 26091.58s]  have a second phone number or didn't want one, you could put smurfs up to like a limit.
[26091.58s -> 26095.22s]  So you could have like three smurfs or like two smurfs in your main account, right?
[26095.22s -> 26097.40s]  So you could have like three total accounts.
[26097.40s -> 26099.12s]  And you would have to like,
[26099.12s -> 26102.80s]  you could add those to the same like Omega account, right?
[26102.80s -> 26105.44s]  And that Omega account could be your verified account.
[26105.44s -> 26107.52s]  Now, if any of your accounts get punished
[26107.52s -> 26115.30s]  on your Omega account, all of your accounts get punished.
[26115.30s -> 26116.62s]  So if any of your accounts get punished,
[26116.62s -> 26130.04s]  all of them get punished.
[26130.04s -> 26132.28s]  Like I feel like that'd be a good play.
[26132.28s -> 26134.28s]  Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like it would work.
[26134.28s -> 26135.52s]  Yo, what's up Rush?
[26135.52s -> 26141.01s]  I called you Rush, what's up RF?
[26141.01s -> 26142.51s]  Ah, what do I wanna play?
[26143.77s -> 26144.61s]  I don't know.
[26145.45s -> 26149.06s]  I don't know what I wanna do here.
[26149.06s -> 26151.38s]  It's helpful, ranged, okay.
[26151.38s -> 26152.66s]  I wish I didn't have cleanse.
[26152.66s -> 26155.02s]  Cleans is so worthless, this game, actually.
[26156.78s -> 26159.46s]  Cleans does nothing this game at all.
[26159.46s -> 26160.90s]  I'm just down to some.
[26160.90s -> 26163.42s]  Like maybe if the brand tries to flash stun me
[26163.42s -> 26179.04s]  or some shit, but I'm just down to summoner.
[26179.04s -> 26180.82s]  All right, boys.
[26180.82s -> 26185.85s]  We got Nightblue 3 on our team.
[26185.85s -> 26260.80s]  a throwback. Damn. Oh, we got him. I'm not gonna lie. I kinda looked like I was scripting.
[26260.80s -> 26265.12s]  That movement, like, if I was watching the game, I'd be like, what the fuck was that?
[26265.12s -> 26272.32s]  Like, my movement was real sus on that, like, that all in right there. That's some, that's
[26272.32s -> 26307.89s]  some, that's some sus movement. We can gank these guys. They have no, oh, there's
[26307.89s -> 26323.16s]  gonna be a ward in here. These people have no flashes. Enemy bot lane has no flash, this
[26323.16s -> 26328.84s]  should be a free kill honestly. We just let these guys push in, they can't walk up and
[26328.84s -> 26337.88s]  we just play for that. Even if they try and 3v3, we should just win the 3v3 because
[26337.88s -> 26363.88s]  we're stronger. Oh this guy's just dead, yeah it's... I need level 3. I kinda fucked
[26363.88s -> 26390.68s]  my entire wave here. Yo can we push? Is there any way we can just push this? Ooh nice. Nice
[26390.68s -> 26405.66s]  well played. Nice job. My Lulu's fucking fed his shit. Oh I should have gone free boots
[26405.66s -> 26413.70s]  this game. I didn't even think about it. Cuz I don't need Sork this game. You know
[26413.70s -> 26416.34s]  You know how like the last game I told you I was going boots?
[26416.34s -> 26421.02s]  I went boots for the uh, you know the fast boot 2 rush for Thresh.
[26421.02s -> 26430.26s]  I don't need that this game because we just went through like faster mythic.
[26430.26s -> 26433.46s]  So I should have gone free boots for like more efficiency.
[26433.46s -> 26445.06s]  Can't understand, not just kill a man.
[26445.06s -> 26469.37s]  You can't understand, not just kill a man.
[26469.37s -> 26500.19s]  I want to push this wave so we don't get like shit on.
[26500.19s -> 26503.11s]  I'm gonna just kill a man.
[26503.11s -> 26505.63s]  You can't understand.
[26505.63s -> 26511.23s]  Just kill a man.
[26511.23s -> 26512.23s]  Kill a man.
[26512.23s -> 26516.35s]  There is something you can't understand.
[26516.35s -> 26544.83s]  Kill a man.
[26544.83s -> 26558.84s]  I could go back here, but I don't see any reason to go back yet.
[26558.84s -> 26565.70s]  I think I'm dead.
[26565.70s -> 26566.78s]  I misplayed that.
[26566.78s -> 26568.50s]  That was actually really good by Lula, cool dance.
[26568.50s -> 26570.10s]  No, you're fine, man.
[26570.10s -> 26572.82s]  I wish I could tell him that he played it fine.
[26572.82s -> 26576.52s]  I messed up, not him, I messed up.
[26576.52s -> 26584.05s]  Ah, I feel bad, I wanna like say no, you're fine.
[26584.05s -> 26585.81s]  Cause that was my bad.
[26585.81s -> 26587.57s]  I should've, okay, so when I flashed
[26587.57s -> 26589.49s]  and I was running away from the Twitch, right?
[26589.49s -> 26591.13s]  The second that Twitch flashed on me,
[26591.13s -> 26593.61s]  I should've instantly started autoing him.
[26593.61s -> 26595.25s]  Like, it was one extra auto,
[26595.25s -> 26597.21s]  like one single extra auto,
[26597.21s -> 26602.24s]  and it would've been fine.
[26602.24s -> 26606.38s]  Why can't I tell her?
[26606.38s -> 26608.18s]  You know, I just choose not to type anymore.
[26609.18s -> 26609.98s]  It's my choice.
[26613.14s -> 26613.64s]  You know.
[26615.75s -> 26616.25s]  Yeah.
[26620.27s -> 26620.87s]  My choice.
[26639.68s -> 26641.28s]  Alright guys, actually doing that, huh?
[26641.38s -> 26641.88s]  Wow.
[26644.69s -> 26646.69s]  We win to be too really fucking hard.
[26647.79s -> 26649.99s]  Especially with tier 2 boots, but I need a...
[26665.14s -> 26666.94s]  Dude, I'm doing some scripty shit.
[26667.74s -> 26668.44s]  I don't wanna be real.
[26674.20s -> 26675.70s]  Dude, Lulu wasn't 6.
[26676.40s -> 26677.50s]  I thought she was 6.
[26677.80s -> 26678.80s]  I'm so bad.
[26682.02s -> 26683.42s]  I wish I could tell her my bad again.
[26683.42s -> 26685.42s]  I'm actually trolling
[26686.18s -> 26689.86s]  Like I ran out of mana because I'm bad and then I
[26690.74s -> 26695.12s]  And then I thought she was six
[26695.12s -> 26699.40s]  So I walked up to like take tank deterrent for a second right because I was like oh shit
[26699.40s -> 26704.52s]  Maybe I'll get like maybe we can kill this guy. Maybe Lulu has a spell or something. I just oh, I played bad my bad
[26710.62s -> 26712.14s]  W that make sure
[26712.14s -> 26722.33s]  Echoes not there. I feel I actually just feel so bad because the Lulu is actually playing really it's like the best support
[26722.33s -> 26723.49s]  I've had all day
[26723.49s -> 26727.29s]  Like this guy's actually impressing me, right? Like this guy's playing really well
[26727.97s -> 26760.50s]  And I'm just griefing
[26760.50s -> 26765.54s]  Lulu gave her life for me
[26765.58s -> 26772.36s]  Lulu gave her life for me boys. Can we get a salute for Lulu and chat boys?
[26773.44s -> 26774.96s]  Do we get a salute?
[26774.96s -> 26778.78s]  Can we get some love for Lulu?
[26779.90s -> 26788.50s]  She gave her life for the homie
[26803.95s -> 26806.87s]  Honestly that was a really cool 2v2 by the way
[26808.59s -> 26810.59s]  Oh, night was smurfing it what the fuck?
[26811.51s -> 26812.83s]  Yo, kill that bitch too!
[26829.61s -> 26830.81s]  Niiiice!
[26840.25s -> 26840.75s]  No!
[26840.75s -> 26841.95s]  Ooooooh!
[26843.35s -> 26845.15s]  If I lost that cannon, I would have lost my life.
[26846.35s -> 26846.85s]  End game.
[26876.35s -> 26878.15s]  Uh, I'm gonna go BT second item.
[26878.55s -> 26879.35s]  We have Lulu?
[26879.65s -> 26881.65s]  Uh, so, wait, what the fuck is this pathing?
[26883.35s -> 26885.55s]  I clicked to go bot and it pats me in the weirdest spot ever.
[26885.65s -> 26891.45s]  We have Lulu, so I could actually go IE second, but I think if I go BT, I'll be actually unkillable.
[26892.95s -> 26894.75s]  Like, it'll be the greatest thing ever.
[26894.85s -> 26902.16s]  I actually still might go IE as I'm thinking about it that loud by saying we have Lulu and not be stupid, but hey
[26902.72s -> 26906.36s]  Okay, I still might you know, I still might go IE, but I don't know yet
[26906.36s -> 26909.08s]  We'll see because I took a Lackardy so it's like
[26910.28s -> 26925.11s]  Wow
[26925.11s -> 26951.04s]  No, I'm gonna die. I mean, I don't know why I flashed away
[26952.88s -> 26955.88s]  I'm playing bad. It's my fault. I
[26957.16s -> 26959.48s]  Think the game's over. So I'm just I'm playing bad
[26959.48s -> 26961.60s]  I'm like limit-testing a little bit too much
[26972.57s -> 26993.42s]  today
[27045.45s -> 27063.05s]  Price they haven't for put it though. What the fuck dude. How does this game? Oh, I'm even more mad you guys have no idea
[27064.13s -> 27066.13s]  so I
[27066.13s -> 27074.13s]  It's 24 to 8, the enemy team doesn't forfeit, but my team forfeits when the score is 10 to 14,
[27074.13s -> 27078.13s]  and we're only down a thousand golds.
[27078.13s -> 27098.19s]  Sorry, that was my bad.
[27098.19s -> 27105.82s]  I was tilted by, you know, I was thinking about how they weren't forfeiting and I was getting mad.
[27105.82s -> 27109.82s]  It is a little interesting because like I said, they still can't win.
[27109.82s -> 27112.82s]  So I don't know who the fuck's heading no, but it's probably Echo.
[27112.82s -> 27115.06s]  Well, no, I was definitely heading no but like who else
[27116.90s -> 27123.49s]  Maybe brands maybe ribbon maybe ribbons like yeah
[27124.07s -> 27132.28s]  They just get a thousand gold
[27132.28s -> 27139.14s]  Alright, I should probably stop trolling. I'd feel pretty silly if we lost cuz I'm bad
[27139.78s -> 27141.62s]  After we like dumpster them and laying that art
[27141.62s -> 27144.18s]  I feel pretty silly if we lost because I keep getting caught
[27144.66s -> 27163.52s]  All right, I should be unkillable now
[27163.68s -> 27168.10s]  Like I'm not even farming. I'm actually griefing. I
[27168.86s -> 27170.56s]  Should probably go make dinner after this game
[27170.56s -> 27175.44s]  I want to keep playing because I'm playing well today, but like dude my brain is starting to go like
[27175.92s -> 27180.84s]  Like I probably need to go make some food. I'm getting the full ADHD brain experience going
[27181.28s -> 27196.13s]  So let's see if I can muster all my focus
[27196.73s -> 27203.47s]  Let's see if I can muster up all my focus really quick just for
[27204.15s -> 27205.99s]  Push out and finish this game
[27205.99s -> 27212.23s]  We'll go terminator mode for the the end of this game right now
[27212.69s -> 27215.13s]  We'll muster up all of the all of the focus
[27224.11s -> 27227.19s]  Demon mode engaged boys. God that was sounded really cringe
[27277.71s -> 27283.62s]  I'm actually really impressed though, Nightblue played this game really, really well, like I'll be honest.
[27284.32s -> 27288.02s]  My last, like, thought of Nightblue was him being bad at League.
[27289.62s -> 27291.72s]  He played this game really well.
[27295.21s -> 27296.51s]  My man's gotten so much better.
[27303.14s -> 27304.34s]  Okay, nobody saw that.
[27304.84s -> 27310.64s]  Nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that, nobody saw that.
[27310.94s -> 27313.74s]  Not one of you saw me flash after the Echo wall, did not one of you.
[27321.82s -> 27324.02s]  Wasted flash? No, that was asserted flash.
[27324.42s -> 27326.66s]  An assertive dominant flash
[27327.80s -> 27338.80s]  Not wasted at all. They might actually go for Baron here. We should look for this
[27340.64s -> 27351.10s]  Like they could try oh he's here pretty sure the ribbons here too though
[27352.82s -> 27355.42s]  Yep, I did not mean to do that I
[27356.42s -> 27359.02s]  Didn't mean to hit the thing. I accidentally hit the blast plans
[27360.46s -> 27363.54s]  That was that was an accident. It was a it was a literal pure accidents
[27366.35s -> 27367.95s]  like I
[27367.95s -> 27371.47s]  I did not mean to hit it. I was like, I know Riven's here
[27371.47s -> 27376.71s]  I'm gonna wait for Yasuo before I go over or before I do this right and I'm gonna bait him and I just
[27376.79s -> 27381.59s]  Completely whiffed every like I'm bad. We'll leave it at I'm bad. That's a good way to put I'm bad
[27381.99s -> 27385.71s]  I'm hungry. I'm old. I'm bald. I'm bad. Nothing else to say
[27386.87s -> 27388.87s]  Short to short mad
[27402.61s -> 27405.13s]  Yeah, that was a pedestrian flash
[27406.33s -> 27410.17s]  It is she as well. Oh, yeah, it's a plethora a plethora
[27410.85s -> 27418.04s]  Terrible things. I still got to go to the gym tonight, too
[27442.75s -> 27444.37s]  Dead spot
[27444.37s -> 27445.73s]  Okay
[27445.73s -> 27447.73s]  I'm a little nervous of like getting flanked
[27449.13s -> 27451.35s]  Right their junglers could just like sit in places
[27452.09s -> 27470.76s]  Nice. We got top in him not bad
[27471.56s -> 27473.56s]  Yeah, I mean we just try and get mid and hip here
[27475.22s -> 27477.22s]  Well, let's go help our homie though
[27477.72s -> 27500.58s]  Like I'm actually so sad. I'm playing so bad
[27501.90s -> 27504.60s]  Like I was playing so good at the start and now I'm playing so bad
[27505.36s -> 27506.64s]  That actually makes me sad.
[27516.31s -> 27517.75s]  I was tanking for that guy.
[27529.38s -> 27530.54s]  Alright, let's just leave.
[27538.97s -> 27542.69s]  I don't wanna- I don't wanna throw the game for my- my teammates.
[27543.05s -> 27544.81s]  Cause like, I'm getting like, you know...
[27545.53s -> 27546.33s]  Bzzz.
[27547.33s -> 27549.69s]  I've already died five times, like a dipshit.
[27574.82s -> 27575.66s]  Oh, where'd he go?
[27581.74s -> 27583.30s]  We should just push bot, honestly.
[27584.98s -> 27586.22s]  We don't even need this dragon.
[27596.22s -> 27598.22s]  Okay, we should- we're just- I'm just gonna push bot.
[27644.18s -> 27645.18s]  Not bad!
[27658.88s -> 27660.24s]  Not bad at all.
[27660.24s -> 27663.28s]  I gotta give it to I want to give it to night blue, but I gotta give it to this Lulu
[27664.32s -> 27671.33s]  Lulu played that game so good. I gotta give it to Lulu. She played so fucking good
[27676.04s -> 27693.63s]  Like actually, I don't even know if she's still in here
[27712.58s -> 27721.91s]  I'm not a scripter
[27721.99s -> 27723.99s]  She thinks I'm a no, I'm serious
[27732.63s -> 27734.63s]  She thinks I'm a scripter
[27739.24s -> 27758.74s]  Bro, I'm streaming
[27759.18s -> 27765.22s]  The homie thought I'm a scripter, you know, I'll take it
[27765.50s -> 27776.17s]  My ego feels good.
[27776.17s -> 27777.41s]  Honestly, that feels good.
[27777.41s -> 27778.97s]  That feels good.
[27778.97s -> 27784.14s]  Hi, Lil.
[27784.14s -> 27784.98s]  Thought it was a script.
[27784.98s -> 27786.54s]  Dude, I'm not gonna lie, though.
[27786.54s -> 27790.30s]  Some of those movements were sus as fuck that I was making.
[27790.30s -> 27792.50s]  Like, I was, I like turned on
[27792.50s -> 27794.98s]  the fucking mental scripts for that game.
[27794.98s -> 27799.98s]  Some of those movements early were nuts.
[27799.98s -> 27802.90s]  Like, just like this tiny little,
[27802.90s -> 27805.38s]  tiny little movements I was doing early game in lane
[27805.38s -> 27806.82s]  were crazy.
[27806.82s -> 27808.46s]  Like, look at this, watch this.
[27808.46s -> 27809.66s]  Like this movement right here, right?
[27809.66s -> 27827.16s]  look I dodge that right then I walk up cleanse the thing kite down like that
[27827.16s -> 27834.98s]  that movement is gross man look that was actually some gross ass movement I'm
[27834.98s -> 27849.02s]  not gonna lie we this in the corner man in the corner my brain was like you know
[27849.02s -> 27853.78s]  andromeda thank you man yo you played really good now I felt bad I felt so
[27853.78s -> 27858.84s]  bad because I was griefing like I was like at the start of the game we were
[27858.84s -> 27863.50s]  just snow like I literally fucked up like three times during like the really
[27863.50s -> 27872.32s]  important fights and I was like oh no yeah thank you the best can I play
[27872.32s -> 27881.31s]  Calista I can I'm trying to figure out if I want to play a Calista game or if I
[27881.31s -> 27891.23s]  want to go make dinner there was one other movement that I thought was kind
[27891.23s -> 27894.83s]  of nuts I did a really good movement to somewhere I don't remember what it
[27894.83s -> 27903.64s]  was. Here's where I fucked up. So right now, I should have just been, for some reason my
[27903.64s -> 27909.36s]  brain lagged and I should have just been sitting here. I should have just cleansed and then
[27909.36s -> 27914.16s]  started fighting the Twitch. For some reason I didn't cleanse, but this wasn't like your
[27914.16s -> 27918.20s]  fault at all. Like I, the second the Twitch flashed, I should have insta cleansed the
[27918.20s -> 27921.92s]  ignite and I should have just been killing him. Like right now, just like autoing
[27921.92s -> 27925.20s]  because I can't get away from him, right? But it took me an extra second. See how
[27925.20s -> 27927.20s]  I start fighting him now
[27929.59s -> 27936.15s]  Like I barely died. I wouldn't have died had I cleansed and had I just turned initially it was fine
[27936.99s -> 27946.38s]  And then like here I fucked up too because I went in and I thought we were six. Oh
[27954.38s -> 27956.38s]  I could have killed that guy. I
[27957.06s -> 27960.78s]  Should have gone forward one more. Oh, you know what I should have done there
[27960.78s -> 27963.42s]  I should have gone forward one more auto killed this guy
[27963.70s -> 27965.86s]  Lulu would have gotten six off of the kill
[27965.86s -> 27970.50s]  I would have used my speed to come back out then she could have altered me. We could have killed the
[27971.54s -> 27984.32s]  We could have got the twitch and then we could have turned on this echo too. Oh, this was a really cool 2v2. I
[27985.56s -> 27987.56s]  Actually thought this 2v2 was really sick
[27992.53s -> 27996.65s]  Lulu is a real one for this man. Listen. You're a real one for this one
[27997.29s -> 27999.61s]  You just took the death to save me
[28004.64s -> 28006.20s]  respect
[28006.20s -> 28012.65s]  Your real one for that
[28012.65s -> 28019.35s]  That was so good
[28019.35s -> 28022.51s]  Jesus was fun. Yeah, geez you were the best support I've had today
[28022.95s -> 28027.17s]  Like legitimately you played better than all the other players in the sealer. That was really good
[28027.39s -> 28033.41s]  Like I was surprised I was telling my stream. I was like, yeah, this she's actually like they I said she cuz you're a little
[28033.41s -> 28035.41s]  I don't know, you know, but I was like, yeah
[28036.03s -> 28039.53s]  She's playing super good. She's playing way better than all of my fucking teammates
[28044.38s -> 28049.50s]  Yo, what time is it six man do I want to
[28050.14s -> 28056.16s]  So I want to keep streaming or do I want to go get food and go to the gym?
[28056.16s -> 28059.86s]  I can't, like 24 hour fitness is not actually 24 anymore.
[28059.86s -> 28067.02s]  So I'd have to go soon if I'm going to go to the gym.
[28067.02s -> 28081.36s]  But it is only like six.
[28081.36s -> 28087.56s]  But I could just end on, I could just end on hitting the like 400 LP mark and just
[28087.56s -> 28088.56s]  chill for now.
[28088.56s -> 28091.77s]  Right?
[28091.77s -> 28092.77s]  Like we hit 400 LP.
[28092.77s -> 28096.13s]  We'll probably hit GM tomorrow.
[28096.13s -> 28101.55s]  So I could just chill for now, and then we could just hit GM tomorrow.
[28101.55s -> 28105.35s]  That's probably a better idea, because then I won't get mad.
[28105.35s -> 28110.19s]  Say we get another game like this, right?
[28110.19s -> 28114.19s]  Say we get another game like this, where we're literally winning the game, and my team's
[28114.19s -> 28115.19s]  like, no, let's forfeit.
[28115.19s -> 28116.19s]  That's going to make me mad.
[28116.19s -> 28117.19s]  I was mad.
[28117.19s -> 28119.27s]  This is going to make me mad, right?
[28119.27s -> 28123.39s]  So I'd rather just get off on a good note, like a happy note, not be tilted.
[28123.39s -> 28130.38s]  GM tomorrow?
[28130.38s -> 28131.38s]  Yeah, I hope so.
[28131.38s -> 28136.38s]  I think I can get Challenger back this year, but we gotta get to GM first.
[28136.38s -> 28140.30s]  I'm telling you, this elo is so miserable.
[28140.30s -> 28149.98s]  Master Tier is the worst elo I've ever played in my 12 years of playing this game.
[28149.98s -> 28157.66s]  Whatever NA 300, 400 LP Masters is, is literally disgusting.
[28157.66s -> 28159.78s]  These are not real people.
[28159.78s -> 28167.30s]  I feel like half of these games we are playing with NPCs who quite literally don't even
[28167.30s -> 28172.14s]  like I don't even know what to say, they're bots and they can't be real humans.
[28172.14s -> 28177.62s]  They get mad over nothing, they rage quit over nothing, they give up at 15 minutes when
[28177.62s -> 28179.50s]  we're winning the game.
[28179.50s -> 28182.97s]  These cannot be real people.
[28182.97s -> 28187.41s]  So I swear to God, the game has to get better in GM.
[28187.41s -> 28189.25s]  It has to get better.
[28189.25s -> 28193.37s]  There's no WORLD that it gets worse.
[28193.37s -> 28195.61s]  Like I refuse to believe that.
[28195.61s -> 28203.02s]  Cause this is the worst grind I've ever had.
[28203.02s -> 28206.89s]  Is it bad to be a bot?
[28206.89s -> 28207.89s]  Are you saying I'm BOTTIST?
[28207.89s -> 28211.14s]  Are you gonna cancel me?
[28211.14s -> 28213.38s]  Because I don't like bots?
[28213.38s -> 28214.38s]  I said it.
[28214.38s -> 28215.38s]  I'm saying it.
[28215.38s -> 28216.38s]  I don't like fucking bots.
[28216.38s -> 28217.38s]  Whoa.
[28217.38s -> 28219.10s]  Okay, I didn't need to add fuck.
[28219.10s -> 28220.10s]  You know what?
[28220.10s -> 28221.10s]  I'm gonna get off.
[28221.10s -> 28222.10s]  Yeah, that's it.
[28222.10s -> 28223.10s]  That's it for me.
[28223.10s -> 28224.58s]  I'm gonna get off, boys.
[28224.58s -> 28225.58s]  I'm tired.
[28225.58s -> 28229.18s]  I need to go to the gym before I run out of juice, make some dinner.
[28229.18s -> 28231.88s]  Uh, I will be live tomorrow, same time as today.
[28231.88s -> 28234.98s]  I've been starting my stream at 10am, my time.
[28234.98s -> 28240.08s]  Maybe I'll do it tomorrow at 9am, I don't know, it's 10 or 9.
[28240.08s -> 28241.98s]  Between there, I always start my stream.
[28241.98s -> 28247.48s]  And so, uh, and that's my time, so it's like 7, 8, 9, PST.
[28247.48s -> 28248.88s]  You're good at AD.
[28248.88s -> 28250.68s]  Thanks man, I think I suck.
[28250.68s -> 28254.78s]  My goal is, hopefully I can get Challenger back.
[28254.78s -> 28261.06s]  And then I'm not gonna play like I just want to my goal is challenger so that I can prove to myself
[28262.14s -> 28264.14s]  It's a really stupid thing
[28264.14s -> 28266.84s]  But I want to prove to myself that I can still do it at 32
[28267.26s -> 28270.50s]  Because 10 years ago was the first time I started streaming this year, right?
[28270.50s -> 28274.06s]  I've been streaming for 10 years this year and so I want to get challenger
[28275.10s -> 28279.10s]  Because when I first started streaming I was in challenger and I want to see if like after 10 years
[28279.10s -> 28283.50s]  I can still do it and then I'm never gonna care again
[28283.50s -> 28287.18s]  This will be the only time I ever give a shit about getting challenger
[28287.18s -> 28290.74s]  I just want to get it see if I care and then play for content, you know
[28292.34s -> 28296.56s]  But uh, yeah, it's just it's like welcome to the league of Draven
[28297.38s -> 28300.82s]  See if the old man who has fucking arthritis and
[28301.58s -> 28305.14s]  Fucking carpal tunnel and all that shit, you know what I mean see if I still do it

[28328.30s -> 28332.58s]  stream on Saturday I might do some off-stream grinding on Saturday I've
[28332.58s -> 28335.34s]  been taking I've been like forcing myself to take a day off of streaming
[28335.34s -> 28340.02s]  every week just so like I can mentally recharge and I think it's actually been
[28340.02s -> 28343.78s]  really good for my stream because like I've been in a much better mood while
[28343.78s -> 28347.94s]  streaming and I've been much less tilted and I've been even if I play League off
[28347.94s -> 28351.82s]  stream or whatever it's just like it doesn't feel as forced so I feel like
[28351.82s -> 28355.50s]  the break's nice so yeah tomorrow no stream on Saturday tomorrow for sure and
[28355.50s -> 28359.78s]  Sunday I might I might do a short stream but yeah I'll see you guys then
[28359.78s -> 28365.42s]  thanks for watching I appreciate it guys and yeah that's it I'm gonna go
