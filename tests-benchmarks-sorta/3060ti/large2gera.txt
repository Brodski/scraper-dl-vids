[190.19s -> 195.62s]  Yeah, that guy has
[195.78s -> 196.98s]  GP
[196.98s -> 215.50s]  bees
[215.50s -> 216.90s]  Jesus
[216.90s -> 256.05s]  Yo, hey, what's up, man?
[256.05s -> 318.94s]  What's up, dudes?
[318.94s -> 320.94s]  Yeah, I mean we're hoping
[321.18s -> 327.57s]  We'll see man. We'll see
[330.25s -> 390.91s]  Fingers fucking crossed, right? Do I ever actually?
[392.15s -> 462.88s]  I'm wondering if I I'm assuming I'm just playing a math. No way. Yay
[463.66s -> 484.12s]  Yeah, this is probably just me doing fucking I'm probably just doing Star Guardian
[498.34s -> 502.54s]  Welcome to the 27 months, man. You're wrong
[503.54s -> 530.98s]  Appreciate it a lot, dude. Thank you, and I could probably still go infinite team, but so I'm holding the solution
[531.72s -> 533.72s]  But I haven't seen any servers or anything
[534.78s -> 619.93s]  So I'd be kind of awkward, you know, this guy's definitely gonna beat me that guy's I
[621.01s -> 625.21s]  See why he hasn't lost that's his five infinity team already. Jesus Christ. I
[626.29s -> 628.97s]  Was like man, why is that guy so strong and then I like realized?
[629.55s -> 780.82s]  So I go to seven next rounds and then hopefully we can hit
[782.14s -> 806.36s]  Some shit. I kind of like this actually because now we can make I
[807.56s -> 809.28s]  can actually make a
[809.28s -> 811.28s]  Guard breaker and I can also make
[811.78s -> 848.96s]  We go like guard breaker ms. I kind of want to just ionic spark, but I don't know if I should I need
[850.36s -> 852.36s]  an echo a
[852.40s -> 854.40s]  Nico or a round
[854.40s -> 857.40s]  I also could use an Ezreal. I need like a quick draw.
[858.40s -> 876.02s]  I should have kept that Lucian from earlier.
[876.02s -> 880.02s]  This guy has a level 3 Blitzcrank and he's just so fucking strong it's stupid.
[880.02s -> 950.92s]  This is really interesting.
[950.92s -> 975.23s]  I guess I could go Spellslinger as well.
[975.23s -> 978.23s]  And we can just give the Shiv to TF.
[978.23s -> 1007.98s]  We can just do this for now too.
[1007.98s -> 1037.21s]  I guess I could use...
[1037.21s -> 1042.18s]  I could do Jeweled Gauntlet.
[1042.18s -> 1044.50s]  I don't know.
[1044.50s -> 1048.51s]  I could Jeweled Gauntlet this shit up.
[1048.51s -> 1107.43s]  up see how it goes I need to like throw an item down but I feel like Morellos is
[1107.43s -> 1119.66s]  bad I guess I could just use hat or like I said before jeweled gauntlet could be
[1119.66s -> 1152.98s]  good I don't know I could just roll on seven to trying three star stuff this guy
[1152.98s -> 1161.06s]  has three Kaisas though this guy has one Kaisa kind of hard to three star Kaisa I
[1161.06s -> 1190.74s]  Like a 3 star Nyla
[1190.74s -> 1192.74s]  Like a 8 with fucking 20 gold
[1194.74s -> 1196.74s]  Here he has MF
[1196.74s -> 1198.74s]  And
[1198.74s -> 1354.08s]  Dude Blitzcrank's insane
[1354.08s -> 1356.08s]  Dude that Gnar just merked me
[1356.08s -> 1358.08s]  I did not position for the Gnar
[1358.08s -> 1360.08s]  And I got
[1360.08s -> 1371.26s]  Fucked for it
[1371.26s -> 1399.86s]  This motherfucker
[1399.86s -> 1401.86s]  Dude I wish I could get some
[1401.86s -> 1403.86s]  Thick frontline leveled up
[1403.86s -> 1419.14s]  That'd be cool
[1424.75s -> 1543.83s]  Oh my god another Gnar, well RIP.
[1543.83s -> 1548.27s]  I was going to go MF and then I decided to go Neeko and then I just fucked it all up.
[1548.27s -> 1551.29s]  Oh well.
[1551.29s -> 1571.46s]  Oh well.
[1571.46s -> 1595.86s]  What time is it, 10?
[1595.86s -> 1596.86s]  Okay.
[1596.86s -> 1597.86s]  Oh.
[1597.86s -> 1598.86s]  What's up boys?
[1598.86s -> 1599.86s]  How's everybody doing?
[1599.86s -> 1613.25s]  Oh I'll be right back.
[1613.25s -> 1614.25s]  Sorry I'm still waking up.
[1614.25s -> 1615.25s]  Let me, let me just get my phone out of my pocket.
[1615.25s -> 1619.35s]  I'll be right back.
[1619.35s -> 1620.35s]  Oh my god.
[1620.35s -> 1621.35s]  Oh my god.
[1621.35s -> 1634.54s]  Oh my god.
[1634.54s -> 1635.54s]  Oh my god.
[1635.54s -> 1643.62s]  Oh my god.
[1643.62s -> 1644.62s]  Oh my god.
[1644.62s -> 1683.16s]  give me one sec what's up sky oh okay oh yeah baby i was gonna play on my main at the start but dude
[1683.16s -> 1686.76s]  i don't know if i can sit through fucking eight minute queue times to get people raging at each
[1686.76s -> 1704.74s]  other all day so we'll uh we'll do some warm-up on this account for a bit what a marz account like
[1704.74s -> 1718.38s]  d1 low master like my other accounts like 500 this one's i want to say like i don't know the
[1718.38s -> 1722.30s]  The MMR is really awkward when you get like low masters, right?
[1722.30s -> 1724.00s]  Like the MMR is super awkward.
[1724.00s -> 1725.38s]  So I don't know what the MMR is,
[1725.38s -> 1726.58s]  but I know it's low masters.
[1726.58s -> 1727.94s]  So like sometimes there's diamonds.
[1727.94s -> 1730.28s]  Sometimes there's like a hundred LP players.
[1731.38s -> 1737.44s]  Somewhere between there.
[1737.44s -> 1743.32s]  Dude, I played some games off stream yesterday.
[1743.32s -> 1745.12s]  I got up to like 400 LP.
[1746.16s -> 1748.40s]  Then I lost three in a row.
[1748.40s -> 1755.66s]  That shit was painful.
[1755.66s -> 1758.66s]  I did int one of Tenacity's games though.
[1758.66s -> 1766.36s]  So that was fun.
[1766.36s -> 1770.32s]  That felt bad.
[1770.32s -> 1772.24s]  No, yeah, straight up, it felt so bad.
[1772.24s -> 1773.88s]  He was doing so good, too.
[1773.88s -> 1775.80s]  Like, I straight up just had a bad game,
[1775.80s -> 1779.79s]  and I felt like shit.
[1779.79s -> 1781.63s]  Look at this shit, I just dropped like eight deaths.
[1781.63s -> 1782.51s]  Look at this shit.
[1785.41s -> 1787.03s]  Like, he was just straight up smurfing
[1787.03s -> 1789.11s]  on the enemy top laner,
[1789.11s -> 1791.15s]  and we all, the entire team,
[1791.15s -> 1795.48s]  just like decided to collectively run it down.
[1795.48s -> 1802.44s]  Like, we all just got shit on.
[1802.44s -> 1804.40s]  This was a really weird game,
[1804.40s -> 1809.67s]  Cause I feel like, uh, that game was like the first game.
[1809.67s -> 1812.95s]  I felt everybody in the game was like actually high GM
[1812.95s -> 1815.37s]  challenger, but they weren't rated that.
[1815.37s -> 1823.02s]  It was a very weird system going on.
[1823.02s -> 1830.32s]  Let's do a Cassiopeia game.
[1830.32s -> 1837.65s]  Like I'll show you guys what I mean in a second.
[1837.65s -> 1844.93s]  I'm assuming I should go this, right?
[1844.93s -> 1846.61s]  This is probably good.
[1846.61s -> 1847.45s]  Or this.
[1848.41s -> 1855.24s]  That's probably good too.
[1855.24s -> 1856.06s]  Oh, well.
[1856.06s -> 1857.76s]  Okay. So yeah, we'll get this stuff.
[1858.88s -> 1861.08s]  Like Niantonso is like,
[1861.08s -> 1865.48s]  He's been challenger for a long time, right? I don't even know who the fuck this guy was
[1867.48s -> 1870.52s]  Some random senna player who's like not playing senna now
[1873.72s -> 1876.20s]  And then this guy was like trying to jungle and just like running it down
[1877.96s -> 1881.24s]  It was I don't even know it was the weirdest game that i've played in a while
[1883.00s -> 1884.28s]  Because like
[1884.28s -> 1886.28s]  My ad carry wasn't bad
[1886.60s -> 1890.68s]  Like this guy is clearly like on a smurf, but I don't know how good he was because he wasn't bad at the game
[1890.68s -> 1899.32s]  the enemy ad carry wasn't bad this guy's also on a smurf it was the weirdest lobby it was like a
[1899.32s -> 1908.63s]  bunch of smurf accounts all playing with each other but it was like a non smurf queue this guy
[1908.63s -> 1926.31s]  was like the only non smurf it was interesting oh do i take ghost here or do i just i thought
[1926.31s -> 1930.71s]  ghosts could be really op versus their team with cassiopeia but maybe i should just take
[1930.71s -> 1939.78s]  I'm gonna try it. Oh
[1940.54s -> 1946.68s]  Somebody dodged cuz yeah, I don't know. I never know. I never know if I should take ghost ignite, whatever
[1948.48s -> 1954.64s]  Cuz I feel like ghost with Cassio's feels like the same things ad carry right same idea where it feels really opie
[1955.20s -> 1974.64s]  Dude, there's so much drama going on in the league community yet again, by the way, like it's it's insane
[1994.52s -> 1996.64s]  Yeah, I don't know man. I I
[1997.84s -> 2001.28s]  Just I'm
[2001.28s -> 2006.72s]  I like I like looking at drama
[2007.32s -> 2008.68s]  cuz like
[2008.68s -> 2016.66s]  Drama is juicy. Like I like looking at drama, but it's also like how are people so stupid?
[2033.54s -> 2035.54s]  yeah, I'm getting like I I
[2036.24s -> 2043.82s]  Don't know man. My view on all of this shit is like I I guess I'm just not hardwired that way
[2043.82s -> 2049.36s]  I I can't mentally wrap my head around being like excited to flirt with underage girls
[2049.36s -> 2062.97s]  or like when like I just I I've never like had the want like it happens so much
[2065.01s -> 2068.21s]  Between like league streamers and non like just it's not even a league thing
[2068.21s -> 2070.21s]  It's just that we're in the league community, right? So you see it more
[2070.73s -> 2072.25s]  dude, like
[2072.25s -> 2074.49s]  well, the the drama is like a
[2075.49s -> 2080.81s]  Decent-sized league streamer who was like getting bigger or whatever like the ad carry streamer cookie roll or whatever
[2081.09s -> 2084.29s]  He was like somebody made a 90 page
[2085.25s -> 2095.94s]  90 pages of Google Doc to basically like expose this guy for like talking a bunch
[2095.94s -> 2101.50s]  like sexually to underage girls not paying his fucking like mods who do work
[2101.50s -> 2117.10s]  for him and like other stuff and I'm like dude yeah how man like just be a
[2117.10s -> 2124.46s]  normal human it's not that bad like I take it from me being a normal dude it's
[2124.46s -> 2206.19s]  not that bad sorry i was distracted no uh yeah i don't know man i i swear to god people are just
[2206.19s -> 2212.99s]  stupid as fuck people are idiots there's got to be some psychological underlying issue with
[2212.99s -> 2221.28s]  people's brains not working but it is what it is huh i've had this barcode account for a while
[2221.28s -> 2239.36s]  dude what is that taric skin you see this look at this taric skin man he's fabulous god damn
[2240.80s -> 2260.44s]  my man's just straight up fabulous people are desperate i just can't like i don't think like
[2260.44s -> 2266.20s]  i've been in a situation where i was like a really really big streamer like much bigger than he is
[2266.20s -> 2269.66s]  And I got like I this is what I'm saying. It's like I understand
[2271.96s -> 2276.52s]  Like all of the crap that gets thrown at you like people will literally message you for no reason
[2277.00s -> 2283.64s]  Like you you do have like fans that have like when I was at my biggest point like you you have fans that are younger
[2284.20s -> 2288.76s]  Girls guy it doesn't matter and like you just gotta like I just never in my mind
[2288.76s -> 2290.92s]  I guess thought like oh i'm gonna flirt with these people like
[2290.92s -> 2296.24s]  It made me like I don't even I wouldn't even I literally didn't even see them as like sexual
[2297.04s -> 2302.55s]  in my brain
[2302.55s -> 2311.02s]  Like it blows my mind and then the fact that like if you like if you look at the Google Doc or whatever
[2311.90s -> 2317.26s]  The fact that like taco like I keep a taco or whatever. It was literally talking to him telling him
[2317.26s -> 2321.74s]  He was doing it like what he was doing was wrong. He was like, yeah, I get it right then. He did it again
[2333.08s -> 2336.32s]  Dude, the set halting the pussy that
[2337.28s -> 2340.36s]  I'll be on it. That may be one of the funniest lines I've ever heard
[2355.04s -> 2361.78s]  Like dude, I mean whatever, you know, I'm not here to kink shame whatever gets people off, you know, maybe maybe maybe that's a fetish
[2361.78s -> 2388.97s]  I don't know
[2394.91s -> 2399.66s]  Safe and sounds either way
[2399.66s -> 2407.86s]  Don't worry, we can not talk about the drama real quick, we can talk about how old and
[2407.86s -> 2426.73s]  washed up Wings of Death is though.
[2426.73s -> 2427.73s]  I'm kidding.
[2427.73s -> 2436.43s]  Yo, did you see, on a lighter note though, did you see Riot?
[2436.43s -> 2439.97s]  There was like a Reddit thread or something where Riot was saying that they're like gonna
[2439.97s -> 2444.75s]  try and do something about smurfing in the next few months.
[2444.75s -> 2458.33s]  I don't know what that means, but can you tell us something involving Wings?
[2458.33s -> 2462.21s]  between us yeah yeah just between us and all the homies yeah yeah in chat yeah yeah nobody
[2462.21s -> 2500.06s]  else say anything it's fine yeah no what's up my chat ain't snitches when i was a teen
[2500.06s -> 2510.82s]  i made a montage of him having breakdowns in my games oh my god that's amazing oh my
[2510.82s -> 2519.14s]  god that's amazing i feel like i need to pay you to see this montage like i will give you
[2519.14s -> 2547.77s]  money I need this this is important to me oh I have dude you should see the I have
[2547.77s -> 2557.23s]  so many rage compilations about me it's crazy so many I had a I had a villain arc
[2557.23s -> 2574.48s]  for sure I feel like it just comes with like being a league streamer but you
[2574.48s -> 2581.94s]  players are not all mentally healthy homie let me tell you take it from me
[2581.94s -> 2607.38s]  and okay I'd like to think I'm not a villain anymore fuck you I really want
[2607.38s -> 2608.22s]  Let's play it.
[2609.62s -> 2614.36s]  Nice.
[2614.36s -> 2616.22s]  Dude, Anivia's roaming.
[2624.66s -> 2627.16s]  Why is their Wukong just sitting top, by the way?
[2628.40s -> 2630.38s]  That's actually hilarious.
[2637.25s -> 2643.80s]  You know what's interesting?
[2643.80s -> 2646.00s]  I feel like Taric actually missed that stun.
[2647.00s -> 2648.22s]  I was kind of side-eyeing that,
[2648.22s -> 2672.00s]  but I feel like he missed that stun somehow.
[2672.00s -> 2673.30s]  I feel like this is the easiest game
[2673.30s -> 2675.14s]  I've ever played, by the way.
[2675.14s -> 2678.86s]  I'm on full autopilot, brain still waking up,
[2678.86s -> 2683.94s]  And I feel like they're just walking into me on repeat. I'm just killing them off. I don't even know what the fuck's going on
[2685.54s -> 2690.80s]  Like they it feels like the enemy team has not like they didn't they didn't like understand we were playing League
[2691.26s -> 2693.70s]  Right, like they queued up and they were like, oh, yeah, this is League
[2694.98s -> 2696.98s]  That's what this feels like
[2697.62s -> 2701.58s]  This is what I imagine if I'd Mike Tyson went into a preschool, you know what I mean? Like this is what this feels like
[2721.80s -> 2723.80s]  much say I
[2733.66s -> 2735.66s]  probably could have killed those guys, but I
[2735.66s -> 2755.86s]  I don't want to the chill. I'm assuming the wukong is gonna come bot soon. There he is.
[2755.86s -> 2772.27s]  Damn it I cleansed late. I actually killed both. That was a late cleanse by me. My bad.
[2772.27s -> 2777.95s]  I don't want to take the risk of a backup. If she stuns me they can one shot me. I should
[2777.95s -> 2783.91s]  have killed the fucking guy though. The wukong. I just backed up too far and then I cleansed
[2783.91s -> 2799.24s]  stun for like really late. Hi Jarrah, what's up man? What's up boys? Good evening, good evening,
[2799.24s -> 2816.15s]  good morning. I don't know where the fuck you guys live so good day. The fuck am I watching?
[2825.99s -> 2841.18s]  Wait that Wukong lived? Whoa bro. Oh and I'm dead. Dude that wall was BS.
[2843.42s -> 2847.02s]  There was like a little hole and then I flashed late because I was like oh I could walk out the
[2847.02s -> 2855.54s]  hole but i couldn't walk out the tiny little hole mother fuckers i shouldn't have even been there
[2855.54s -> 2865.21s]  but like i'm stupid i should just push bot i was like dude that's such a bad fight but i walked
[2865.21s -> 2869.61s]  over to it i was like i'm really fed honestly i probably could have killed him if i didn't uh
[2869.61s -> 2880.92s]  if i like flashed the stun annie stuns the only like most over like i swear if they reduced
[2880.92s -> 2887.40s]  to Annie's stun by like 0.5 seconds she would never get played like actually the only reason
[2887.40s -> 2893.24s]  to play Annie is her stun is just so op because it's like uh it's like the reason they changed
[2893.24s -> 2902.30s]  Taric so long ago where like when you have a point click CC it's typically really broken
[2911.26s -> 2922.81s]  okay i'm just dead does Taric not have ult leveled up at six he didn't level his ulti
[2922.81s -> 2945.33s]  Maybe it's, maybe Terakold sucks.
[2945.33s -> 2947.23s]  Maybe it's underpowered, you know?
[2949.07s -> 2959.46s]  No, yeah, he must have misclicked.
[2959.46s -> 2960.70s]  Honestly, I'm just briefing.
[2960.70s -> 2962.82s]  I'm like playing too aggro for like,
[2963.98s -> 2965.86s]  like I threw my lead because I was like,
[2965.86s -> 2968.06s]  oh shit, I'm gonna walk over and help the homies.
[2968.06s -> 2969.54s]  You never walk over and help the homies
[2969.54s -> 2970.78s]  when the homies are getting shit on,
[2970.78s -> 2974.98s]  because if you have like 900 gold or 1000 gold lead,
[2974.98s -> 2976.86s]  like I did or whatever, you don't wanna do that
[2976.86s -> 2995.50s]  because you'll give mf a ton of kills we're in a good spot now though but i am still a little
[2996.46s -> 3002.93s]  wait taric oh he leveled his ult nice this taric does not know how to play taric by the way
[3005.31s -> 3012.99s]  he's throwing out his stun so awkwardly that's okay though i mean i apparently don't know how
[3012.99s -> 3027.31s]  to play draven so i can't really blame the guy i mean you guys are doing dragon with no smite
[3027.31s -> 3044.91s]  But it seems like doing dragon with no smite.
[3044.91s -> 3052.64s]  I mean we could fight these fights but it's like painful.
[3052.64s -> 3056.21s]  We could easily fight these fights.
[3056.21s -> 3061.63s]  I think a lot of it is just like Taric isn't confident enough to walk up and stun, right?
[3061.63s -> 3063.93s]  Like that's that's what I'm seeing the issue is.
[3063.93s -> 3067.11s]  He's doing the thing where like he's not he doesn't have the confidence to actually walk
[3067.11s -> 3072.13s]  up since he's a melee champ.
[3072.13s -> 3077.85s]  So he's walking up and like taking half his health and it's making him nervous.
[3077.85s -> 3084.95s]  It happens a lot with players who aren't very melee champ centric because melee supports
[3084.95s -> 3087.33s]  are actually pretty risky or they're pretty scary rather.
[3087.33s -> 3098.98s]  Oh, he's totally dead.
[3098.98s -> 3100.66s]  Oh, no, maybe not.
[3100.66s -> 3106.06s]  But yeah, melee supports are scary to play because you have to know when you can get
[3106.06s -> 3110.38s]  a kill by going in because you're going to take damage, right?
[3110.38s -> 3121.71s]  just like the nature of melee supports. Nice. We're coming back in a bit. Not bad. We threw
[3121.71s -> 3129.90s]  a little bit early, but yeah, we're starting to get it back. We're chillin. Taric's a nevergood.
[3129.90s -> 3133.98s]  I'm always confused by Taric because he feels like such a good champion. Like the champion
[3133.98s -> 3142.58s]  itself feels broken as shit. Like whenever I see Taric, I think to myself like, he's
[3142.58s -> 3151.70s]  It's either unkillably like super OP or they're like 0 and 10.
[3151.70s -> 3152.70s]  There's no in between, right?
[3152.70s -> 3155.42s]  Like they either know how to play Taric or they don't is what it feels like.
[3155.42s -> 3170.08s]  Oh, you are.
[3170.08s -> 3171.32s]  I mean, yeah, you are wrong.
[3171.32s -> 3174.76s]  Taric actually requires mechanics.
[3174.76s -> 3175.76s]  That's actually true.
[3175.76s -> 3181.24s]  Whereas like most supports like Nautilus doesn't have mechanics, you know, and like Blitzcrank
[3181.24s -> 3182.24s]  doesn't have mechanics.
[3182.24s -> 3187.76s]  hit their button and if it if it works they they're gonna kill
[3188.24s -> 3191.28s]  whereas like taric after you stun there is like stuff you have to do that does
[3191.28s -> 3211.98s]  make sense or block do you think um
[3211.98s -> 3220.35s]  oh i'm gonna die oh thank god do you think taric's one of
[3220.35s -> 3225.39s]  the harder supports i think he's i think he's pretty hard
[3225.39s -> 3228.75s]  like i don't think he's well i mean he's harder than the other supports like i
[3228.75s -> 3231.07s]  think like i don't think there's a single support
[3231.07s -> 3257.52s]  that's hard i know i'm toxic for that but i stand by it whoa i mean i'm just gonna die i'm not gonna
[3257.52s -> 3263.28s]  try and flash i don't think i should have just flashed over but i kind of got baited by the
[3263.28s -> 3269.20s]  terracolt i wanted to see like if i could fight but there's too much cc i was like oh he's holding
[3269.20s -> 3276.42s]  me let's go i can tell this is a really low evil game because there's so much random deaths like
[3276.42s -> 3282.98s]  I'm falling victim to like I'm autopiloting and like I'm not thinking and I'm just talking to you guys and I'm just dying for free
[3283.54s -> 3287.08s]  But it's like there's so many people just dying for free. It's hilarious
[3287.78s -> 3289.78s]  Thresh? Thresh isn't actually that hard
[3290.42s -> 3292.42s]  so
[3292.66s -> 3297.70s]  Like a lot of people think like Thresh mechanically is very difficult because he is harder than the other supports
[3298.02s -> 3300.50s]  But he's not actually that hard. He's like
[3301.22s -> 3304.26s]  Once you learn the Thresh combos, he's pretty much
[3304.26s -> 3320.24s]  much a very upfront champion. Yeah, like, like lantern, for example, is one of the most
[3320.24s -> 3325.16s]  broken things to ever be put in league and everybody fucks it up. Like people will will
[3325.16s -> 3329.08s]  just mess up lantern because they'll throw it for souls or they'll mess up like, you
[3329.08s -> 3335.76s]  can literally just hold lantern perma and your ad carry can walk up auto the turret
[3335.76s -> 3345.98s]  and and and you literally like they literally can't play the game after that. Like the enemy
[3345.98s -> 3352.08s]  Team I'm in because like there's nothing they can do to stop it. We can totally fight this by the way
[3353.34s -> 3356.92s]  So like I've done that before we're like my thresh. Well, I know I have a good throw
[3356.92s -> 3358.92s]  Hold on. Let me let me win this teamfight really quick
[3360.36s -> 3383.82s]  Give me a sec
[3383.82s -> 3389.94s]  Okay, cool. Sorry. I had to win that teamfight real quick. Okay, so as I was saying, uh, there's a lot more to thresh then
[3391.26s -> 3393.26s]  People think right
[3393.26s -> 3397.20s]  It's essentially people over complicate like what he needs to do
[3397.20s -> 3400.76s]  So it's like Thresh is a very basic like when you see Thresh in pro play
[3400.88s -> 3404.62s]  You you don't ever see like what you do, but it's very rare that you see like the sick
[3405.32s -> 3410.36s]  Perma hooking like oh my god, like it's mainly like they pick him for like a lantern
[3411.48s -> 3412.66s]  straight up
[3412.66s -> 3414.60s]  Like when they when they pick Thresh in high elo
[3414.60s -> 3419.40s]  He's not picked to be the god tier like always landing perma CC hooks like flay god
[3419.40s -> 3422.36s]  like he's picked to like shut down engage and
[3423.68s -> 3425.52s]  remove
[3425.52s -> 3428.08s]  Kill threat to your carries. That's all he's picked for
[3430.74s -> 3432.74s]  But he's literally just an EW bot
[3434.97s -> 3440.01s]  Armor stacking. I mean, yeah, the armor thing on Thresh is nice, but it's I wouldn't say it's like OP on his kit
[3440.65s -> 3446.11s]  It just makes him like not die to 80 carries in two seconds
[3446.67s -> 3453.40s]  What what is happening?
[3453.40s -> 3457.96s]  But I instantly know I'm playing with a good Thresh player when I can walk up to the turret
[3461.70s -> 3463.70s]  When I can walk up to the turret and the threat
[3475.54s -> 3477.54s]  Sorry, I was trying to think and talk at the same time
[3477.54s -> 3481.18s]  When I can walk up to the turret, my Thresh player won't walk up and auto the turret with
[3481.18s -> 3482.18s]  me.
[3482.18s -> 3484.42s]  That's like the sign of a good Thresh player.
[3484.42s -> 3487.70s]  When we don't know where the enemy is, and instead of walking up and trying to hit the
[3487.70s -> 3491.94s]  turret to like help you kill the turret, they'll stand in the back and literally just sit there
[3491.94s -> 3499.30s]  and wait and hold lantern until, uh, they just hold their lantern until like you can,
[3499.30s -> 3504.93s]  until you get ganked, essentially.
[3504.93s -> 3508.29s]  And that's why, like I said, I just personally don't think Thresh's mechanics are as hard
[3508.29s -> 3509.77s]  as people think.
[3509.77s -> 3513.77s]  I do think he's very knowledge based, like I think Thresh has high knowledge caps
[3514.33s -> 3517.13s]  Where like, if you're playing, I don't know, like Lulu
[3517.53s -> 3522.01s]  Your skill is basically like, do I W? Your decision making on Lulu is literally
[3522.57s -> 3525.13s]  Do I W to speed or do I W to CC?
[3525.45s -> 3527.61s]  Right, like that's your decision making
[3527.97s -> 3530.09s]  So it's like obviously much higher than that
[3531.09s -> 3532.21s]  But it's uh...
[3534.69s -> 3535.73s]  You son of a bitch
[3536.53s -> 3538.45s]  But it's still not like that bad
[3538.45s -> 3543.43s]  I think Thresh just intimidates people because he can do so much
[3544.37s -> 3549.37s]  And so I think people just get intimidated but because they they think it looks overwhelming to learn the champ. I
[3553.84s -> 3560.64s]  Feel like that actually intimidates a lot of people in terms of like people not wanting to learn new champions and shits. I
[3561.76s -> 3563.76s]  feel like a lot of it is just
[3565.96s -> 3568.68s]  People are nervous about learning champions that look overwhelming
[3568.68s -> 3577.08s]  Like Aphelios for example, I was talking about this yesterday, Aphelios is not a hard mechanical
[3577.08s -> 3578.08s]  champion.
[3578.08s -> 3586.36s]  Like, he's difficult in terms of the knowledge required, like he's knowledge gated very hard.
[3586.36s -> 3592.32s]  So you have to play him a decent amount, or research him to understand what guns do what,
[3592.32s -> 3594.76s]  how to interact with the guns, stuff like that.
[3594.76s -> 3599.64s]  But the actual mechanics of using the guns, it's actually not hard.
[3599.64s -> 3614.05s]  Guys, what are we doing?
[3614.05s -> 3618.77s]  I guess we're just winning the fight.
[3618.77s -> 3619.77s]  Pike?
[3619.77s -> 3623.85s]  Like, like, I think Pike's harder than Thresh.
[3623.85s -> 3632.00s]  Maybe that's a hot take, but I think Pike is harder than Thresh.
[3632.00s -> 3637.34s]  Because Pike requires like really specific...
[3637.34s -> 3645.06s]  Pike is a lot harder to play than he looks when you see people play him.
[3645.06s -> 3650.58s]  there's like timers of when you can go in off of certain things like hitting his ulti consistently
[3650.58s -> 3656.42s]  in teamfights is a little harder than people think and knowing how to position in the lane
[3656.42s -> 3661.78s]  like Pyke is capable of a lot more than people think so i think Pyke's i think the reason the
[3661.78s -> 3670.29s]  main reason i think Pyke's a little harder is because he's melee like melee champions are always
[3670.29s -> 3675.49s]  going to be like mechanically more difficult than ranged if the melee champion is like
[3675.49s -> 3690.04s]  like you have to engage to go in and do stuff because there's always the counterplay factor
[3690.04s -> 3694.16s]  support role yeah that's what i'm saying it's like i'm not saying overall like overall ranged
[3694.16s -> 3698.16s]  champions require a lot more mechanics than melee just because you're ranged you can die
[3698.16s -> 3702.72s]  in a global and you have to space and stuff but i think that like in just the support
[3702.72s -> 3707.36s]  you support support specific i think melees are a lot harder to play that's why you see
[3707.36s -> 3712.28s]  a lot of like support players we give like the best support players in the world are
[3712.28s -> 3716.92s]  really good at like the engage melee supports not the like enchanters and that's why you see like
[3716.92s -> 3724.18s]  why we praise the best support players because like when you see somebody go in like perfectly
[3724.18s -> 3731.16s]  on Rakan or go in like find a way in without getting knocked up on like I don't know
[3732.52s -> 3736.44s]  something like when they find the angle on Thresh and shit it's really nice.
[3736.44s -> 3759.84s]  rel? i think rel sucks i think that champ is so bad because she just like she doesn't do anything
[3761.52s -> 3764.88s]  like rel's initial thing was like she was supposed to go in
[3766.08s -> 3770.96s]  be really tanky and then be like a stun bot for like team fights she was a team fight monster
[3770.96s -> 3776.88s]  but the problem with rel is like she has one chance essentially in lane phase like if anybody
[3776.88s -> 3782.08s]  has fingers on their hands and they can move left and right, Rell's really easy to dodge.
[3782.64s -> 3786.40s]  Like it's actually it's incredibly easy to beat a Rell in lane to not die to her.
[3787.12s -> 3791.92s]  Like you just have to move left and right, right? It's very simple. So it's like it's much more
[3791.92s -> 3799.36s]  difficult to dodge like other engaged champs, if that makes sense. Like Nautilus, you can still
[3799.36s -> 3803.68s]  move left and right, but it's like he can walk at you while it's happening. Whereas like if Rell
[3803.68s -> 3809.68s]  walks at you, I'm still like just waiting for the animation and then I can simply move to the left
[3810.48s -> 3816.64s]  because like her animation is so slow on using her ability that I can like dash, I can flash,
[3816.64s -> 3821.68s]  I can there's so much counterplay and it's like unless she flashes on you but it's even then you
[3821.68s -> 3827.92s]  can tell she's gonna flash on you so it's like I also feel like mid-game rel has this issue where
[3827.92s -> 3833.76s]  where she has her one trick ulti engage fight in teamfights, but after she does that, she
[3833.76s -> 3837.81s]  does literally nothing, right?
[3837.81s -> 3841.44s]  She's like a one and done.
[3841.44s -> 3851.12s]  That's why, like, she feels like she doesn't have other expression.
[3851.12s -> 3853.96s]  She's countered so hard by the meta too.
[3853.96s -> 3859.84s]  Melio counters Rell engage, Thresh counters Rell engage, right?
[3859.84s -> 3876.04s]  Like either, either of those champions shits on Rell engage and you can't do anything.
[3876.04s -> 3881.56s]  Like I don't know if you've ever tried to play Rell, gone in and been like thresh flayed,
[3881.56s -> 3884.46s]  but it's the worst feeling.
[3884.46s -> 3888.06s]  It's a bad feeling.
[3888.06s -> 3889.46s]  It's like when people play Leona.
[3889.46s -> 3892.02s]  It's the same reason Leona's shit right now.
[3892.02s -> 3896.38s]  Like they both have the same idea of why they're bad, right?
[3896.38s -> 3899.90s]  They like have, they're both good at doing what they're supposed to do.
[3899.90s -> 3902.80s]  Like you know, stun and create pressure and point click and shit.
[3902.80s -> 3909.68s]  But the problem is, you can easily counterpick them so incredibly hard that they just become
[3909.68s -> 3910.68s]  worthless the whole game.
[3910.68s -> 3916.29s]  Have you ever gotten Senna's secondary mission?
[3916.29s -> 3917.85s]  Oh, all the time.
[3917.85s -> 3921.95s]  With Senna being, like with Thresh being meta and Senna being a champion I'm playing a lot,
[3921.95s -> 3926.11s]  I get that all the time.
[3926.11s -> 3929.33s]  You don't even notice it though, I'm gonna be real.
[3929.33s -> 3932.05s]  When you kill the Thresh or whatever and you get his souls, you don't even fucking notice
[3932.05s -> 3938.41s]  it because it's like 40 armor.
[3938.41s -> 3941.05s]  And it's like you're level 17 or some shit at that point.
[3941.05s -> 3946.33s]  Like at the point you're getting it, you're such a high level that like the 40 random
[3946.33s -> 3949.01s]  armor like it's nice, but I never really notice it.
[3949.01s -> 3958.74s]  Planning to get your teammates ahead isn't that good?
[3958.74s -> 3962.68s]  You know what I've actually been doing as support on my main account?
[3962.68s -> 3977.97s]  I've actually been roaming nonstop and it's super OP because the key to roaming is all
[3977.97s -> 3984.45s]  you have to do to roam well is literally be there one or two times in the first five minutes of the
[3984.45s -> 3991.81s]  game to completely fuck over the enemy one time on an engage or something and they get so far
[3991.81s -> 4000.56s]  behind from it that you can literally just walk back bot like i do it on senna like i'll push bot
[4000.56s -> 4005.12s]  lane this is this is my strategy in senna i'm gonna give it to you guys okay so i don't know
[4005.12s -> 4009.12s]  i don't know if this works in low elo but in like masters like high masters this works at least
[4009.12s -> 4015.40s]  This is all I do on Senna. Every single player I play against on Senna, every single one
[4015.40s -> 4020.28s]  except for like Pyke players, even Nautilus, Blitz, they all concede lane level 1. Every
[4020.28s -> 4025.24s]  single one of them, right? They just let me push level 1. And so I'll push the waves in
[4025.24s -> 4031.92s]  level 1, and I'll either crash wave 2 or wave 3 depending on how far they're giving me like
[4031.92s -> 4039.32s]  push power right? So I will always crash wave 2 or wave 3 bot and I will immediately roam
[4039.32s -> 4049.28s]  mid. Every time. And even if I don't get a kill, usually it fucks over the enemy mid
[4049.28s -> 4061.02s]  laner so badly because on that exact timer, there's usually a gank happening on mid. So
[4061.02s -> 4065.34s]  A lot of the time, people think that you're roaming to get a kill for the laner.
[4065.34s -> 4066.34s]  You're not.
[4066.34s -> 4073.65s]  You're roaming to counter pressure from the other players in the game.
[4073.65s -> 4078.01s]  How many times have you guys been like, oh, we can win this 2v2, you see the enemy jungler,
[4078.01s -> 4080.69s]  your jungler comes, you're like, oh, we're going to bait this, and then all of a sudden
[4080.69s -> 4084.45s]  the support shows up, and you're like, god damn it, and then you die, and you're like,
[4084.45s -> 4086.05s]  what the fuck?
[4086.05s -> 4090.33s]  That right there is how easy it is to play support, because all you have to do is show
[4090.33s -> 4102.52s]  show up once, twice, and now that entire lane is fucked for the enemy team.
[4102.52s -> 4104.02s]  Roaming is so easy.
[4104.02s -> 4109.40s]  The only thing- people fuck up roaming really bad when they roam on timers where their AD
[4109.40s -> 4111.40s]  carry can't safely farm.
[4111.40s -> 4116.44s]  So what ends up happening is on that timer, right, where like I told you wave 2, 3, right?
[4116.44s -> 4119.68s]  What happens is you push that wave in, you roam mid.
[4119.68s -> 4121.08s]  Let's say nothing happens, okay?
[4121.08s -> 4123.74s]  I can just walk back bot.
[4123.74s -> 4125.20s]  You lose nothing.
[4125.20s -> 4127.88s]  And usually at that point, you have like 300 gold,
[4127.88s -> 4129.48s]  so there's no point in backing, right?
[4129.48s -> 4131.96s]  Now, let's say like, I notice that my jungler
[4131.96s -> 4134.28s]  is like invading top side.
[4134.28s -> 4136.30s]  I just walk over to top and help him.
[4137.56s -> 4140.36s]  Because you have like three to four,
[4140.36s -> 4142.00s]  you have like three to four waves
[4142.00s -> 4143.72s]  before the enemy bot lane,
[4143.72s -> 4150.80s]  the enemy bot lane has to play it almost perfectly
[4150.80s -> 4154.40s]  to be able to abuse your roam on certain timers.
[4155.90s -> 4157.32s]  They essentially have to play it perfect
[4157.32s -> 4158.22s]  to abuse the roam.
[4158.56s -> 4163.76s]  what i mean by that is like the way the best way to abuse uh support roaming is you either a
[4165.04s -> 4167.68s]  if you have the ability to dive you can pretty much a
[4169.76s -> 4174.40s]  immediately dive like push the next wave and then immediately dive if you like have that ability say
[4174.40s -> 4179.12s]  you're playing leona draven or something but even then it's a little risky because then the ad carry
[4179.12s -> 4184.00s]  can just walk back and they only lose one wave and you gave up you know a stack chance so it's
[4184.00s -> 4185.20s]  so it's not that bad.
[4185.20s -> 4188.48s]  Two, you can stack the wave.
[4188.48s -> 4191.72s]  Now, stacking the wave is the best way to counter it,
[4191.72s -> 4194.28s]  because let's say I'm roaming for an extended period,
[4194.28s -> 4196.02s]  you stack like a three wave,
[4196.02s -> 4197.36s]  and then all of a sudden you're crashing it,
[4197.36s -> 4199.12s]  and then you wanna, like you're up a level,
[4199.12s -> 4200.40s]  because you've been gaining XP,
[4200.40s -> 4202.32s]  and the AD carry has to back off.
[4202.32s -> 4203.80s]  But the way to counter that,
[4203.80s -> 4206.64s]  is you simply just walk back on the timer
[4206.64s -> 4208.48s]  of the stacked wave crashing as an AD carry,
[4208.48s -> 4209.72s]  or as a support.
[4209.72s -> 4211.76s]  It's so incredibly easy to do.
[4211.76s -> 4214.50s]  It's actually brainlessly easy to do.
[4214.50s -> 4219.28s]  Like, it's literally, you can roam all you want bot lane
[4219.28s -> 4222.94s]  as long as you are in bot lane for the stacked wave crashes
[4222.94s -> 4224.82s]  or you are in bot lane when your jungler
[4224.82s -> 4230.89s]  is bot side of the map.
[4230.89s -> 4234.13s]  It's easy as fuck.
[4234.13s -> 4236.99s]  But support players drool on themselves.
[4236.99s -> 4238.83s]  So they like to essentially,
[4240.27s -> 4243.51s]  support players like to like AFK in the lane phase.
[4243.51s -> 4246.41s]  They like to literally sit there and just do nothing.
[4247.65s -> 4255.04s]  That's like the average support I see is they will stand and do nothing.
[4255.04s -> 4258.16s]  And I've said this before, but I'll say it again, being a good support is not being a
[4258.16s -> 4260.00s]  better player in the enemy team.
[4260.00s -> 4264.28s]  Being a good support is queuing up to play League of Legends.
[4264.28s -> 4265.72s]  That's all it takes.
[4265.72s -> 4269.12s]  All it takes to be a good support is queuing up with the intent to push buttons in the
[4269.12s -> 4270.72s]  game.
[4270.72s -> 4271.72s]  And not just AFK.
[4271.72s -> 4499.24s]  Alright, I am back.
[4499.24s -> 4500.24s]  What's up?
[4500.24s -> 4501.24s]  I don't even remember what we were talking about.
[4501.24s -> 4502.24s]  Oh, supports.
[4502.24s -> 4503.24s]  Yeah, they're all stupid.
[4503.24s -> 4504.98s]  I don't even remember what we're talking about.
[4504.98s -> 4511.39s]  Oh, supports, yeah, they're all stupid.
[4511.39s -> 4513.39s]  Don't AFK on support, you'll gain LP.
[4513.39s -> 4515.39s]  It's that, it's actually that easy.
[4528.47s -> 4529.87s]  Honestly, I don't think supports are stupid.
[4529.87s -> 4532.95s]  I think it's more of a, how do I phrase this?
[4532.95s -> 4537.64s]  It's, in my opinion, it's more of like a,
[4537.64s -> 4545.33s]  they're like, they've never, they don't have to learn.
[4545.33s -> 4548.95s]  Support players don't have to learn important things
[4548.95s -> 4551.23s]  because they can get away with not doing it.
[4551.23s -> 4562.83s]  So they develop bad habits, that's all it is.
[4562.83s -> 4564.83s]  Do you have a Spotify playlist?
[4564.83s -> 4569.82s]  Yeah.
[4569.82s -> 4570.82s]  Best role to climb?
[4572.08s -> 4573.94s]  I think every role is good to climb,
[4573.94s -> 4575.36s]  as long as you're good.
[4575.36s -> 4576.20s]  Classic Jera.
[4576.20s -> 4577.66s]  Oh, I don't see.
[4577.66s -> 4578.50s]  Whatever you linked,
[4578.50s -> 4579.64s]  like, I don't know about links in the chat
[4579.64s -> 4582.04s]  because I had to turn them off a long time ago.
[4583.00s -> 4590.38s]  So I can't see it.
[4590.38s -> 4593.10s]  I would say though, climbing is just about like whatever,
[4593.10s -> 4594.70s]  because every role you can climb on, right?
[4594.70s -> 4596.00s]  Like every single role.
[4596.00s -> 4598.32s]  So climbing a lot of the time is just about
[4598.32s -> 4605.88s]  what you think is most fun for you
[4605.88s -> 4613.72s]  you can get the best at. I would say objectively the best roles to climb on are jungle and support
[4613.72s -> 4619.72s]  for just like higher elo well jungle and lower elo support and higher elo
[4621.32s -> 4626.04s]  I wouldn't climb on support in like gold because you're not gonna have a good time
[4626.04s -> 4632.68s]  trying to like help bad players play the game. Bad that's mean people who don't like you can
[4632.68s -> 4637.52s]  You can get like a gold Ezreal 30 kills by being the better support, but you won't always win
[4637.96s -> 4643.96s]  Whereas like if you really want to control solo queue and your teammates aren't like good enough to carry at that level
[4644.24s -> 4650.86s]  By themselves, right? Like you get frustrated just pick something that has more agency in the game
[4658.88s -> 4661.40s]  You lost 18 of 24 as jungle. You want to try a new role?
[4661.40s -> 4665.56s]  I mean you can play AD if you think it's AD carry is
[4666.56s -> 4668.64s]  Interesting. I wouldn't say it's like fun
[4668.64s -> 4683.24s]  fun, but it's not bad. You're in gold. I mean, you could try it. My view on it is that people
[4683.24s -> 4686.64s]  are wondering if they want to play a role or not. My view is just try it, see if you
[4686.64s -> 4689.18s]  like it. Cause if you don't like the role, you're not going to be able to put in enough
[4689.18s -> 4694.32s]  games to get good at the role. Right? So like, just give it a try, see if you enjoy it or
[4694.32s -> 4698.76s]  not. And if like, it's not fun, then if it's not your play style, it's not fun. Cause 80s
[4698.76s -> 4707.56s]  very unique playstyle from all the other roles. Like the reason people don't like playing ad carry
[4707.56s -> 4716.72s]  and like watching ad carry streamers and shit is because ad carry is like it's boring. ad carry is
[4716.72s -> 4723.15s]  like zero like like if there was a graph of shit going on when you're playing ad carry in the game
[4723.15s -> 4728.91s]  it's like this then it's like spikes to 100 and then it's back to like this right it's like
[4728.91s -> 4735.92s]  AD carry is a lot of, every game is different, right?
[4737.00s -> 4738.86s]  Every game when you play AD is different,
[4740.00s -> 4743.82s]  because you're always with a different player,
[4743.82s -> 4745.66s]  like a different support, unless you duo queue.
[4745.66s -> 4748.82s]  So every AD carry game's different, coupled with,
[4750.40s -> 4752.50s]  you spend a lot of the game just farming.
[4752.50s -> 4755.04s]  Like you don't get to interact with the enemy a lot.
[4755.04s -> 4757.02s]  So you just kind of farm a lot of the game.
[4757.02s -> 4759.12s]  And even then, you also like,
[4759.12s -> 4764.26s]  You basically are farming for like little dopamine hits of like team fights and stuff that you get around the game
[4764.26s -> 4771.04s]  So that's kind of fun, but it's like I said, it's all you you can climb on any roll
[4771.04s -> 4775.08s]  I think 80 carry requires the most mechanical skill to climb because
[4775.80s -> 4777.44s]  the difference between
[4777.44s -> 4780.84s]  The climbing is like a jungler is about being in the right spot at the right time
[4780.84s -> 4783.80s]  Right, like you need to path this way get objectives, etc
[4783.92s -> 4789.62s]  Climbing is an 80 carry is more about like this person fucked up their positioning. I'm gonna kill them type shit
[4789.62s -> 4825.70s]  We're constantly out of Q. Also, I want to say something. If you are playing, make sure,
[4825.70s -> 4830.50s]  and this is just a really good standardized bit of advice, make sure you're always tracking
[4830.50s -> 4838.14s]  what the enemy cooldowns are, what their spells are, stuff like that. Okay? Because playing
[4838.14s -> 4843.06s]  the game is not just about farming and your team goes in and you auto and shit. Like right
[4843.06s -> 4847.34s]  now, mid's Mia, right? I can see that Varus is Mia, but it is a Varus, so I'm not too
[4847.34s -> 4852.56s]  worried about being like level 2'd by Avaris, not that much, right? So I can kind of play
[4852.56s -> 4857.46s]  backward because I know that it's a high chance he's not going to Rumbata level 2 as Avaris.
[4857.46s -> 4862.38s]  Now if that was like a Fizz or some shit, I immediately back up. So we notice that it's
[4862.38s -> 4866.92s]  pretty obvious Rakan probably got W level 2, we don't know what it is, but he has Q,
[4866.92s -> 4877.53s]  so he doesn't have shield. Which means, because he doesn't have shield, it's hard for the
[4877.53s -> 4882.05s]  Rakan to get back out if he fucks up an engage. So you need to think about these type of things,
[4882.05s -> 4885.69s]  Right now this is wave 4 I believe and because it's wave 4
[4886.19s -> 4891.29s]  We're gonna get level 3 on wave 4 you always get level 3 on wave 4 if you have full XP
[4891.77s -> 4895.85s]  you get level 2 on wave 2 and
[4896.85s -> 4898.85s]  you get level 3 on wave 4 and
[4899.37s -> 4901.61s]  these timers for when you get
[4902.71s -> 4908.98s]  Certain level ups bot lane are very important now. I'm gonna hover over here
[4910.10s -> 4912.10s]  You see how fiddle is right here
[4913.06s -> 4915.70s]  I'm actually gonna just walk in here and see if I can like
[4917.06s -> 4919.06s]  Yeah, we see him nice
[4919.34s -> 4924.44s]  See, this is exactly what I was talking about before. Do you see what my support is doing? I
[4925.70s -> 4927.70s]  left the lane
[4927.98s -> 4934.56s]  Guys, I walked to like stand next to my jungler after we pushed the wave in my Lulu is
[4935.68s -> 4937.68s]  Hanging out by herself
[4937.68s -> 4958.77s]  self bot lane, but you should just chill it.
[4958.77s -> 4960.89s]  You don't want to do that.
[4960.89s -> 4963.29s]  You don't ever want to be the guy who's like
[4963.29s -> 4965.71s]  by yourself bot lane as a support.
[4966.93s -> 4970.53s]  Because you don't like supports don't need gold, right?
[4970.53s -> 4972.05s]  Not really.
[4972.05s -> 4973.13s]  And you don't need farm.
[4973.13s -> 4974.09s]  You don't need all that shit.
[4974.09s -> 4976.89s]  So if your AD carry roams and unless the wave is fucked
[4976.89s -> 4977.73s]  and they're just being stupid
[4977.73s -> 4979.37s]  and you have to fix the wave or something,
[4979.37s -> 4981.73s]  you don't want to be by yourself in the lane.
[4981.73s -> 4985.85s]  It just doesn't do anything.
[4985.85s -> 4986.97s]  How did I not auto a tower?
[4986.97s -> 4990.49s]  Oh, uh, I used, uh, Tilda.
[4990.49s -> 4992.77s]  So there's a way, there's actually a setting
[4992.77s -> 4995.77s]  you can have in the game where when you hit a button,
[4995.77s -> 4998.05s]  it makes it so that I can't physically hit
[4998.05s -> 4999.93s]  anything but a champion.
[4999.93s -> 5003.57s]  It's Target, it's called Target Champions Only,
[5003.57s -> 5004.45s]  and it's basically like, here,
[5004.45s -> 5005.49s]  I'll do it for you right now, watch.
[5005.49s -> 5007.33s]  You see how, like, I can hit the tower?
[5007.33s -> 5009.67s]  You see how it's the red sword?
[5011.53s -> 5013.01s]  So when I hit this button,
[5013.01s -> 5015.25s]  I can no longer hit the tower or the minions.
[5015.85s -> 5017.85s]  But I can still hit the champions
[5019.59s -> 5025.43s]  So essentially when you're fighting at a big minion wave or you're fighting under a turret you don't want to miss click
[5026.83s -> 5029.19s]  you just hit target champions only button and
[5030.03s -> 5037.14s]  It makes it a thousand times easier because you can literally only hit the champion. It's really nice
[5037.72s -> 5051.21s]  And you can make the button anything you want. Obviously, I just I use Tilda. It's the default
[5051.21s -> 5061.48s]  I actually want to kill these guys, but I need to wait for the wave to push out just a hair
[5062.90s -> 5066.74s]  The jungler could be bought but it is a fiddlesticks. So it's like I don't really care about a fiddlesticks being bought
[5067.30s -> 5081.37s]  We can straight up just kill them
[5081.37s -> 5083.37s]  Okay. Well, apparently we can't kill them
[5087.06s -> 5089.94s]  Because apparently my lulu didn't want to walk up
[5091.14s -> 5096.18s]  That's so frustrating man. I did fuck up my uh, my auto there, but
[5096.82s -> 5099.70s]  I am a little I I am kind of curious what happens
[5100.42s -> 5102.74s]  I'd have to go watch the vod. I fucked up my kill in the xayah
[5102.74s -> 5109.52s]  I think I walked left instead or down my movement was bad like essentially when they fought right I walked like this
[5109.52s -> 5111.52s]  I should have walked like this
[5111.78s -> 5115.12s]  Because you want to cut off the Zaya from the gank now
[5115.12s -> 5118.90s]  I do think when Lulu just blindly ran away. I think she kind of griefed
[5119.42s -> 5124.00s]  You don't need to insta run from ganks, especially when like you could see what I have right? I have Dirk and sheen
[5125.50s -> 5131.10s]  Something that a lot of people do as well is they will see that like the numbers are uneven and they'll instantly run away
[5131.10s -> 5135.02s]  They don't think about like how to win the fight or like what the the win con is of the fight
[5135.32s -> 5137.24s]  Because that's what I was saying before we got ganked right
[5137.24s -> 5141.94s]  I was like Fiddle can't gank us and he can't pre 6 Fiddle does nothing in the gank. I had cleanse
[5142.90s -> 5148.72s]  They don't actually beat us in 3v2. So the problem was is we weren't focusing the same target
[5148.72s -> 5151.16s]  I went for the Xayah and she backed really far up
[5151.60s -> 5154.02s]  Now if we had played forward a bit
[5154.38s -> 5158.44s]  Like say she played a little more forward with me that would have gone a lot better or if I had played a little more
[5158.44s -> 5165.42s]  back with her it was basically like we don't have comms so the you know it got rough now
[5165.42s -> 5171.74s]  fiddle is six now so it's a little scary i don't like playing versus fiddle sticks for like the
[5171.74s -> 5177.58s]  reason of like 90 of the time players don't know how to ward around fiddle people put wards in
[5177.58s -> 5193.72s]  weird spots we should have won that fight though i'm a little salty mainly myself so this too lulu
[5193.72s -> 5203.99s]  keeps speeding me up. Um, I want to be honest with you. I don't like when Lulu's do that.
[5203.99s -> 5208.71s]  It's like a pet peeve thing of mine when Lulu's use their speed. Like I'm okay with it if
[5208.71s -> 5212.51s]  I need to dodge something or I need to chase somebody, but I think it's just so much less
[5212.51s -> 5219.27s]  value than using it to CC early game. Early game, the CC of Lulu, like using W is so broken
[5219.27s -> 5224.75s]  to me because they just physically can't move their character for like 1.5 seconds, which
[5224.75s -> 5239.32s]  just crazy. I think Fiddle's bot. You can kind of tell. You see how they're playing
[5239.32s -> 5245.48s]  really aggressive? They don't beat us 2v2. So I'm thinking, and they just cleared this
[5245.48s -> 5253.46s]  ward out. I'm thinking Fiddle is either on dragon or he's bush ganking bot somewhere.
[5253.46s -> 5260.52s]  So I don't really want to walk up. You see how this guy is confidently hitting the turret?
[5260.52s -> 5269.90s]  This is making me think Fiddle's trying to lane gank. Because they cannot beat us 2v2.
[5269.90s -> 5274.76s]  I think Fiddle's in here. So I'm actually just gonna play safe
[5276.44s -> 5278.44s]  Until we see him on the map, I don't know
[5279.48s -> 5290.33s]  I'm not gonna take the chance because
[5291.93s -> 5296.71s]  You got to think about like what you see and what you don't see on the map like we can't physically see Fiddle, right?
[5296.89s -> 5300.57s]  But think about this. We don't see him top. That's something you have to think about
[5300.57s -> 5304.43s]  We we had a ward on Rift just now for 15 15 seconds, right?
[5305.33s -> 5307.33s]  We didn't see him top
[5307.33s -> 5314.40s]  So like if he's not top, where is he? Now? I think he finally left
[5315.16s -> 5331.42s]  This looks like he went to dragon. Yeah, what are we doing? By the way, I
[5332.58s -> 5334.46s]  Mean, I guess I'm just gonna die
[5334.46s -> 5337.96s]  Now would be the time to speed me. I
[5338.64s -> 5342.76s]  Mean, I don't even know what to say about that Malzahar just didn't walk
[5346.48s -> 5348.48s]  Gragas didn't flash his e
[5349.08s -> 5351.08s]  Malzahar didn't walk
[5351.08s -> 5364.08s]  You always walk there by the way. I want to make this clear. If you're a mid laner and you're playing a late game scaling mid, you always walk to the fight no matter what though. If it's doing that.
[5364.08s -> 5375.08s]  Okay, guys. We need to walk to fights. And Lulu, you need to follow up when I go in. Don't run.
[5375.08s -> 5383.75s]  run. I'm just gonna type it because I'm actually fucking annoying. I'm a little frustrated.
[5383.75s -> 5387.97s]  I still think the game is 100% winnable, but I'm playing Draven. We're playing like I'm
[5387.97s -> 5393.59s]  playing fucking Ezreal or some shit. And I can't walk up because essentially, we know
[5393.59s -> 5405.29s]  Fiddle was bot for the last two, three minutes, right? He just sat down there. What is my
[5405.29s -> 5414.32s]  Lulu doing? Bro, what are you doing? No, we fight this. Go. Yeah, this guy doesn't get
[5414.32s -> 5424.45s]  do this for free now they have a gale force so i need to be a little care this guy has no ulti
[5424.45s -> 5440.58s]  though like this is what i'm losing my mind man like dude just follow no what she was doing what
[5440.58s -> 5447.38s]  she was trying to protect her ward she saw the rakan hitting the ward but the xayah walked up
[5447.38s -> 5452.58s]  to get a free to just die the problem is my lulu was like oh i don't want to give up my ward and
[5452.58s -> 5458.50s]  And she wasn't thinking.
[5458.50s -> 5461.86s]  Please, uh, just sit with me, OK?
[5463.26s -> 5464.46s]  Caps, sorry.
[5465.34s -> 5468.24s]  I need you to follow me always.
[5469.80s -> 5471.80s]  Even if it looks scary,
[5472.60s -> 5474.54s]  you gotta follow, OK?
[5483.69s -> 5487.39s]  Also, uh, one thing is there's actually not a lot of fighting
[5487.39s -> 5489.79s]  that happens in lower elo.
[5489.79s -> 5492.99s]  So a lot of these players don't know how to fight early
[5492.99s -> 5498.67s]  Because one thing that I think has gotten really bad about League lately just in the past few years is
[5499.29s -> 5504.79s]  People don't ever limit test in League ever anymore. They always just play like pussies
[5505.43s -> 5507.93s]  Every single player in League plays like a fucking pussy nowadays
[5508.71s -> 5521.38s]  And it's literally just like sad to see like right there. Why aren't we W'ing?
[5521.94s -> 5524.58s]  Use W on the Xayah
[5526.26s -> 5530.81s]  Not to speed like
[5531.89s -> 5536.53s]  I'm losing my mind because all you have to do there is W the Xayah, she gets CC'd, we kill her in the W.
[5538.13s -> 5545.17s]  I'm telling you, Lulu players are like hard-wired for some reason to not play correctly.
[5561.82s -> 5564.54s]  I'm never gonna catch this guy, he's got Galeforce and tier 2 boots.
[5570.77s -> 5574.21s]  Yeah, I mean I have to go for it though because if I don't go for kills now the game's over.
[5574.77s -> 5578.61s]  So it's either we go for it or we lose, so I'm willing to like look stupid.
[5578.61s -> 5587.32s]  Honestly, this game was my fault for the 1 2v3 that happened early. I misplayed it. And
[5587.32s -> 5591.68s]  if I didn't misplay that, we would have won the game off it. Now the game's pretty much
[5591.68s -> 5597.80s]  over. Like it's solo queue, so we can always come back. But the problem is, uh, I don't
[5597.80s -> 5603.52s]  think we have good enough players to come back. Like, look at what Lulu's doing. Lulu,
[5603.52s -> 5606.34s]  Why are you bot solo at the moment?
[5606.34s -> 5609.37s]  Think.
[5609.37s -> 5610.21s]  Like what?
[5610.21s -> 5611.05s]  He's, ah!
[5612.49s -> 5622.08s]  What are we doing?
[5622.08s -> 5624.16s]  This is exactly what I was telling you guys.
[5624.16s -> 5625.68s]  Doesn't make sense.
[5625.68s -> 5627.14s]  Remember when I told you support's easy?
[5627.14s -> 5630.06s]  All you have to do is be a human?
[5630.06s -> 5631.60s]  Remember when I said that 40 sec,
[5631.60s -> 5636.22s]  or four minutes ago before the game started?
[5636.22s -> 5638.18s]  All you have to do to play support is think,
[5638.18s -> 5640.52s]  push buttons, and be active in the game.
[5640.52s -> 5641.60s]  And if you can do those things,
[5641.60s -> 5646.75s]  you'll get Challenger on support.
[5646.75s -> 5649.03s]  Like, it blows my mind.
[5649.03s -> 5650.23s]  Like, look at what she's doing.
[5650.23s -> 5671.49s]  What are you doing?
[5671.49s -> 5672.87s]  This is a forfeit though.
[5672.87s -> 5676.53s]  I'm gonna lose my minds.
[5676.53s -> 5682.97s]  Auto-filled AD.
[5682.97s -> 5691.56s]  I'm gonna lose it.
[5691.56s -> 5692.46s]  My bad, guys.
[5692.46s -> 5693.30s]  I'm an auto-filled AD.
[5693.30s -> 5694.14s]  I'm just bad.
[5694.14s -> 5694.96s]  It's on me.
[5694.96s -> 5704.42s]  I apologize.
[5704.42s -> 5710.21s]  Oh man, these players are crazy.
[5710.21s -> 5715.62s]  I'm actually really surprised we're just not forfeiting now.
[5715.62s -> 5717.14s]  The best way to play the game
[5717.14s -> 5719.06s]  is something that like I fall victim to too,
[5719.06s -> 5721.10s]  where I fuck this up sometimes, right?
[5721.10s -> 5723.78s]  But the best way to play the game a lot of the time is,
[5723.78s -> 5726.48s]  you essentially don't play to take risks.
[5728.30s -> 5729.98s]  I know it sounds silly,
[5729.98s -> 5730.98s]  cause you gotta find,
[5730.98s -> 5732.58s]  essentially you have to find the,
[5737.96s -> 5740.36s]  my Malzahar just let this guy,
[5740.36s -> 5743.20s]  this 1000 gold walk away.
[5743.20s -> 5746.64s]  Hey Malz, if you move by the way,
[5746.64s -> 5756.14s]  you get 1k gold.
[5756.14s -> 5759.44s]  Mid isn't hard role.
[5759.44s -> 5765.40s]  I can mid in my sleep.
[5765.40s -> 5766.96s]  It's not.
[5766.96s -> 5775.90s]  AD is easiest role.
[5775.90s -> 5778.38s]  I'm AD carry streamer.
[5778.38s -> 5789.36s]  I play AD, but Lulu is small brain.
[5789.44s -> 5790.52s]  That was mean.
[5790.52s -> 5792.60s]  Lulu took some crossfire there
[5792.60s -> 5793.52s]  that she didn't need to take.
[5793.52s -> 5796.66s]  That was my bad.
[5796.66s -> 5815.70s]  That was toxic.
[5815.70s -> 5816.52s]  I'll be real.
[5816.52s -> 5819.22s]  I think today's gonna be a mute all kind of day.
[5819.22s -> 5822.78s]  Listening to low elo players talk about the game,
[5822.78s -> 5824.58s]  and then they think that they're right about the game
[5824.58s -> 5826.18s]  and like how it works and all this shit,
[5826.18s -> 5827.56s]  it actually like hurts me.
[5827.56s -> 5828.94s]  Like it shouldn't.
[5828.94s -> 5831.20s]  I should just laugh it off, but sometimes,
[5831.20s -> 5832.78s]  when I see a low elo player talk about
[5832.78s -> 5834.52s]  how they think the game should be played,
[5834.52s -> 5836.44s]  and I just know that they're wrong,
[5836.44s -> 5841.99s]  it actually physically hurts me.
[5841.99s -> 5853.60s]  It does, it physically hurts.
[5853.60s -> 5855.50s]  But, I should follow my own rule,
[5855.50s -> 5859.16s]  where if you're playing with people that aren't as good,
[5859.16s -> 5860.56s]  they don't see what you see.
[5861.40s -> 5865.08s]  There's something where it's better to play safe in scale,
[5865.08s -> 5867.64s]  even on Draven, it's better to play safe in scale
[5867.64s -> 5869.68s]  than to go for plays in lane.
[5871.10s -> 5880.62s]  Mainly because if you go for plays in lane and let's say your support is not as good
[5880.62s -> 5884.84s]  as you, or your support is not confident in their ability to 2v2, right?
[5884.84s -> 5886.06s]  Then you're just going to lose.
[5886.06s -> 5889.86s]  So you're like forcing that person to be in an uncomfortable situation.
[5889.86s -> 5896.10s]  So like, it's hard for me as a player to just play safe when I see the enemy making mistake
[5896.10s -> 5897.10s]  after mistake.
[5897.10s -> 5902.14s]  It's like something that I have trouble like personally working on right just like a personal issue
[5902.78s -> 5907.02s]  Where like i'll see an enemy make a mistake positional wise i'm like, oh shit. Let's abuse this
[5907.58s -> 5909.58s]  but a lot of the time the problem that happens is
[5910.62s -> 5914.62s]  You have somebody who doesn't know that that person made a mistake or doesn't see the same mistake as me
[5915.02s -> 5918.22s]  And because there's no comms I can't relate to them that we should fight right?
[5918.62s -> 5923.66s]  So if I go in and they don't know that we should be fighting there. I I end up dying and it looks it feels
[5924.22s -> 5927.58s]  really bad
[5927.58s -> 5931.26s]  Which is, I mean, my fault. It's like a personal thing.
[5931.26s -> 5934.58s]  Because you can't control your supports, you can only control yourself.
[5934.58s -> 5937.78s]  It's just something that like, I suck at doing sometimes.
[5939.52s -> 5940.02s]  Right?
[5940.02s -> 5943.07s]  So that's just on me.
[5943.07s -> 5965.98s]  We could actually kill the Zire right now, by the way.
[5965.98s -> 5968.38s]  She's like, 60% HP.
[5968.38s -> 5970.28s]  Like, we could kill her.
[5970.28s -> 5995.65s]  What is my Gragas doing?
[5997.55s -> 5998.65s]  Oh, he got her though, nice.
[5998.65s -> 6005.44s]  Bro.
[6005.44s -> 6007.04s]  Use W.
[6007.04s -> 6011.60s]  To CC people.
[6011.60s -> 6012.60s]  Not to speed people.
[6012.60s -> 6020.16s]  That was a good example too.
[6020.16s -> 6027.14s]  Oh well.
[6027.14s -> 6029.62s]  I just gotta get better at doing that where I play safe though.
[6029.62s -> 6030.62s]  That's on me.
[6030.62s -> 6059.82s]  That's just a personal thing I gotta get better at.
[6059.82s -> 6060.82s]  Oh man.
[6060.82s -> 6061.82s]  I think we're warmed up though.
[6061.82s -> 6065.02s]  What ad carry do you guys want to see next game?
[6065.02s -> 6066.82s]  That was a brutal ass game.
[6066.82s -> 6071.54s]  I'm gonna be real, that was a brutal ass game.
[6071.54s -> 6072.90s]  What ad carry streamer do you guys want to see?
[6072.90s -> 6073.90s]  Or ad carry stream.
[6073.90s -> 6084.12s]  80 carry champion do you guys want to see this game i just goofed up and tried to play too
[6084.12s -> 6089.48s]  aggressive with a player that wasn't willing to play aggressive that was on me that's my bad
[6091.66s -> 6111.37s]  i'll i'll uh i'll play better this guy this guy goes scion
[6118.20s -> 6121.56s]  oh never change twitch chat never change
[6140.95s -> 6144.39s]  well the thing is is you have i have to change my mindset so like the thing
[6144.39s -> 6146.71s]  Okay, let me explain something. It's like a personal thing with me
[6147.51s -> 6152.31s]  I'm, very very very good mechanically at this game, right? Like it's my best trait. It's like I have very good mechanics
[6153.43s -> 6155.99s]  So and I also have like an autistic weird brain
[6157.03s -> 6158.23s]  where
[6158.23s -> 6159.83s]  I can see
[6159.83s -> 6161.83s]  I I have really good pattern recognition
[6162.23s -> 6168.47s]  So when I see that the enemy is fucking up, I know that i'm pretty much always going to be better at the 2v2
[6169.43s -> 6170.63s]  Okay
[6170.63s -> 6172.31s]  so
[6172.31s -> 6178.31s]  Because I know that I'm always going to be better at the 2v2, I always want to take the fight
[6179.83s -> 6184.87s]  when I see that they make a mistake, like they miss a skill shot or they walk up too far,
[6184.87s -> 6189.43s]  stuff like that, right? But the problem is, when you're bot lane, you have to work with a teammate
[6190.07s -> 6194.47s]  and that's part of just playing AD carry, right? And if you're in solo queue, you can't always duo.
[6194.47s -> 6197.83s]  So you have to I I have to like train myself
[6199.19s -> 6204.07s]  To just be okay with them making mistakes and us not abusing those mistakes
[6205.19s -> 6207.69s]  It's very frustrating for me personally because i'm a perfectionist
[6208.31s -> 6212.39s]  So it's very frustrating for me to like see this happening and i'm like, oh I want to abuse this because I know we can
[6212.79s -> 6214.79s]  but we have to like I have to like
[6215.11s -> 6219.27s]  Tell myself not to and to just like not fuck up the wave state not take bad trades and shit
[6219.67s -> 6221.83s]  Because every time there's there's more to it, too
[6221.83s -> 6223.87s]  So if like I walk up and I take a fight, right?
[6223.87s -> 6226.95s]  Let's say like when Rakan W'd in when the Fiddle ganked for example, right?
[6228.31s -> 6234.27s]  If I take that fight, I'm now banking that fight on Lulu also playing correctly, right?
[6234.27s -> 6239.71s]  Like they they missed all their abilities and they fucked up, but I also messed like
[6241.55s -> 6246.99s]  You nobody can play perfectly every game like I can't teammates can't nobody can it's League and we're all humans, right?
[6246.99s -> 6252.87s]  So you have to bank when you're doing that on like your teammate being able to know what you want to accomplish in that moment
[6252.87s -> 6258.91s]  In solo queue with no comms and it's really hard like it's it's a really bad mindset that I have sometimes
[6259.91s -> 6261.99s]  but it's hard to get over because like I
[6263.31s -> 6266.73s]  Like the landing phase for me is the most fun part of the game
[6266.73s -> 6274.45s]  I love landing face because in my opinion landing phase is like a little mini chess game between the enemy ball in right
[6275.49s -> 6278.09s]  It's like a it's like a chess game with like mechanics
[6278.69s -> 6282.85s]  where it's like, how well can I auto-space them, right?
[6282.85s -> 6284.65s]  Can I space them well?
[6284.65s -> 6287.05s]  Can I space them, by spacing I mean,
[6287.05s -> 6290.73s]  can I walk into them, trade, and not take damage back, right?
[6290.73s -> 6291.57s]  And I'm always thinking to myself,
[6291.57s -> 6292.65s]  like, okay, can I do that?
[6292.65s -> 6293.49s]  I can.
[6293.49s -> 6295.17s]  And then I'm like, I wanna do this, right?
[6295.17s -> 6296.77s]  And then I'll get somebody to half,
[6296.77s -> 6299.37s]  and then they'll panic and they'll engage on me.
[6299.37s -> 6301.65s]  And the problem is, though, is, like I said,
[6301.65s -> 6305.13s]  without comms, or without people who are recognizing
[6305.13s -> 6306.97s]  what you're trying to accomplish,
[6306.97s -> 6313.53s]  Sometimes, supports and junglers, people get flustered and it will go badly.
[6313.53s -> 6317.57s]  And it's my fault at the end of the day because I'm choosing that playstyle of relying on
[6317.57s -> 6322.49s]  my teammates instead of knowing that I can probably outscale and play better late game
[6322.49s -> 6325.25s]  and just keep good CS and not die and shit.
[6325.25s -> 6328.13s]  Which is what you guys should all do.
[6328.13s -> 6330.93s]  And that's what I tell people to do when they ask me how to play AD.
[6330.93s -> 6334.53s]  I tell you, don't die, scale up, get items.
[6334.53s -> 6338.13s]  like because i've played the game for so long and my favorite part of the game is
[6340.13s -> 6344.69s]  lane phase and like winning lane and playing that little chess game i fuck myself over in a lot of
[6344.69s -> 6350.93s]  games because i'll like you know force fights that like my teammate would have to play well in as
[6350.93s -> 6355.17s]  well to win and uh i'll make a mistake or they'll make a mistake and we'll just lose the game off
[6355.17s -> 6363.25s]  it and it's not a good play style right it's not a good play style but that's just like something
[6363.25s -> 6368.77s]  that like I know other people probably also have and I'm telling you that like if you want to climb
[6368.77s -> 6376.75s]  you got to get out of that mindset and get into the mindset of like consistency because you can
[6376.75s -> 6384.99s]  see last game for example uh I just straight up like lost the game off of me trying to fight when
[6384.99s -> 6392.37s]  my support didn't know how to fight or want to fight and we lost the game off it like I was too
[6392.37s -> 6398.05s]  aggro and even though if they did play correctly we win they didn't so we lost so it's basically
[6398.05s -> 6405.57s]  like it's just not like a good uh it's not a good uh what's the word i'm looking for strategy
[6412.26s -> 6418.42s]  because last game was my fault because i'm good enough at the game that i know that i can't play
[6418.42s -> 6427.58s]  like that if i want to be consistent and i still played like it so it's my bad all right what are
[6427.58s -> 6430.94s]  What are we playing this game boys? We got Rengar, Karma, Jhin
[6431.90s -> 6435.58s]  What do people want to see? Let me see if any of the AD carries people want to see if I can play these
[6437.18s -> 6441.82s]  I can't play Vayne into this, Vayne would be way too hard into Karma Jhin. I would just get zoned off the wave
[6441.82s -> 6451.92s]  I could play Aphelios
[6453.08s -> 6460.44s]  This is actually a good Aphelios game. You know what kind of sucks?
[6460.44s -> 6467.48s]  I feel kind of bad playing Aphelios when I'm on my like teaching accounts like this account to like teach you guys
[6467.48s -> 6472.30s]  Because I feel bad playing Aphelios sometimes.
[6472.30s -> 6477.48s]  Because I know a lot of people don't want to learn Aphelios or play Aphelios.
[6477.48s -> 6480.84s]  Because he is like really...
[6480.84s -> 6484.16s]  He's very unique.
[6484.16s -> 6486.62s]  He's hard to learn for a lot of people.
[6486.62s -> 6489.00s]  So I always feel kind of bad doing it.
[6489.00s -> 6490.00s]  Right?
[6490.00s -> 6493.36s]  But I'll be real, I don't know...
[6493.36s -> 6500.36s]  In this specific situation, outside of Jinx, I didn't really know what else to pick.
[6500.36s -> 6512.26s]  Like Jinx is good, Kai'sa is probably okay, but you still get zoned off the wave on Kai'sa.
[6512.26s -> 6520.93s]  Because if we look at this, Kai'sa would have been, I guess, okay.
[6520.93s -> 6527.51s]  But when you're picking a champion for bot lane, one thing that you guys should think
[6527.51s -> 6531.07s]  about when picking what champion you want to play, unless you're a one trick and then
[6531.07s -> 6534.71s]  play whatever you want but if you're like somebody who wants to actually like play the
[6534.71s -> 6543.88s]  meta and learn why champions are meta and when to pick what they picked jhin karma now
[6543.88s -> 6550.36s]  we have a lulu if we had something with a hook like a nautilus a blitz a thresh a pike
[6550.36s -> 6555.00s]  like if we had something like that i could pick a low range fighter right like i could
[6555.00s -> 6559.48s]  pick a low range fighter if we had a hook champ but because we don't have a hook champ
[6559.48s -> 6565.56s]  and we have an enchanter, I have to pick something that can safely consistently farm and not get
[6565.56s -> 6571.00s]  zoned off by their bot lane. So there's not a lot of options that can do that. There's like,
[6571.64s -> 6575.00s]  I didn't want to pick, you could pick Ezreal here, it's not the worst, but we had a Lulu,
[6575.00s -> 6579.08s]  so I didn't want to pick Ezreal because Lulu goes to waste. So it's like you could pick Jinx,
[6579.08s -> 6582.44s]  but I kind of didn't want to pick Jinx this game because Jinx bores the shit out of me right now.
[6583.32s -> 6588.04s]  So this would be a good Jinx game though, if you guys are curious, like this would be a completely
[6588.04s -> 6595.76s]  fine jinx game your e stops rengar jump uh you can follow up really easily with lulu like this
[6595.76s -> 6602.56s]  would be a good jinx game um but aphelios it's a good aphelios game too it's both it's good
[6602.56s -> 6608.48s]  aphelios game good jinx game um it could be a good zary game zary wouldn't be that bad here
[6609.04s -> 6614.00s]  with lulu and against their comp uh they're all really squishy she's really mobile can get away
[6614.00s -> 6621.92s]  from like rengar ganks pretty easily tristana i okay so trist is unique because you only pick
[6621.92s -> 6630.16s]  tristana if you plan on winning lane okay tristana doesn't actually scale better than jinx in any way
[6631.92s -> 6637.04s]  like she does not have a better scaling than jinx trist trist versus jinx three items
[6637.04s -> 6642.88s]  jinx wins every time in team fights no matter what like you she just does what trist does better
[6642.88s -> 6648.46s]  Now, the reason you pick Trist is because you do want to win lane, you want to like
[6648.46s -> 6651.02s]  jump in, you want to kill them, you want to be aggressive, right?
[6651.02s -> 6654.26s]  So that's what you're picking Trist for, is to get kills in lane.
[6654.26s -> 6656.94s]  The problem is, is again, what we were just talking about, right?
[6656.94s -> 6659.18s]  Let's say I pick Trist to get kills in lane.
[6659.18s -> 6664.58s]  Now let's say my support doesn't want to be aggressive, and let's say like the Jhin and
[6664.58s -> 6667.90s]  the Karma have a really good push, okay?
[6667.90s -> 6671.66s]  Something that Trist is really weak at is being pushed in, right?
[6671.66s -> 6675.86s]  one of her weakest things because she struggles, especially early game, she struggles quite
[6675.86s -> 6682.94s]  a bit on farming under turret. So let's say, it's just like a coin flippy pick. You could
[6682.94s -> 6689.94s]  pick Trist if you had like a support duo for sure into Jhin. Trist is amazing into Jhin.
[6689.94s -> 6694.50s]  It's one of Jhin's hardest actual counters. But again, it's not about countering the champion,
[6694.50s -> 6698.02s]  it's about countering the lane and what the lane is going to do to you and being able
[6698.02s -> 6703.62s]  play around that. And this lane is a shove lane. Jhin and Karma doesn't fight you, they poke you
[6703.62s -> 6707.86s]  and shove waves in. That's what they do, they're a prio lane. So they're just gonna shove and shove
[6707.86s -> 6712.02s]  and shove, right? So because they're just gonna shove and shove and shove, I need to play something
[6712.02s -> 6715.94s]  that isn't gonna have issues playing under turret or something that can shove back if I need to.
[6717.30s -> 6725.76s]  Right? Which is why Jinx Aphelios are both good. Ezreal again would just get shoved in,
[6725.76s -> 6728.56s]  stuff like that, right? These are things you actually have to think about when you're playing
[6728.56s -> 6736.32s]  the game for certain champions in certain matchups because a lot of the time people will pick a
[6736.32s -> 6740.40s]  champion that's meta and they won't understand why they're still losing the matchup even though
[6740.40s -> 6745.20s]  they're good at that champion and it's just that you're not bad at the champ the matchup is just
[6745.20s -> 6751.68s]  unplayable you could put faker doublelift fucking gumiasi in certain matchups and they will just
[6751.68s -> 6757.28s]  lose they will lose the matchups and it's because no matter how good your mechanics are if the matchup
[6757.28s -> 6763.46s]  is played correctly it doesn't it's not winnable and that's why you see in pro play drafting is so
[6763.46s -> 6767.78s]  important it's perfect example of why in pro play drafting is 10 times more important than solo queue
[6767.78s -> 6773.55s]  and it's because when everybody plays the matchups correctly and shit right when everybody's playing
[6773.55s -> 6779.23s]  the matchups correctly and shits the matchup like skill becomes a thousand times more important
[6780.67s -> 6785.15s]  or like you know how the matchups being played like the champions become way more important
[6785.15s -> 6790.43s]  whoa what the fuck my monitor just fucked up what the hell is going on
[6790.43s -> 6798.31s]  another little tip for you guys oh I fucked that up but another little tip for
[6798.31s -> 6812.22s]  you guys is melee champions or melee minions take one turret shot two autos
[6812.22s -> 6818.91s]  or sorry two turret shots one auto and casters take one auto one turret shot
[6818.91s -> 6824.67s]  when you're under turrets like luck okay so learning this would be actually a
[6824.67s -> 6828.11s]  pretty good game to explain to you how to farm under the turret actually. I was thinking about
[6828.11s -> 6830.83s]  like what I could teach you guys because we're just gonna get shoved in a lot this game.
[6832.67s -> 6842.66s]  It's actually not that bad though. So right now we could actually space forward here.
[6844.02s -> 6859.07s]  Okay that did not hit me that was bs but sure. I did the same thing I did last game man.
[6860.83s -> 6868.35s]  I did the same thing. You see I walked up. It wasn't it was a good fight but again I keep doing
[6868.35s -> 6872.19s]  Or like I see the fight and I'll take the fight because I know it's a good fight
[6873.03s -> 6879.04s]  But Lulu was too far back. So I ended up just inting. It's really stupid
[6881.49s -> 6899.54s]  like it was such a dumb play by me because I had to blow both my sums right there because
[6900.98s -> 6905.44s]  The Jhin or I mean the Jhin was in a really bad spot and the Karma was in a really bad spot because I was level
[6905.44s -> 6908.02s]  3 and they were level 2 and they were walking up to contest waves
[6908.86s -> 6909.90s]  but
[6909.90s -> 6915.82s]  My Lulu was behind me and when you're playing, you know solo queue you have to play as a team
[6915.86s -> 6927.42s]  with your teammate okay so this jinn is kind of griefing right now he's griefing by like walking
[6927.42s -> 6937.42s]  up when i'm blue gunning him i don't know what lulu's doing oh she's killing that guy nice yeah
[6937.42s -> 6940.70s]  they're they're grieving really hard so the blue gun is op for what you just saw
[6941.58s -> 6944.70s]  all you have to do with the blue gun if you really want to just like have a funny ass
[6944.70s -> 6958.19s]  overpowered fucking when they're farming under the turret like that just hit the minions okay
[6958.19s -> 6960.19s]  Okay, we're getting ganked.
[6960.19s -> 6961.75s]  Let's back up.
[6961.75s -> 6970.84s]  So I kind of did a cardinal sin there, I would say. Like a sin of like...
[6971.70s -> 6973.70s]  I overstayed a bit, I think.
[6975.56s -> 6977.56s]  Okay, well fuck off, dude.
[6978.62s -> 6982.36s]  That was greedy. I should have backed out the turret, but I didn't think Karma was actually gonna do that.
[6982.36s -> 6986.26s]  But, uh, I did overstay because you can see like this is the perfect example of why I overstayed.
[6986.36s -> 6988.36s]  So they stopped to my back, right?
[6988.92s -> 6991.54s]  I can give you guys a really good example of what just happened.
[6991.54s -> 6996.34s]  I overstayed and when I overstayed I didn't actually get anything out of it
[6996.34s -> 6999.64s]  Like I got what you saw I just have extra gold for nothing
[6999.76s -> 7006.02s]  So now I just have extra gold right and because I have extra gold the Jhin actually gets a net positive because they stopped my back
[7006.16s -> 7010.30s]  So he gets a free plate here. I miss a cannon and even though I'm still up 10 CS
[7010.80s -> 7018.28s]  It's like I could have been up 10 CS not given a plate and not missed a cannon. So it's it's basically like
[7018.28s -> 7023.16s]  Like, it's interesting.
[7023.16s -> 7025.16s]  Should you get prio for your jungler every game?
[7025.16s -> 7026.16s]  No.
[7026.16s -> 7029.94s]  No, that's not important.
[7029.94s -> 7031.78s]  Some games, prio is important.
[7031.78s -> 7034.10s]  It's very important in some games.
[7034.10s -> 7038.08s]  But you don't need to always be thinking about getting prio for your jungler.
[7038.08s -> 7040.42s]  That's not something you should be like thinking about like always, right?
[7040.42s -> 7043.64s]  Like you think about it in terms of like timers.
[7043.64s -> 7049.46s]  That's important, but prio for jungler always is not like something you should be worrying
[7049.46s -> 7054.92s]  about.
[7054.92s -> 7058.36s]  if you're perma shoving and you're like oh i have prio for my jungler but then your jungler
[7058.36s -> 7063.08s]  doesn't do anything like having that prio if you don't have prio it doesn't do anything
[7065.29s -> 7102.60s]  like i'd rather hold the wave in like a certain spot oh my god i suck i mean it worked out
[7103.40s -> 7112.12s]  i think if i was six i triple kill them there but i think we actually almost i think we actually
[7112.12s -> 7116.36s]  triple kill them too if lulu helped me but again you guys know what i'm gonna say i go back to
[7116.36s -> 7168.55s]  in a thing. I don't know if Rengar has ulti or not. I want to shove this because, uh,
[7168.55s -> 7186.11s]  chill. I want to shove it in for a second, and I really don't have anything to do, so
[7186.11s -> 7191.87s]  I'll just stand here. You want to also be backed once it's hit for when to buy boots.
[7191.87s -> 7195.55s]  I bought boots. Aphelios, you can buy boots really early. He's, like, he's a champion
[7195.55s -> 7200.11s]  where the more attacks you do is actually very valuable, and positioning on Aphelios
[7200.11s -> 7205.31s]  is very important. It's kind of like, um, some AD carries, like you don't need boots
[7205.31s -> 7209.95s]  really early. Like, like with like Jinx, for example, I usually go free boots, right? Or
[7209.95s -> 7217.19s]  I go boots like after my Kraken, but with Aphelios, uh, I really liked the early mobility,
[7217.19s -> 7227.11s]  the early trading stuff like that. Ooh, okay. So always be watching the map too. We see
[7227.11s -> 7233.55s]  the Rengar's top, right? We can actually just straight fight these guys 2v2 right now. Uh,
[7233.55s -> 7242.87s]  Wait, what? What's my Lulu doing? Homie?
[7242.87s -> 7246.07s]  What? What are we... He's ulting us!
[7246.07s -> 7261.15s]  So you're saying, helping the AD carry is bad.
[7261.15s -> 7268.74s]  Got it.
[7268.74s -> 7271.50s]  I can't believe my Lulu just walked away from me
[7271.50s -> 7275.88s]  and just like watched... Like, you work as a team.
[7275.88s -> 7279.58s]  This is something that I cannot stress enough.
[7279.58s -> 7286.29s]  Play as a team when you play League of Legends.
[7286.29s -> 7291.05s]  This tilts me more than anything, because this happens even in Grandmaster.
[7291.05s -> 7295.89s]  I see teammates who will be selfish and not help each other.
[7295.89s -> 7298.41s]  Just help each other.
[7298.41s -> 7299.41s]  Help each other.
[7299.41s -> 7300.41s]  Please, man.
[7300.41s -> 7304.17s]  We are a team.
[7304.17s -> 7307.09s]  Don't just run and leave your ADC.
[7307.09s -> 7313.83s]  Like, I'm not even flaming you, but, like, dude, you can't do that.
[7313.83s -> 7319.23s]  You can't be upset that, like, I can't dodge every spell, right?
[7319.23s -> 7323.79s]  I feel like something that I noticed that happens a lot in League nowadays, is players
[7323.79s -> 7328.79s]  will have this weirdly high expectation for everyone to play absolutely perfect at all
[7328.79s -> 7334.03s]  times, and they want me to like, be Gumiasi.
[7334.03s -> 7341.23s]  And I'm like, dude, I dodged two of the Jhin bullets, I dodged a Karma Q, like, you literally,
[7341.23s -> 7343.51s]  I can't dodge literally everything while slowed, right?
[7343.51s -> 7353.16s]  Like that's not how it works.
[7353.16s -> 7385.33s]  Like dude, I'm gonna lose my mind with this guy.
[7385.33s -> 7395.30s]  My Lulu is blaming me, it's okay.
[7395.30s -> 7399.40s]  It's okay, I don't need to be upset, it's fine.
[7400.46s -> 7409.00s]  The Lulu player is totally okay.
[7409.00s -> 7411.48s]  You know, sometimes people think they're right.
[7412.36s -> 7423.99s]  It's just what happens in the worlds, right?
[7424.59s -> 7442.24s]  It's just, it is what it is, no big deal.
[7442.24s -> 7445.84s]  Sorry, I'm trying really hard to not be an asshole right now.
[7445.84s -> 7448.58s]  This Lulu player is making me like,
[7448.58s -> 7450.40s]  making me wanna like fund Thanos.
[7450.40s -> 7451.24s]  You know what I mean?
[7451.24s -> 7452.54s]  Like this guy is like making me,
[7453.60s -> 7455.66s]  like this guy, like we talk about,
[7457.00s -> 7460.16s]  in League, we talk about like the players,
[7460.16s -> 7463.20s]  like we talk about AD carry players having ego.
[7463.20s -> 7468.14s]  I genuinely think support players have five times the ego
[7468.14s -> 7471.70s]  AD carry players have, but with like a third of the skill.
[7475.48s -> 7483.44s]  I think AD Carry players do have massive egos, but again, I don't think that like, I think
[7483.44s -> 7488.44s]  support players are genuinely the dumbest motherfucking humans on the planet, and they
[7488.44s -> 7491.64s]  think that they're the best players to ever touch the game.
[7491.64s -> 7493.48s]  And it hurts my fucking balls.
[7493.48s -> 7527.24s]  Hey Lulu, would you be willing to have a VOD review with me in Discord after the game?
[7527.24s -> 7528.24s]  Let's just see.
[7528.24s -> 7530.64s]  if like this person is willing to listen to reason.
[7532.24s -> 7557.17s]  Let's see.
[7557.17s -> 7559.81s]  I'm trying to not tilt, but it's really frustrating.
[7561.23s -> 7564.03s]  Cause this player is playing specifically for KDA
[7565.55s -> 7567.95s]  and they're playing like they don't understand how,
[7567.95s -> 7569.53s]  like I can already tell you,
[7569.53s -> 7571.83s]  if I go look at this person's OP.GG,
[7571.83s -> 7573.15s]  they only play for KDA.
[7573.15s -> 7575.57s]  I can tell you right now, right here,
[7575.57s -> 7580.03s]  this person plays only for KDA, never takes any risks,
[7580.03s -> 7582.99s]  Doesn't ever help their AD carry ever when they get behind,
[7582.99s -> 7585.63s]  doesn't ever walk up to like try and fight,
[7585.63s -> 7586.71s]  doesn't do any of that.
[7586.71s -> 7588.39s]  I can tell you right now without even looking at their
[7588.39s -> 7590.91s]  OP.GG from how this person plays,
[7590.91s -> 7598.56s]  that they have high KDAs, but really low win rate.
[7598.56s -> 7600.28s]  But I don't want my entire stream to be bitching
[7600.28s -> 7602.00s]  about this Lulu, so we'll try and focus on how to win
[7602.00s -> 7603.80s]  from this position.
[7603.80s -> 7605.80s]  So I'm sure you guys get shitty supports too.
[7605.80s -> 7606.92s]  So we'll try and focus on how to win
[7606.92s -> 7620.29s]  from the current position we're in.
[7620.29s -> 7621.23s]  Yeah, it doesn't get better.
[7621.23s -> 7622.91s]  I mean, I'll be honest with you,
[7622.91s -> 7625.47s]  my Grandmaster supports on my main suck.
[7625.47s -> 7627.59s]  Like, it doesn't get better.
[7627.59s -> 7630.43s]  They get better like mechanically at the game, right?
[7630.43s -> 7633.95s]  Like, the higher ELO supports get better mechanically,
[7633.95s -> 7637.31s]  but they get worse, they don't get better when like,
[7637.31s -> 7638.47s]  it doesn't get better.
[7638.47s -> 7640.47s]  It's always like, you'll either have a really good support
[7640.47s -> 7649.79s]  or you'll have somebody who sniffs glue.
[7649.79s -> 7653.55s]  I'm just dead.
[7653.55s -> 7654.39s]  Or I'm not dead.
[7677.06s -> 7678.66s]  Honestly, our biggest issue here is
[7678.66s -> 7681.82s]  I need to get Bloodthirster ASAP.
[7681.82s -> 7692.60s]  Once I get BT, the game gets a lot easier.
[7692.60s -> 7694.92s]  We could kill this guy right now.
[7694.92s -> 7695.88s]  If the Lulu helps me,
[7695.88s -> 7698.48s]  we can actually just straight kill these guys.
[7698.48s -> 7700.36s]  Because I can ulti to heal myself, right?
[7700.36s -> 7702.80s]  We have Lulu ult, I have ult to heal myself,
[7702.80s -> 7703.64s]  and I'm strong.
[7704.76s -> 7707.12s]  She has ignite, I have ult, I have everything.
[7707.12s -> 7711.68s]  We could easily kill that Taliyah right there.
[7713.72s -> 7715.92s]  I mean, yeah, whatever, man.
[7715.92s -> 7721.52s]  This is what I'm talking about.
[7721.52s -> 7726.52s]  Again, are you willing to get into Discord and VOD review?
[7727.84s -> 7737.00s]  Yes or no?
[7737.00s -> 7741.20s]  I mean, I have to be honest with you.
[7741.20s -> 7742.44s]  The reason this is frustrating
[7742.44s -> 7744.48s]  is because as an AD carry player,
[7744.48s -> 7747.82s]  you want to be able to rely on your support, right?
[7747.82s -> 7750.44s]  You want to be able to make plays, go in, fight,
[7750.44s -> 7751.48s]  and rely on your teammates.
[7751.48s -> 7753.24s]  Because as an AD carry player,
[7753.24s -> 7754.72s]  support and AD are like a duo, right?
[7754.72s -> 7756.16s]  Like you wanna play together.
[7757.52s -> 7759.82s]  No, no man, I'm not attacking you.
[7759.82s -> 7763.08s]  I'm saying let's discord after
[7764.14s -> 7777.42s]  You can explain your POV and I'll explain mine. Maybe we can like improve this player
[7778.36s -> 7781.98s]  Like get them to be a better player and not ruin every game they play in
[7782.56s -> 7786.00s]  Like that would be that would be the goat
[7790.74s -> 7794.62s]  like the app that did not hit me by the way that hitbox was BS, but I
[7804.30s -> 7809.46s]  Don't even understand. Oh
[7810.18s -> 7811.34s]  man
[7811.34s -> 7818.62s]  This is the person's
[7818.62s -> 7824.15s]  By the way, this is the person who's op.gg
[7824.15s -> 7828.15s]  Average win rate, 50% win rate like I said
[7828.15s -> 7831.15s]  Has really good KDAs on all his champs
[7831.15s -> 7833.15s]  But he doesn't win
[7833.15s -> 7836.59s]  I'm telling you right now
[7836.59s -> 7841.59s]  The biggest thing in League, the fakest thing in League of Legends
[7841.59s -> 7845.59s]  Is believing that you are a good player based on KDA
[7845.59s -> 7849.59s]  If I go look at any challenger level support player right now
[7849.59s -> 7854.67s]  Their KDAs will be like 4.
[7854.67s -> 7857.51s]  They'll still have good KDA, but it'll be like 4 and 3.
[7857.51s -> 7861.47s]  And it'll be on, that's your mutual?
[7861.47s -> 7867.67s]  I'm gonna be real with you right now, T. This Lulu player, like, you could tell me that
[7867.67s -> 7872.51s]  this person sniffed glue as a kid and their parents never told them to stop, and I would
[7872.51s -> 7874.11s]  believe you.
[7874.11s -> 7875.11s]  I'm not even memeing.
[7875.11s -> 7876.11s]  Like, I would say that makes sense.
[7876.11s -> 7879.47s]  I mean, like I said, I don't even care.
[7879.47s -> 7883.71s]  I don't care if it's a girl a guy the e-girl thing is like that doesn't bother me right like like it could be a
[7883.71s -> 7887.49s]  Girl a guy a pigeon they could they could fucking they could
[7888.09s -> 7892.99s]  Relate as a fucking peanut in a in a fucking plane. I don't care about that at all
[7893.35s -> 7898.09s]  You don't mean like so that shit doesn't bother me at all
[7899.21s -> 7903.49s]  Like then be like I actually think it's stupid when people are like, oh, it's an e-girl e guy
[7903.49s -> 7907.69s]  Like I think that's dumb as shit because that arguments so crap
[7907.69s -> 7911.73s]  Because like I don't give a shit if it's a guy or girl because like, you know what I mean?
[7911.73s -> 7915.03s]  I'm more upset at the fact that this person is delusional than anything
[7915.85s -> 7929.96s]  That's like what's tilting me here. I'm just gonna mute
[7930.56s -> 7935.44s]  We'll do one more game on this account after this game and I'm gonna mute from the start of the game for you guys
[7935.44s -> 7942.30s]  Okay
[7942.30s -> 7945.26s]  Dude, if he didn't actually get me into the wall there
[7945.26s -> 7949.50s]  I tried to walk forward so that I wouldn't get condemned in the wall if he didn't stun me I kill him
[7950.38s -> 7952.38s]  That's annoying
[7952.38s -> 7955.86s]  That was actually such a good hitbox for him.
[7955.86s -> 7970.59s]  My bad.
[7970.59s -> 7971.59s]  Nice.
[7971.59s -> 7972.59s]  Huge shutdown.
[7972.59s -> 7973.59s]  Nice job.
[7973.59s -> 7976.27s]  If you're wondering why I'm even here, by the way, I'm actually, I'm not trolling.
[7976.27s -> 7979.51s]  I'm trying to get this turret because this gives me a lot of gold.
[7979.51s -> 7982.23s]  At the moment, I'm not actually worth that much gold.
[7982.23s -> 7983.33s]  There's nothing going on in the map.
[7983.33s -> 7984.83s]  There's no objective or anything like that.
[7984.83s -> 7985.83s]  Right?
[7985.83s -> 7990.33s]  So I'm trying to push in top waves right now so that I can get gold to try and like
[7990.33s -> 7994.35s]  hyper inflate my two item before this next dragon, because this next dragon is going
[7994.35s -> 7997.33s]  to be incredibly important if we want any chance to win.
[7998.33s -> 7999.79s]  We have to win this next Dragon.
[8000.43s -> 8002.49s]  And the only way for me to do that is to either
[8002.49s -> 8006.79s]  get really lucky, or go get some gold in a side lane.
[8007.91s -> 8009.61s]  It's just support difference every game.
[8009.61s -> 8012.13s]  It is. I want to point this out.
[8012.13s -> 8015.37s]  This person is playing this victim complex bullshit.
[8015.37s -> 8017.19s]  Like, you know what I mean? But it is.
[8017.19s -> 8018.51s]  It is actually support diff.
[8018.51s -> 8057.03s]  Sorry. I'm tilted. I'm playing bad this game.
[8057.03s -> 8061.71s]  I need to mute these players because these players are actually tilting me
[8063.11s -> 8066.85s]  Like I was fine with it before but I'm actually getting a little irritated that's make me play bad
[8067.69s -> 8069.99s]  So I need to mute them so I don't keep inting
[8072.13s -> 8074.77s]  Like it's affecting my gameplay and it's pissing me off
[8076.93s -> 8078.45s]  That's just my bad
[8078.45s -> 8087.71s]  T split. Are you here T?
[8088.59s -> 8090.87s]  Yo T message this Lulu. I
[8091.51s -> 8094.91s]  Mean this in the nicest way. I don't even want to be toxic. I
[8094.91s -> 8097.47s]  I genuinely want to use this for content
[8100.81s -> 8102.81s]  Like this guy's been flaming me the whole game
[8103.13s -> 8109.33s]  Like I want to use this for content to show you guys that it is so easy to tell people how the game should be played
[8109.97s -> 8113.23s]  So easy if you if you can communicate by talking
[8116.75s -> 8120.43s]  Because this guy's been doing nothing but flaming me the entire game this Lulu, right?
[8120.55s -> 8127.51s]  But he's an absolute like he played the lane completely bad then he then he stopped trying to win
[8127.51s -> 8130.43s]  and stop shielding me, stop doing anything, right?
[8130.43s -> 8133.93s]  After he played the lane bad.
[8133.93s -> 8135.43s]  Then he started playing the victim thing
[8135.43s -> 8136.57s]  when I asked him to be a human
[8136.57s -> 8138.93s]  and like come over and like help me and play teamwork.
[8138.93s -> 8141.35s]  You gotta remember, I didn't flame him a single time.
[8141.35s -> 8143.01s]  Right, like I didn't say a single negative thing
[8143.01s -> 8143.85s]  to this guy in game.
[8143.85s -> 8145.65s]  I said, let's work as a team.
[8145.65s -> 8146.49s]  He got upset.
[8150.87s -> 8152.73s]  Like I genuinely think it'd be great content
[8152.73s -> 8154.85s]  if I could talk to this guy in Discord.
[8154.85s -> 8173.98s]  And just like, oh, it'd be so good.
[8173.98s -> 8179.56s]  Like dude, I'm trying to kill these people guys.
[8179.56s -> 8182.00s]  That wasn't bad though, we got 800 gold.
[8182.00s -> 8185.40s]  Not the worst, but I don't know if my team can stall this.
[8185.40s -> 8187.16s]  Maybe if they can like kill this, they can stall it,
[8187.16s -> 8194.18s]  but nah, yeah, that's GG.
[8194.18s -> 8196.12s]  That was a disgusting Taliyah W.
[8234.34s -> 8236.88s]  All right, I'm gonna add him and he'll probably not add me,
[8236.88s -> 8241.21s]  but I might as well try.
[8241.21s -> 8252.25s]  This would be such a good learning experience.
[8252.25s -> 8253.65s]  Oh, excuse me.
[8253.65s -> 8255.37s]  Dude, I've had like bad heartburn today.
[8255.37s -> 8262.59s]  I need to take one of those heartburn pills.
[8262.59s -> 8263.61s]  What, Lulu?
[8263.61s -> 8265.61s]  What man? Just say it. Just let it out.
[8266.41s -> 8267.13s]  Let it out.
[8269.85s -> 8270.89s]  Let it out, baby.
[8271.45s -> 8271.95s]  Yo.
[8272.89s -> 8273.39s]  Lulu.
[8275.36s -> 8277.36s]  Let's... just- just have a talk.
[8280.21s -> 8280.71s]  Yo.
[8281.49s -> 8282.21s]  Let's Discord.
[8283.69s -> 8284.89s]  We can bottom of you.
[8286.09s -> 8287.93s]  Since I'm so bad.
[8290.91s -> 8291.41s]  Yo.
[8297.55s -> 8298.05s]  Trust.
[8302.75s -> 8304.03s]  You- you just...
[8305.39s -> 8306.67s]  Blamed everyone...
[8307.31s -> 8308.03s]  But yourself.
[8308.95s -> 8310.95s]  But you didn't play correctly.
[8311.15s -> 8324.58s]  At all. You played lane completely wrong, didn't help each other, left people to die
[8324.58s -> 8366.36s]  on repeats, then played victim. I genuinely want to help you.
[8366.36s -> 8383.96s]  This guy screenshotted what I just said and put it in the end game chat. What is happening
[8383.96s -> 8392.36s]  right now what is going on there is no way that this is not an npc
[8399.88s -> 8405.48s]  there is no way this is not an npc there's no way
[8407.48s -> 8423.02s]  there's no way it's geronimo lamau it is me yes bro just come talk in discord i'm not even gonna
[8423.02s -> 8438.89s]  flame you what does this even mean bro i don't think i've seen anybody more insecure in my life
[8440.92s -> 8456.25s]  bro you are so insecure it's cringe how insecure you are like oof good luck man on the climb
[8456.25s -> 8475.34s]  I don't even know what to say, I'm going to be real, I'm not even going to flame the guy,
[8475.34s -> 8481.34s]  I just genuinely want to improve the community.
[8481.34s -> 8486.18s]  Because that was 3 straight supports in a row that didn't know how to play Lulu, and
[8486.18s -> 8490.30s]  I'm not even going to flame the guy's skill, he's not a Lulu player, he doesn't play Lulu,
[8490.30s -> 8497.26s]  fine but the issue was that i had with that guy specifically was that it's okay to be bad at the
[8497.26s -> 8503.02s]  game right there's nothing wrong with being bad at league everybody has bad games but when we're
[8503.02s -> 8507.26s]  playing a game together and you're saying it's winnable and you want to win the game you can't
[8507.26s -> 8514.22s]  pick and choose who to like help win the game like if i'm sitting there bot lane we're both
[8514.22s -> 8519.98s]  being dove by jhin and you're intentionally trying not to take damage and not die because
[8519.98s -> 8526.62s]  you want to value your KDA over everything else so that i you know what hold on let me think about
[8526.62s -> 8534.38s]  this i think i figured this person out this person lives in delusion and i think i figured this out
[8534.38s -> 8538.14s]  let me let me explain this a lot of players do this but i think i'm figuring this out as i'm as
[8538.14s -> 8545.26s]  i'm thinking about this so this person has really good KDAs on their profile right this like this
[8545.26s -> 8548.30s]  eye-catching person. They have really really good KDAs in their profile, right?
[8549.34s -> 8555.98s]  This person doesn't ever take risks, doesn't ever do anything to try and win the game outside of
[8555.98s -> 8563.80s]  like just the existing and hitting buttons, and what they do is they will always have good KDAs,
[8564.68s -> 8569.16s]  and they will they will sit here and never- like I know why they're losing. They will sit here and
[8569.16s -> 8573.32s]  they will do this shit where they have good KDAs, they don't ever die that much, blah blah blah,
[8573.32s -> 8578.56s]  But what they do is they lie to themselves and they say look how good my KDAs are
[8579.02s -> 8585.42s]  If I had better teammates, I'd always win like I
[8586.24s -> 8588.24s]  Cracked the code actually
[8588.64s -> 8592.06s]  That's totally what it is. The players actually like
[8592.58s -> 8596.42s]  Play so safe and they play to like for statistics, right?
[8596.50s -> 8603.08s]  They play like purely for the stats and then they can say that it was their team's fault that they didn't win
[8603.46s -> 8605.20s]  Because they played
[8605.20s -> 8616.82s]  Really bad, but they didn't die because I mean in theory I could have a perfect KDA on every ad carry I play
[8617.34s -> 8623.42s]  Right. All I'd have to do is literally walk walk up get one kill and then afk and stand at the base the rest of
[8623.42s -> 8628.10s]  The game and I could be like yo, why is my team not able to carry what's happening?
[8631.13s -> 8636.43s]  Right, but you can literally do that. No, I I seriously think the person's self gaslighting himself
[8637.65s -> 8643.21s]  Like I'm serious. I think this person's like self gaslighting where they're like, oh, it's my team's fault every game
[8643.49s -> 8649.41s]  Right, like they're always blaming their team for their their their loses and their mistakes and shits and it's sad because like
[8649.97s -> 8653.13s]  There's a reason you're d2 and I'm not saying that to be toxic
[8653.13s -> 8655.13s]  I'm saying that like you haven't improved in four years
[8655.49s -> 8659.29s]  And you haven't improved because all you're doing is playing to blame your team every single game
[8659.43s -> 8664.37s]  When I just saw like 500 mistakes that you made that we could have won the game off of early game
[8671.28s -> 8676.56s]  Here, I remember somebody wanted me to play a Caitlyn game last game. So we're gonna play Kate. I
[8676.56s -> 8680.84s]  I don't remember. I don't remember who it was in the chat. Somebody's like two people said Kate
[8681.36s -> 8683.36s]  But we'll do a cake game for you guys. I
[8684.16s -> 8703.93s]  Got you boys. Don't worry. All right, I'm gonna take
[8704.73s -> 8711.37s]  Ghost flash because they have three melee champs for melee champs. They have they have for Khan Zedd Kled Gragas. So I'm gonna take ghost flash
[8713.01s -> 8714.81s]  These are gonna be my runes this game
[8714.81s -> 8718.13s]  I'm gonna take a little more mr because I don't think we're gonna be fighting too much in lane
[8718.33s -> 8721.49s]  We're pretty much just gonna be poking them with karma Kate
[8721.49s -> 8724.85s]  So I'm going to take a little bit of extra MR because I'm going to be playing for mid
[8724.85s -> 8725.85s]  to late game.
[8725.85s -> 8726.85s]  I'm just scaling.
[8726.85s -> 8739.17s]  And these are going to be the runes that I take, given class on AD carry or the easier
[8739.17s -> 8740.17s]  to play ones.
[8740.17s -> 8744.45s]  In AD carry, I usually do, like when I'm playing on this account right now, this is like my
[8744.45s -> 8746.41s]  teaching account.
[8746.41s -> 8747.41s]  It's a little lower MMR, right?
[8747.41s -> 8749.29s]  It's like D1 low masters.
[8749.29s -> 8754.93s]  I usually play AD carries that like the chat wants to see me play so that you guys can
[8754.93s -> 8761.73s]  learn like good and bad matchups and things like that the last two games i got way too tilted by
[8761.73s -> 8766.29s]  shitty support players like egos and all that shit i got way too frustrated and i played bad
[8766.29s -> 8770.69s]  the last two games so we're gonna honestly i'm just gonna i think i'm just gonna mute these
[8770.69s -> 8774.45s]  people at the very start of the game normally i wouldn't suggest you mute people because
[8775.01s -> 8779.89s]  like playing as a team is really important uh because like you know you need to communicate
[8779.89s -> 8787.25s]  and all that shit but I am just like I'm gonna mute them because I dude my mental is taking a
[8787.25s -> 8794.95s]  fucking hit right now so we're gonna just chill and play. I just don't know how to play Nyla
[8795.75s -> 8798.31s]  I think Nyla is really good I just don't I don't know how to play her
[8800.07s -> 8806.44s]  I think she's a great champ like I've been getting shit on by Nyla on my main account
[8807.96s -> 8821.28s]  like a lot of Grandmaster Nylas have been dumpstering me I think she's just really good
[8821.28s -> 8827.60s]  at abusing solo queue. Like the issue with Nyla is from what I've seen, all the losses
[8827.60s -> 8833.32s]  I've had with Nyla, people don't, um, it's like the thing I was telling you about before.
[8833.32s -> 8838.08s]  People don't play aggressively in the lower elos. Like, uh, even in grandmaster, people
[8838.08s -> 8842.00s]  don't play like aggressively enough. It sounds crazy to say that, but it's true. They don't
[8842.00s -> 8846.50s]  play aggressively enough in lane. So you can get away with just picking Nyla and scaling
[8846.50s -> 8850.12s]  and Nyla at like one item, you'll always be up in levels, right? Because that's how the
[8850.12s -> 8855.56s]  champion works the champion works in like you'll always be up in levels because of her passive so
[8858.12s -> 8862.68s]  you basically just like scale through existing it's pretty it's pretty interesting
[8864.44s -> 8870.33s]  all right so we're playing kate karma oh i missed the minion because i suck
[8871.61s -> 8885.02s]  i'm gonna ward this bush uh just because i don't want the recon in the bush so now that the bush
[8885.02s -> 8889.42s]  isn't warded anymore um okay he warded it nice i was gonna say what i want to do is i actually want
[8889.42s -> 8896.36s]  want to play, oh I suck. I actually wanted to play, oh man I'm so bad at Cait. I wanted
[8896.36s -> 8901.48s]  to play on the top side of the wave so that I'm not standing near the bushes, right? Because
[8901.48s -> 8906.24s]  if you stand near the bushes, the Rakan can obviously like W me and I just get fucked.
[8906.24s -> 8912.84s]  So I'd rather play in a safer spot. Can't believe I missed two CS, I'm so fucking bad.
[8912.84s -> 8916.40s]  Now I want to push in wave three and I want to go buy a cull. So I'm going to ping to
[8916.40s -> 8931.40s]  push okay so i actually want to back here and i'm gonna go buy a call so this is called a cheater
[8931.40s -> 8939.72s]  recall you usually have perfect cs to back on this timer go and you can go buy a call okay
[8940.52s -> 8944.68s]  this is like something that you can do if you're in a lane that's going to be perma shoving
[8944.68s -> 8949.40s]  so what happens is the reason it's called the cheater recall is because we push the wave in
[8949.40s -> 8957.57s]  They had to stay and farm the wave, right? Now watch. They have to push this wave in, right?
[8958.13s -> 8962.13s]  Now if Karma was here instead of roaming, this roam is fine by the way, but if she was here
[8962.13s -> 8967.73s]  instead of roaming, she could actually hold the wave. And if you notice here, I don't actually
[8967.73s -> 8977.89s]  miss that many minions, right? We're chilling. Now we can soul push this, we're safe. I should
[8977.89s -> 8982.93s]  actually fast push this, because I want it to bounce. I don't want to soul push this, but I can't
[8982.93s -> 8993.33s]  uh, I can't fast push this at level three by myself, so we're just going to chill.
[8994.69s -> 9000.29s]  Haylen's really good at abusing like early lane phase bullying, just based on like what our kit
[9000.29s -> 9008.63s]  does. We see Rakan on the map top side, you guys see that? So because we see Rakan, I can walk up
[9008.63s -> 9020.50s]  a bit and we can play a little aggro here. You can kind of see like, I don't have to play behind
[9020.50s -> 9025.62s]  the minion wave. You see what I'm doing to this guy, right? I hate this game. We can quit. We can
[9025.62s -> 9036.55s]  forfeit. It's fine. I hate this game. I really hate this game. Dude, what is wrong with me right now?
[9036.55s -> 9048.48s]  It's like my brain doesn't work. It's the 280 Cait nerf, I'm telling you. So Rakan's going to be
[9048.48s -> 9056.16s]  bot right now. I know he's going to be bot, so I need to be a little care. Now my Karma is here.
[9056.16s -> 9062.37s]  There we go. So you notice I didn't use any spells. I'm not I'm just chillin
[9065.52s -> 9066.88s]  dude
[9066.88s -> 9068.88s]  Are you kidding me man?
[9068.92s -> 9074.22s]  I'm gonna be honest. I'm getting really tilted by these players now
[9074.74s -> 9076.74s]  Like the Rakan W's in
[9077.06s -> 9079.98s]  They just stand there and watch me die
[9081.42s -> 9085.58s]  Okay, it's fine. Listen, I'm not gonna get too mad about it. It's fine. I should have flashed the knockup
[9085.58s -> 9087.78s]  I guess even though in reality
[9087.78s -> 9089.42s]  I should never have to flash the knockup
[9089.42s -> 9095.00s]  But I should have flashed it because I can't trust the teammates. So what I'm saying is right there karma and fiddle
[9095.00s -> 9099.72s]  We're both right here. I was being chased down. They stood here. They didn't they didn't walk up to do anything
[9099.96s -> 9101.96s]  They just stood and waited
[9102.62s -> 9105.28s]  That pisses me off because I hate when players
[9106.40s -> 9108.36s]  play
[9108.36s -> 9115.41s]  Selfish and scared. It's my biggest pet peeve. It drives me fucking crazy, man
[9116.69s -> 9118.69s]  Sorry, I'm getting I'm losing my mind
[9118.69s -> 9129.74s]  Like it's so easy. It's fine though. I shouldn't have walked up and egoed it. It's on me.
[9129.74s -> 9142.66s]  I want to soul push this wave.
[9142.66s -> 9154.51s]  Dude, I'm losing it.
[9154.51s -> 9162.06s]  This by the way would be an example of a bad time for Karma to roam. She needs to come back bot.
[9162.06s -> 9164.06s]  There's absolutely no reason for her to roam on that timer.
[9164.06s -> 9167.06s]  There's also no reason for her to be in that bush over there.
[9167.06s -> 9170.06s]  We should be playing up to try- we're playing Cait Karma, right?
[9170.06s -> 9173.06s]  We should be playing forward so that we can actually be aggressive.
[9173.06s -> 9177.06s]  Cait Karma's a lane bully lane. We don't want to sit here and just do nothing.
[9177.06s -> 9181.10s]  If you pick karma, you want to be aggressive you want to be playing up you want to be stunning you want to be
[9181.10s -> 9183.10s]  Doing like aggressive things playing the game
[9186.45s -> 9198.53s]  Level six. I'd really like to like go in. Yeah, like that was actually not bad by the karma
[9198.53s -> 9202.01s]  She w'd the Zaya and then I got to trap off of it. So that wasn't too bad
[9203.33s -> 9224.26s]  Not the worst not not bad. That was good. That was good
[9225.46s -> 9243.75s]  Really nice really nice. Okay, so I'm gonna back here cuz I don't want to overstay for the wave. I'm gonna grab boots
[9243.75s -> 9252.72s]  You know what I think a lot of it is too, I think a lot of it is people get really scared
[9252.72s -> 9254.86s]  when they, like Rakan is really strong in this meta, right?
[9254.86s -> 9256.50s]  Like he's very, very powerful.
[9256.50s -> 9258.66s]  He's like numbers are a little too high right now.
[9258.66s -> 9261.18s]  So like everything he does is just a little too good.
[9261.18s -> 9264.56s]  So I think people get nervous around Rakan, especially with Xayah, because it's like when
[9264.56s -> 9267.94s]  people would get nervous around Nami, Lucian, the lane like plays itself.
[9267.94s -> 9268.94s]  It's very strong.
[9268.94s -> 9272.02s]  It's very hard to beat, but you can still see people making mistakes when they play
[9272.02s -> 9273.02s]  the lane.
[9273.02s -> 9280.43s]  So you got to watch for that type of stuff.
[9280.43s -> 9292.55s]  Now a good way to play against a Xayah when she hits 6 is you don't want to ever walk
[9292.55s -> 9297.11s]  melee range of her or give her the ability to just kill you with the feathers.
[9297.11s -> 9302.75s]  Your main goal here is going to be to try and stay in a good spot when it comes to feathers.
[9302.75s -> 9304.83s]  I want to be to the side of her.
[9304.83s -> 9307.55s]  The side of her is the best option, where she can't pull in.
[9307.55s -> 9312.89s]  I'll get hit by maybe a few, but she can't pull in all of them.
[9312.89s -> 9317.69s]  That's a really key thing when playing versus her, because I remember back in the day I
[9317.69s -> 9321.45s]  didn't know how to play Versaia and I would always get fucking frustrated as shit.
[9321.45s -> 9322.45s]  So Rakan's five.
[9322.45s -> 9325.45s]  I want to hit tab, see Rakan's five.
[9325.45s -> 9329.79s]  We shouldn't be able to die here.
[9329.79s -> 9336.22s]  I want to push this wave in, but I also need to stay away from where the Rakan could be.
[9336.22s -> 9341.12s]  So if you want to push waves in and reset the wave, make sure that you're standing as
[9341.12s -> 9349.23s]  far away as you can from where they can engage on you.
[9349.23s -> 9351.07s]  Now they're about to be six, Rakan is.
[9351.07s -> 9352.59s]  So they have a really strong level six.
[9352.59s -> 9354.55s]  She has pickaxe and noon quiver.
[9354.55s -> 9356.03s]  We do want to be a little hesitant here.
[9356.03s -> 9357.19s]  We don't want to fight.
[9358.63s -> 9360.91s]  Now I'm going to kind of push this in a bit.
[9361.87s -> 9363.85s]  We should have been spam pushing the whole wave
[9363.85s -> 9365.15s]  because that's how Kate Karma plays.
[9365.15s -> 9368.23s]  We just push, push, push, push.
[9368.23s -> 9371.59s]  But we played that early roam by Karma
[9372.79s -> 9374.47s]  kind of put us behind on that.
[9375.63s -> 9376.45s]  It's not a big deal.
[9376.45s -> 9388.52s]  just something that we have to adjust. Why does this say 88 and this say 90? Which one
[9388.52s -> 9411.85s]  is it? Is it 88 or 90? I mean that guy's dead. I don't know what that Karma's thinking but
[9411.85s -> 9422.08s]  we probably have to give this Drake. I mean maybe we could fight it if Fiddle had ulti
[9422.08s -> 9436.74s]  but him not having ult, yeah there's no way. The higher one counts ward kills? Why? I think
[9436.74s -> 9444.34s]  so stupid. So they might try and engage here. Unless they somehow know Fiddle's in the bush,
[9444.34s -> 9449.39s]  which would be impressive because we know it's not warded. So that'd be pretty impressive
[9449.39s -> 9478.68s]  if they knew that. We could actually rift. I'm just going to ghost. This is crazy. What
[9478.68s -> 9488.54s]  the fuck? Oh, this is interesting. They saw Fiddle 100%. Yeah, I don't know where though.
[9488.54s -> 9490.54s]  It must it cuz he used this thing
[9491.58s -> 9493.58s]  But I'll use his whatever it's called
[9494.18s -> 9497.28s]  his effigy
[9497.28s -> 9504.34s]  I'd have to go look one minute. Oh, I guess I didn't see it. I
[9506.42s -> 9508.42s]  Should back I can get dove here
[9508.58s -> 9512.50s]  We don't know where Greg is like if Greg is happens to be like he's over this wall or something
[9512.50s -> 9515.98s]  I can get dove really easy. I'm greeting really hard
[9517.10s -> 9519.10s]  Greeting usually gets you killed
[9519.10s -> 9520.74s]  typically I
[9520.74s -> 9524.02s]  Shouldn't be doing this
[9524.02s -> 9527.54s]  They're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right?
[9528.18s -> 9529.82s]  it's like
[9529.82s -> 9536.14s]  If you know something's gonna be a bad habit, you should not do it. Just cue the bush
[9537.88s -> 9546.20s]  Okay, that was I meant use like an actual cue they could also be in the alcove so I'm a little hesitant but it's fine
[9552.02s -> 9556.24s]  Okay. So the reason I stayed was because now I have my I have my mythic, right?
[9556.94s -> 9561.06s]  Because we we finished the coal and we finished the mythic at the same time or finished the wave. So
[9561.06s -> 9568.22s]  Now I have two options, I can go Galeforce here to dodge a lot of their shits or I can
[9568.22s -> 9575.18s]  do what sounds like a fun option, we're going to do shield bow, I'm going to show you guys
[9575.18s -> 9581.90s]  why I like shield bow on Caitlyn, it's not the best mythic but it's good into certain
[9581.90s -> 9591.62s]  comps if you don't want to get Gale, because I have alacrity this game, I don't have bloodline
[9591.62s -> 9603.65s]  right so i kind of want to go shield bow and then i'm gonna end up going uh either ie or
[9603.65s -> 9613.81s]  i'm gonna end up going like bloodthirster seconds ie or bt probably ie just because uh
[9615.41s -> 9626.60s]  i think i think it's actually easier to go ie this game but yeah this is a kind of boring game
[9626.60s -> 9655.88s]  our team's doing really well though so we just chill we got to be a little care okay it was
[9655.88s -> 9660.24s]  It was kind of hard to do anything there, even though I got a few autos on the Gragas,
[9660.24s -> 9667.48s]  it's a little difficult to actually play the game there.
[9667.48s -> 9672.10s]  Because if I walk up too far, like see Rakan's there, if I walk up too far, I just get killed
[9672.10s -> 9675.31s]  by Rakan.
[9675.31s -> 9680.28s]  All right, I'm just going to reset and go get boots.
[9680.28s -> 9688.06s]  Typically AD carry is really fucking boring in games like this, where you can't really
[9688.06s -> 9689.06s]  blow the game open.
[9689.06s -> 9693.55s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[9693.55s -> 9694.55s]  Maybe?
[9694.55s -> 9697.55s]  Wait, Karma shielded me, I'm not dead.
[9697.55s -> 9700.76s]  Nice.
[9700.76s -> 9701.76s]  Fuck!
[9701.76s -> 9702.76s]  Motherfucker Kobe'd me, man.
[9702.76s -> 9727.12s]  He was just like, Kobe!
[9727.12s -> 9734.69s]  We can fight this though, they have no ults.
[9734.69s -> 9742.01s]  Like this is actually fightable, they have no Xayah R and no Gragas R.
[9742.01s -> 9745.71s]  And this is also why it's really important that you relay to your team the cooldowns
[9745.71s -> 9746.71s]  of your team.
[9746.71s -> 9747.71s]  Remember that.
[9747.71s -> 9748.71s]  Don't forget that.
[9748.71s -> 9751.49s]  If somebody uses a big cooldown, tell your team.
[9751.49s -> 9755.09s]  Because that was an illegal dragon, right, like they just, that was one of the most
[9755.09s -> 9779.80s]  illegal things i've seen in a while homie completely griefed that that's another very very very important
[9779.80s -> 9783.72s]  thing that you need to take away from playing league and being like this is what i was saying
[9783.72s -> 9789.80s]  about teamwork and shit earlier being good at the game is a lot of spreading knowledge as well right
[9791.16s -> 9795.40s]  like if you if your team doesn't know if a flash is up or down you have to play completely
[9795.40s -> 9798.84s]  differently right like you got to think about the game in that in terms of that as well like
[9798.84s -> 9801.42s]  Like how many times have you seen like, you know, you're like,
[9801.42s -> 9804.24s]  Oh, I can walk up here if this guy can't flash ult me or something. Right.
[9808.33s -> 9814.94s]  It happens all the time. I wonder if I can kill a Duskblade Zed. I don't know.
[9820.37s -> 9832.28s]  I probably could. Uh, I should go mid.
[9835.51s -> 9838.39s]  What do you think about Teemo and other top lane as AD carry?
[9840.50s -> 9845.10s]  I play Teemo AD carry when I'm playing for fun sometimes. It's okay.
[9854.19s -> 9858.23s]  Yo, go look on your game, man. So during the mid game as Caitlyn,
[9858.39s -> 9860.27s]  a few things that I can kind of teach you,
[9860.27s -> 9863.39s]  This was kind of a boring lane phase right like we didn't really do that much
[9863.79s -> 9868.87s]  The lane phase was essentially just like we died once and then you know everything all hell broke loose
[9869.91s -> 9871.91s]  When you're walking up to fights like this
[9872.43s -> 9874.79s]  Make sure that you're putting traps down in places
[9875.63s -> 9884.98s]  Where the enemy has to walk just like that
[9885.70s -> 9890.02s]  Playing 80 playing Caitlyn is not always about just like autoing and getting queues and shit
[9890.06s -> 9893.98s]  If you noticed during that fight, I put two traps here two traps here
[9893.98s -> 9900.81s]  I forced the enemy team into like a location where they had to eat traps or they
[9901.53s -> 9908.20s]  They can't find us right and even if like they avoid the traps
[9908.20s -> 9914.40s]  They're still having to like move their character in a very unique specific way that they probably don't want to do
[9914.84s -> 9921.23s]  So you should always be thinking where should I put these traps down at the start of a fight?
[9921.23s -> 9922.87s]  Not like how do I get autos off?
[9922.87s -> 9928.35s]  think about using your traps to zone and that I control the team fight before the fight starts rather than using it to
[9928.35s -> 9933.35s]  to do damage because they'll step in the traps themselves.
[9934.27s -> 9936.55s]  People will just, people are stupid.
[9936.55s -> 9937.39s]  They're bad.
[9937.39s -> 9938.67s]  People aren't paying attention.
[9938.67s -> 9939.51s]  Everything.
[9939.51s -> 9941.07s]  I'm bad.
[9941.07s -> 9941.91s]  You know what I mean?
[9941.91s -> 9943.31s]  People can't pay attention to every bush
[9943.31s -> 9945.51s]  that you're putting traps in during a big fight.
[9945.51s -> 9947.29s]  It's too much attention span.
[9947.29s -> 9961.89s]  Nobody has it.
[9961.89s -> 9964.38s]  Nice.
[9964.38s -> 9967.57s]  I'm gonna go grab this red.
[9967.57s -> 9969.85s]  Oh, big tip for all the AD carries in chat.
[9969.85s -> 9972.65s]  Guys, I'm gonna tell you right now,
[9972.65s -> 9975.25s]  Once the 20 minute mark happens in League,
[9975.25s -> 9977.29s]  your junglers camps are no longer his.
[9978.33s -> 9981.13s]  I know, I know junglers are gonna hate me for this, okay?
[9981.13s -> 9982.21s]  Listen, if you're a jungle player
[9982.21s -> 9983.81s]  and you're like, fuck this guy now, I hate him.
[9983.81s -> 9985.45s]  Listen, you know it's true.
[9985.45s -> 9988.49s]  You know at 20 minutes, your camps no longer,
[9988.49s -> 9991.05s]  like, they're not yours anymore, man, okay?
[9991.05s -> 9994.09s]  Like, you are full items at this point, okay?
[9994.09s -> 9995.57s]  Like, I wanna be honest.
[9996.73s -> 10000.46s]  I'm taking your camps.
[10000.46s -> 10001.70s]  I'm trying to get my third item
[10001.70s -> 10010.71s]  as fast as humanly possible.
[10010.71s -> 10021.19s]  because AD carries spike on three items extremely hard.
[10021.19s -> 10022.43s]  Man, I want to walk top,
[10022.43s -> 10023.83s]  but we have no vision of this area,
[10023.83s -> 10028.92s]  so it's a little scary.
[10028.92s -> 10031.68s]  Like I said, I typically don't like to take
[10031.68s -> 10034.36s]  jungles, camps, early game ever,
[10034.36s -> 10037.08s]  because like, that's why I say like at 20 minutes,
[10037.08s -> 10039.52s]  usually you have two items at this point.
[10039.52s -> 10042.40s]  If you're like farming decent and you know, et cetera.
[10042.40s -> 10043.36s]  Sometimes it'll be faster,
[10043.36s -> 10044.72s]  but usually it's around average
[10044.72s -> 10048.83s]  of like you'll have your items at this point.
[10048.83s -> 10050.65s]  Always be tabbing to the team fights,
[10050.65s -> 10073.52s]  even if you're farming as well.
[10073.52s -> 10079.72s]  Zed is in this bush.
[10079.72s -> 10080.56s]  Wait, where is he?
[10080.56s -> 10081.38s]  Wait, I'm stupid.
[10081.38s -> 10082.96s]  Where'd he go?
[10082.96s -> 10083.80s]  Oh, he died.
[10083.80s -> 10084.62s]  I killed him.
[10085.80s -> 10086.92s]  Wow, I'm really smart.
[10093.37s -> 10095.37s]  I didn't notice that I killed that guy.
[10096.33s -> 10102.78s]  I'm so dumb.
[10102.78s -> 10107.72s]  AD carry brain, right boys?
[10107.72s -> 10109.36s]  I was playing that so scared too,
[10109.36s -> 10111.56s]  because I was like, is he there?
[10121.40s -> 10122.44s]  Pull the dragon out.
[10124.28s -> 10125.12s]  Oh, I asked this yesterday,
[10125.12s -> 10127.40s]  but what do you guys think the coolest looking dragon is?
[10127.40s -> 10132.24s]  I swear it's the, I think mountain drake looks fucking sick.
[10168.92s -> 10172.12s]  So here you saw that I took the time to push mid, right?
[10173.80s -> 10178.88s]  That's mainly because our Karma just got picked off
[10178.88s -> 10181.32s]  and I don't want to give them the option
[10181.32s -> 10203.46s]  of pushing the wave, so by pushing the lane,
[10203.46s -> 10206.06s]  nice, by pushing the lane in,
[10206.06s -> 10208.54s]  it takes away an option for the enemy.
[10208.54s -> 10209.86s]  That's something that a lot of people think like,
[10209.86s -> 10210.74s]  oh, I just want farm.
[10210.74s -> 10212.06s]  I don't care about the farm, right?
[10212.06s -> 10217.18s]  Like, when I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game and I'm pushing like a
[10217.18s -> 10223.02s]  mid wave in before a fight, if we're just sieging around the baron, having that wave
[10223.02s -> 10227.90s]  pushed in gives us another option on like what we can do in the game.
[10227.90s -> 10233.82s]  And it takes you three seconds to push it in, so if the fight's already over and you
[10233.82s -> 10239.70s]  have time, always be paying attention to like trying to push in waves so that you can create
[10239.70s -> 10240.70s]  a little bit of that pressure.
[10240.70s -> 10242.78s]  Yo hail, thank you so much for the 14 man. Welcome back
[10243.70s -> 10246.20s]  What do I get next? I kind of want to get BT
[10247.02s -> 10254.01s]  I'm gonna get BT. I could get Dom's but I think BT is better because
[10254.53s -> 10258.97s]  The I already have overkill right? So the shield from BT plus shield bow plus IE
[10258.97s -> 10262.01s]  I don't think I'll be able to die. Okay, I think I'm unkillable
[10262.67s -> 10265.15s]  Act actually like actually unkillable
[10265.83s -> 10270.43s]  So here I'm gonna actually give these camps to Fiddle cuz he's literally pathing to them. I don't wanna be an asshole, but
[10270.43s -> 10297.96s]  Wow. What just happened? I'm bad. I feel like I got hooked by Kled. Oh, he flashed. Okay.
[10297.96s -> 10301.36s]  I was like, I feel like what just happened was like, I mispositioned. Cause like I went
[10301.36s -> 10304.76s]  up here, right? Like I ghosted one up here. Cause there was two people here, two people
[10304.76s -> 10308.92s]  here. I put traps down these kinds of sloppy traps. And then I positioned here and then
[10308.92s -> 10310.84s]  The Kled flash Q'd me under the turret.
[10310.84s -> 10312.84s]  Yeah, okay, that makes sense.
[10312.84s -> 10315.98s]  I'm just bad.
[10315.98s -> 10326.61s]  It was okay though, because if the entire enemy team has to literally double flash on
[10326.61s -> 10330.13s]  you to kill you under the turret, and then your team follows up, it's not that big of
[10330.13s -> 10331.13s]  a deal.
[10331.13s -> 10334.65s]  Galeforce would have saved me there though, actually.
[10334.65s -> 10339.26s]  Lowkey.
[10339.26s -> 10341.90s]  Galeforce totally would have saved me.
[10341.90s -> 10345.97s]  Because he has Serpents.
[10345.97s -> 10348.07s]  Serpents definitely shits on Chilbo.
[10348.07s -> 10353.35s]  I'm kind of stupid for going shield bow this game.
[10353.35s -> 10357.35s]  I wanted to try it out because before when I was playing Caitlyn, before the IE rework
[10357.35s -> 10362.23s]  and everything, everybody would go, or there was like one guy in challenger would go shield
[10362.23s -> 10366.75s]  bow into shit every game and I wanted to see if like it was still viable but there might
[10366.75s -> 10374.72s]  just be better options now like always scale force BT or something.
[10374.72s -> 10379.55s]  Oh my god I flashed late, I'm dead.
[10379.55s -> 10383.65s]  Dude, I flashed late for some reason, I'm so dumb.
[10383.65s -> 10384.49s]  My bad.
[10385.99s -> 10387.65s]  I'll just give him an MB.
[10387.65s -> 10390.39s]  Like my brain is moving slowly.
[10390.39s -> 10392.01s]  Like I can feel it turning.
[10393.11s -> 10394.21s]  I'm just playing bad.
[10395.09s -> 10397.67s]  Like I was baiting the Kled to go in on me
[10397.67s -> 10398.83s]  because Karma was there,
[10398.83s -> 10400.75s]  but what I need to do is I need to trap on top of myself
[10400.75s -> 10404.15s]  when he goes in, then I need to flash net,
[10404.15s -> 10407.36s]  and the Kled just dies.
[10407.36s -> 10408.72s]  You can also just kill him.
[10408.72s -> 10422.96s]  I was gonna say they have nothing. We just play for dragon here. I don't know why I'm
[10422.96s -> 10427.04s]  playing so bad today. I played bad yesterday too. I don't know what's going on. My brain
[10427.04s -> 10484.37s]  is broken. Dude, their Rakan was trying so hard. Oh, I've made so many mistakes this
[10484.37s -> 10500.59s]  game. I fucked up positioning, mechanics, farm, all kinds of shit. I still don't want
[10500.59s -> 10508.57s]  Lord Dom's, actually.
[10508.57s -> 10512.53s]  I don't think Lord Dom's is good this game.
[10512.53s -> 10514.09s]  Like, they have no armor.
[10514.09s -> 10515.57s]  Like, Kled has Merc Treads.
[10517.31s -> 10521.65s]  Which I feel like's really bad into our team, but.
[10531.52s -> 10534.32s]  Oh, a little tip that you guys can have for Caitlyn too.
[10534.32s -> 10538.28s]  When you are, like, Baron's up in 50 seconds, right?
[10538.28s -> 10541.36s]  So, a little thing you can do that's actually kinda fun
[10541.36s -> 10544.08s]  is you wanna be at the objective before the, like,
[10544.08s -> 10545.68s]  rule of thumb, when an objective's coming up,
[10545.68s -> 10551.48s]  always want to be on that side of the map before the before the objective comes up but
[10551.48s -> 10558.16s]  you can put down traps uh in the bushes around the objectives and people will face check
[10558.16s -> 10567.46s]  them and you can just one tap them late game it's actually incredibly fun like you just
[10567.46s -> 10576.92s]  put them in the corners of the bushes where people have to walk like right here i can put
[10576.92s -> 10593.36s]  it right between the turret i don't know why i didn't ghost i'll be honest i have no idea
[10593.36s -> 10599.35s]  Why didn't ghosts? I was like saving it for something. I'm not sure what
[10602.43s -> 10605.27s]  Next year a birthday present who the fuck knows. I
[10609.30s -> 10611.50s]  Could have one shot that guy if I was better at Kate. I
[10613.20s -> 10616.52s]  Did a really classic combo right there I just didn't queue cuz I'm bad I
[10618.50s -> 10621.80s]  Should have when he hit the trap your two headshots sit on him for a few seconds
[10621.80s -> 10625.68s]  So what I should have done is I should have instantly queued on top of the trap then auto auto and he would have died
[10626.16s -> 10631.28s]  Cuz your cue does the max damage when they're trapped too. So it would have been like just a perfect three shot
[10631.74s -> 10636.32s]  But like I said, I don't play Kayd enough and my muscle memory is kind of trash sometimes. So
[10637.66s -> 10651.06s]  That was my bad. Oh, we're getting clutted. I
[10651.98s -> 10653.98s]  Don't know where he is, but I
[10671.08s -> 10672.64s]  Shouldn't have done that
[10672.64s -> 10678.85s]  I'm limit testing really hard right now. I suggest you guys don't limit test
[10678.85s -> 10682.45s]  Well, actually I do think you should limit test but not if you want to win like play safer
[10682.45s -> 10685.93s]  Like right there the play wasn't to go back in the play was to like back off
[10685.93s -> 10687.93s]  but I wanted to see if I could like I
[10690.24s -> 10692.24s]  Wanted to see if I was terrible or not
[10693.16s -> 10696.16s]  You know? I was.
[10697.16s -> 10707.16s]  But yeah, I mean the combo with Cait is like, if they're trapped, you want to Q while they're in the trap, essentially, because your auto will always give you the range.
[10707.16s -> 10719.16s]  So if you auto and then Q, um, when they're trapped, they get, uh, not a lot of people know this, because I just found this out, like, a few years, or like, after I should've.
[10719.16s -> 10726.68s]  uh when you q on top of a k trap the way ksq works is when you q the initial like it hits
[10726.68s -> 10731.24s]  initially and then it does less damage to the targets behind it right it's very narrow and
[10731.24s -> 10737.32s]  then it like it like gets bigger so when they're trapped though it does the maximum q damage that
[10737.32s -> 10741.96s]  it can do in like the isolation of the q so that's why when people are trapped you want to
[10741.96s -> 10750.59s]  open up with your q you either want to net into the q and then double auto or you want to net or
[10750.59s -> 10755.15s]  or you wanna Q, then trap net at the same time,
[10755.15s -> 10756.35s]  then double auto.
[10756.35s -> 10759.19s]  You basically, it's a very interesting way to play.
[10759.19s -> 10762.05s]  You always wanna try and overlay a trap on your trap.
[10762.05s -> 10763.53s]  So when they get trapped,
[10763.53s -> 10765.75s]  you can overlay a second trap too,
[10765.75s -> 10767.71s]  either in front of them or behind them.
[10767.71s -> 10770.43s]  And what'll happen is there's actually like a little mini,
[10770.43s -> 10772.95s]  like I wanna say one second cooldown
[10772.95s -> 10774.03s]  of being able to be trapped, right?
[10774.03s -> 10776.33s]  Like a little 1.5, two second cooldown.
[10776.33s -> 10778.19s]  But what can happen is they sit in the trap,
[10778.19s -> 10780.27s]  then what you can do is your net can slow them.
[10780.27s -> 10783.07s]  So you can actually queue in the first trap,
[10783.07s -> 10784.95s]  then you can drop a second trap,
[10784.95s -> 10786.75s]  net slow them into the second trap,
[10786.75s -> 10788.23s]  and then triple auto headshot them
[10788.23s -> 10791.07s]  from all three of the net, the two traps.
[10791.07s -> 10796.92s]  It's really complicated sounding,
[10796.92s -> 10806.65s]  but this man is redeemed end my stream whenever you want.
[10813.50s -> 10817.19s]  What?
[10817.19s -> 10822.13s]  Why?
[10822.13s -> 10829.77s]  Why would you wanna end my stream right now?
[10829.77s -> 10838.27s]  Why would you wanna be that guy?
[10838.27s -> 10850.30s]  Wow, okay.
[10850.30s -> 10853.18s]  Don't end, just change the camera position.
[10854.62s -> 10859.65s]  Did you just spend one million points
[10859.65s -> 10861.69s]  to tell me to put the camera back
[10861.69s -> 10870.66s]  on the right side of my fucking, no way.
[10872.10s -> 10878.14s]  No way you just did that.
[10878.14s -> 10881.26s]  I was like, this man is just flexing.
[10881.26s -> 10883.86s]  He's just like, yeah, I got some points to spare.
[10883.86s -> 10889.69s]  I guess I could like throw them, you know, eh.
[10889.69s -> 10901.99s]  All right, fine.
[10901.99s -> 10903.83s]  There, is that better?
[10903.83s -> 10910.34s]  Is that better?
[10910.34s -> 10911.26s]  Drink water.
[10911.26s -> 10912.30s]  Actually, that's a good one.
[10912.30s -> 10916.29s]  I'll be right back, I'm gonna get some water.
[10916.29s -> 10918.15s]  Should we play on our main?
[10918.15s -> 10920.33s]  I kinda wanna try and hit GM.
[10920.33s -> 10921.31s]  Yeah, let's get on our main account.
[10921.31s -> 10924.21s]  It's like 1 p.m., so it's like 3 p.m. Eastern.
[10924.21s -> 10930.33s]  I think I can get queues at the moment.
[10930.33s -> 10933.21s]  Let me get some water, and then we'll queue up.
[10933.21s -> 10943.22s]  Or we'll queue up, then get some water real quick.
[10943.22s -> 10944.54s]  Because I think it's late enough in the day
[10944.54s -> 10953.02s]  I can get queues now without waiting 40 minutes.
[10953.02s -> 10955.74s]  By the way, it is a teaching stream
[10955.74s -> 10959.10s]  I'm doing that like ad carry academy thing so if you guys have any questions you want to ask or like
[10959.58s -> 10962.86s]  You guys can ignore that uh, if you guys have any questions you want to ask or anything like that
[10963.90s -> 10970.46s]  You know if we're just chilling between games just ask whatever you want. I'll I can answer a lot easier between games that I can't in-game
[10971.50s -> 10974.14s]  You know, it's a lot easier for me to see that shit. I try and answer in game
[10974.14s -> 10976.14s]  But like sometimes i'm like focusing and shit
[10976.46s -> 10984.77s]  So it's a little harder
[10984.77s -> 10987.97s]  Uh, I am gonna get some water though. So i'll be right back. Okay
[10989.33s -> 10991.33s]  Talk amongst yourselves
[10991.33s -> 10994.75s]  Is Kraken troll on Cait? No, Kraken's good on Cait
[10995.61s -> 11001.73s]  You can go Kraken into Bloodthirster or Kraken into IE if you really need it if if they have like tanks
[11001.73s -> 11003.73s]  So they have like Sion
[11003.93s -> 11007.01s]  Sejuani stuff like that that you have to like you're the only damage
[11007.01s -> 11011.91s]  Let's say you're like the only tank killer on the team. You're like the only AD damage. You have to go Kraken sometimes
[11011.91s -> 11073.91s]  Buh buh buh buh buh buh
[11075.53s -> 11077.53s]  Best day of my life
[12108.28s -> 12110.28s]  a
[12110.28s -> 12112.20s]  $10,000.
[12112.20s -> 12119.03s]  Alright.
[12119.03s -> 12121.03s]  Bye
[12121.03s -> 12123.03s]  .
[12123.03s -> 12125.03s]  .
[12125.03s -> 12127.03s]  .
[12127.03s -> 12129.03s]  .
[12129.03s -> 12131.03s]  .
[12131.03s -> 12133.03s]  .
[12133.03s -> 12135.03s]  .
[12135.03s -> 12137.03s]  .
[12137.03s -> 12139.03s]  .
[12139.03s -> 12141.03s]  .
[12141.03s -> 12143.03s]  .
[12143.03s -> 12147.59s]  take personally i would probably take heal in bronze uh just because i think you can take
[12147.59s -> 12156.73s]  advantage of lane phase really hard in bronze like bronze elo to me is like i should have reported
[12156.73s -> 12164.81s]  that guy i'm stupid bronze elo to me is like uh you can learn how to abuse people's lane phase
[12164.81s -> 12168.89s]  really hard because people will fight a lot in bronze right like they will take bad trades or
[12168.89s -> 12172.89s]  they will like try and fight because they don't know typically if you're bronze you probably don't
[12172.89s -> 12177.77s]  know like the champions very well and the damage stuff and stuff like that so what ends up happening
[12177.77s -> 12185.10s]  is like you probably just die a bunch or there are probably a lot of deaths in bronze so i would
[12185.10s -> 12191.42s]  say playing to like be able to help yourself early game with all the fighting going on is gonna have
[12191.42s -> 12198.62s]  a lot more value than ghost ghost is more of like a oh we hit mid game or a giant fight broke out
[12198.62s -> 12203.82s]  and i can like it's an extended long fight and i can get ghost utilization also ghost is really
[12203.82s -> 12208.46s]  valuable when you have good mechanical skill like ghost requires very good positioning typically
[12209.18s -> 12212.78s]  because you're repositioning a lot in the fight and that's why ghost is so good because you can
[12212.78s -> 12218.22s]  reposition back forward back forward back forward and you can essentially like uh space the enemy
[12218.22s -> 12229.03s]  and get free damage free boots too depends on the champion and the matchup like if i'm playing jinx
[12229.03s -> 12235.35s]  and i'm playing into like i don't know let's say i'm playing into like kaisa lulu okay you can take
[12235.35s -> 12240.31s]  free boots you don't need early boots in that matchup because it's an enchanter farm ad carry
[12240.31s -> 12245.27s]  versus an enchanter farm ad carrier okay now if i'm versus let's say i'm versus like a blitzcrank
[12245.27s -> 12249.67s]  let's say i'm playing jinx and i'm versus blitz like i typically don't want to have to wait till
[12249.67s -> 12255.59s]  nine minutes to get boots because blitzcrank's gonna shit on me so i will take different runes
[12255.59s -> 12261.51s]  versus that blitzcrank to allow myself the option of like let's say i have 1100 gold and i back i
[12261.51s -> 12266.47s]  I can get early boots and now the Blitzcrank has a much harder time.
[12266.47s -> 12274.63s]  Dude, I almost want to ban Zed because I don't want to get shit on by Stylish, but I think
[12274.63s -> 12275.63s]  it's cringe.
[12275.63s -> 12278.27s]  I don't want to like ban Stylish out.
[12278.27s -> 12298.44s]  How often does AD carry bot do you play parallel to your support?
[12298.44s -> 12301.51s]  You try to always.
[12301.51s -> 12306.51s]  Essentially, the perfect way to play bot lane is you're both hitting one target at the same
[12306.51s -> 12308.47s]  time, trading on one target at the same time.
[12308.47s -> 12311.95s]  You're making like a little triangle and you're both just like standing next to each other
[12311.95s -> 12317.31s]  and you're both hitting that one target right that's the best way to play bot lane but it's
[12317.31s -> 12323.18s]  very hard in solo queue obviously to do that but if you have like a duo you can practice it
[12324.38s -> 12330.62s]  sorry it went down the wrong pipe 80 karat tier list i shouldn't make one i have this thing where
[12331.50s -> 12338.46s]  even though i'm like grandmaster level i still think i suck i have this like really lack of
[12338.46s -> 12342.86s]  confidence because i i used to be challenger and now i'm like hard stack gm so like i have this
[12342.86s -> 12347.82s]  lack of confidence in what I'm talking about so like I feel like if I were to make a tier list
[12347.82s -> 12353.58s]  it would be based on like a GM player's skill and I don't know if like I don't want to get
[12353.58s -> 12376.74s]  ripped apart by people but I guess I could make a tier list from my own opinion like let me see
[12376.74s -> 12413.22s]  tier list maker I'm sure there's a tier list maker with champions right yeah there it is
[12414.34s -> 12425.57s]  wait this is terrible what is what are these pictures I'm just what what is this what is this
[12427.01s -> 12439.54s]  Why is Niko on here?
[12439.54s -> 12446.02s]  I want to use this one, but this one doesn't have Zary.
[12446.02s -> 12449.02s]  I'm trying to find one with Zary on it that doesn't look like shit.
[12449.02s -> 12454.02s]  It says this one has Zary, but it looks shitty. I don't enjoy that.
[12454.02s -> 12468.26s]  Hold on, we're going to play Ashe this game because they picked Xerath.
[12468.26s -> 12473.26s]  Like, I just saw them first pick Xerath, so I want something that can engage on the Xerath.
[12473.26s -> 12475.26s]  So we're going to go Ashe.
[12475.26s -> 12481.55s]  These are going to be my Ashe runes this game, boys.
[12481.55s -> 12490.31s]  Do I want to go Presence of Mind? I don't know.
[12490.31s -> 12493.11s]  I kind of do, but I kind of don't.
[12493.11s -> 12495.31s]  I think Presence of Mind kind of sucks.
[12495.31s -> 12500.89s]  It feels kind of shitty.
[12500.89s -> 12503.65s]  Hmm, we can just do Overheal.
[12503.65s -> 12507.42s]  We can go Alacrity.
[12507.42s -> 12509.12s]  I probably won't go Krakenslayer this game,
[12509.12s -> 12512.30s]  so we could probably just go Alacrity.
[12512.30s -> 12514.06s]  Even though Krakenslayer's not bad on Ashe,
[12514.06s -> 12522.38s]  I kind of want to go Bork Rush.
[12522.38s -> 12529.46s]  But I could go, I actually don't know what I want to take,
[12529.46s -> 12530.86s]  if I want to take Bloodline or Alacrity.
[12530.86s -> 12533.56s]  I'm gonna take Alacrity, we'll try it out.
[12533.56s -> 12536.48s]  And then we'll do Ghost, okay.
[12536.48s -> 12547.05s]  gonna say oh yeah yeah i need to find the right tier list i mean i can just use this right
[12548.65s -> 12563.61s]  i can't where's zary oh oh there we go yeah this is good okay i was like i was trying to figure it
[12563.61s -> 12569.68s]  out i was like what the fuck uh i think just straight out of the gate i was putting jinx in
[12569.68s -> 12577.84s]  s tier i think jinx is just an s tier champion she's crazy op like jinx just does what every
[12577.84s -> 12583.60s]  champion wants to do but like better than them she's blind pickable her two item three item spike
[12583.60s -> 12589.20s]  is crazy she's doesn't have a lot of like really bad matchups in lane phase anymore
[12590.00s -> 12596.48s]  they gave her scaling like crazy high like she's just good good build paths etc like she's just a
[12596.48s -> 12603.55s]  good champion uh i would say it's also hard to do tier list because you have to do tier list for
[12603.55s -> 12609.47s]  like low elo and high elo right because if i'm doing like a low elo tier list you're putting
[12609.47s -> 12615.63s]  mf like here right like mf super good but if you're doing a high elo tier list mf is like here
[12617.39s -> 12623.55s]  it's it's hard to explain and like in low elo i'm putting kalista here but in high elo i'm putting
[12623.55s -> 12633.55s]  her here so it's it's really interesting right because it's all based on like people's mechanical
[12633.55s -> 12640.91s]  skill too but yeah we can do the tier list between games i guess so far i think jinx is definitely
[12640.91s -> 12648.40s]  S tier. I wish there was like an S plus tier, but Jinx is definitely S tier. Draven's hard
[12648.40s -> 12652.88s]  to choose for me. Like I want to put him in A tier because he has a lot of counter matchups,
[12652.88s -> 12660.78s]  but in solo queue, Draven feels insane. So it's, it's hard. Cause I, I don't think Draven,
[12660.78s -> 12664.94s]  I think Draven's overrated personally because I know how to beat Draven players.
[12665.90s -> 12671.98s]  But I also think in high elo, when people also know how to deal with Draven players, the game,
[12671.98s -> 12676.57s]  I also do feel like
[12678.45s -> 12682.41s]  Good Draven players and good people who know how to play around Draven players make Draven OP
[12682.95s -> 12685.13s]  But it's also the opposite where good players
[12685.13s -> 12689.43s]  You know how to play around Draven can counter pick Draven and make him worthless. So it's it's really
[12690.49s -> 12706.57s]  It's really hard. All right, let me say
[12707.89s -> 12709.89s]  Morgana
[12709.93s -> 12714.78s]  Versus
[12714.82s -> 12716.82s]  Amumu
[12716.82s -> 12718.82s]  Imumu. Jhin players?
[12719.06s -> 12721.06s]  Jhin players are psychopaths, man.
[12722.94s -> 12726.78s]  I don't think Jhin's very good right now. I think he could be good if they gave him like a quality of life change.
[12726.90s -> 12737.91s]  Isn't he getting buffed next patch? I think he's getting buffed. I think he should do. Jhin's such a fun champ.
[12737.91s -> 12739.75s]  He's just like a little shitty.
[12739.75s -> 12752.38s]  We can actually just straight fight them right now if Imumu just Qs.
[12755.73s -> 12769.58s]  Because Morgana's worthless level one. Like I actually just straight up want to fight these guys right now. Go. Go go go.
[12769.58s -> 12782.57s]  Oh, he missed both his Q's.
[12783.49s -> 12788.35s]  Dude, this Amumu's killing me, man.
[12788.35s -> 12790.55s]  Oh my God, I, ah!
[12791.39s -> 12795.54s]  Bro, what am I watching?
[12795.54s -> 12797.36s]  What are these Q's, brother?
[12803.29s -> 12804.13s]  Holy shit!
[12806.27s -> 12808.17s]  All right, I should've taken long sword.
[12809.25s -> 12817.55s]  Amumu is not feeling himself today, let me tell you what.
[12817.55s -> 12834.85s]  He is not feeling himself.
[12834.85s -> 12836.17s]  Chase.
[12836.17s -> 12837.47s]  Even if Fez comes, chase.
[12838.53s -> 12846.13s]  Okay, we run.
[12846.13s -> 12847.41s]  I don't know if we can fight this.
[12847.41s -> 12848.31s]  We can try.
[12849.75s -> 12864.37s]  I'll volley.
[12864.37s -> 12872.44s]  Well, I mean, that guy should die.
[12872.44s -> 12874.36s]  Dude, I don't even know what's happening right now.
[12874.36s -> 12880.21s]  This is crazy.
[12880.21s -> 12882.27s]  This is ridiculous.
[12882.27s -> 12894.64s]  Both mid laners just got like three kills out of nowhere.
[12894.64s -> 12896.20s]  We went from like a ridiculously,
[12896.20s -> 12898.12s]  we went from like a Grandmaster game
[12898.12s -> 12900.12s]  to like a Diamond game.
[12900.12s -> 12904.07s]  Like somehow.
[12904.07s -> 12906.83s]  Like the Amumu's like, kinda whippin' some shit.
[12907.91s -> 12911.15s]  I took a bad trade early, then fuckin',
[12911.15s -> 12916.15s]  this shit is funny as fuck.
[12916.15s -> 12919.59s]  So I'm gonna actually rush tier two boots this game,
[12919.59s -> 12922.83s]  because I actually really, really, really
[12923.99s -> 12926.35s]  want to be mobile against their team.
[12926.35s -> 12927.79s]  Like, I'm just gonna straight up leave,
[12927.79s -> 12929.91s]  go buy T2 boots, and that's gonna be
[12929.91s -> 12933.75s]  my power spike for Ashe right now.
[12933.75s -> 12936.31s]  They have so many things that I can dodge on their team.
[12936.31s -> 12937.87s]  Like, look at this shit, right, like,
[12937.87s -> 12942.27s]  Morg binding, T2 boots, super easy to dodge if she can't flash it on me, right?
[12942.27s -> 12947.07s]  Like if she can't flash melee range, then Morg bind, it's- I should never get hit by it unless I have no fingers
[12947.87s -> 12949.87s]  Ezreal Q, easy to dodge
[12950.19s -> 12958.03s]  Xerath, easy to dodge. This guy, whatever the fuck, uh, Kha'zix, bug man. He's a melee champ. So boots have value, etc
[12963.07s -> 12966.91s]  Also, the cool thing about boots, uh, boots rush Ashe is she doesn't have damage
[12966.91s -> 12975.31s]  that if I'm good at spacing, like the better at spacing you are, you can actually just 1v2
[12976.59s -> 13006.99s]  especially against double skill shots like this. It's pretty fun. Fuck, if I duped that last Q,
[13006.99s -> 13011.79s]  I would have killed that guy. Dude, Xerath actually fucked us so bad though. That was
[13011.79s -> 13027.72s]  a good fight until Xerath just showed up and beat our ass. Yeah, just get the minion wave.
[13027.72s -> 13035.90s]  It's kind of funny to watch though, because I do so little damage, but I also like just
[13035.90s -> 13042.09s]  perma slow, so they can't do anything about it.
[13042.09s -> 13047.61s]  Hopefully when TF gets six, he can come bot and we can fuck over there, bot lane.
[13047.61s -> 13049.53s]  I'm hoping that that's the case.
[13049.53s -> 13059.04s]  Morgana roams mid, Kha'Zix is also mid, TF's dead.
[13059.04s -> 13064.48s]  That was a good roam.
[13064.48s -> 13074.17s]  I'm going to push this so that maybe we can play for a dragon, because they might go for
[13074.17s -> 13078.88s]  a dragon here and I think we can stop it.
[13078.88s -> 13084.44s]  we have TF ults.
[13084.44s -> 13088.48s]  Yup.
[13088.48s -> 13089.32s]  Nice.
[13089.32s -> 13090.66s]  We just leave.
[13090.66s -> 13092.38s]  We don't need to actually chase or do anything crazy.
[13092.38s -> 13093.38s]  We're just stopping the dragon.
[13093.38s -> 13094.46s]  That's all we're doing.
[13095.50s -> 13096.34s]  Right?
[13096.34s -> 13102.37s]  We don't want to give him a free drink.
[13102.37s -> 13103.99s]  See, the T2 boots are just broken.
[13103.99s -> 13111.99s]  They're broken as shit.
[13111.99s -> 13113.19s]  Cause you can just see, like I can,
[13113.19s -> 13115.11s]  I can pretty much just,
[13115.11s -> 13119.88s]  I'm just too fast for them to deal with.
[13119.88s -> 13120.72s]  Like, look at this.
[13120.72s -> 13121.54s]  It's, it's insane.
[13130.89s -> 13134.49s]  And that's why I value like the tier two boots on champions,
[13134.49s -> 13135.41s]  especially like Ashe,
[13135.41s -> 13138.17s]  where you can be extra egregious with it.
[13138.17s -> 13140.65s]  Cause like her slow,
[13140.65s -> 13141.47s]  imagine it's like, you know,
[13141.47s -> 13142.89s]  it's the same idea as Vayne, right?
[13142.89s -> 13144.65s]  When you think about it, it's like, okay,
[13144.65s -> 13148.33s]  so what's really annoying trying to run away from a Vayne,
[13148.33s -> 13149.17s]  right?
[13149.17s -> 13150.33s]  She gets boots too and you're like,
[13150.33s -> 13152.29s]  God damn it, man, she's so fast.
[13152.29s -> 13155.33s]  Same thing with Ashe, only now you're slow.
[13155.33s -> 13156.25s]  So it's even more annoying.
[13156.25s -> 13157.57s]  You try and go in on her,
[13157.57s -> 13159.45s]  she just spaces you, walks away a bit.
[13159.45s -> 13161.61s]  Now you're just sitting there waddling towards her slowly,
[13161.61s -> 13163.57s]  just upset, tilted, frustrated.
[13164.53s -> 13166.69s]  You know, it's like your middle school dance.
[13184.81s -> 13186.13s]  You know what?
[13189.30s -> 13191.30s]  I think this is actually a shield bow game.
[13192.62s -> 13193.62s]  It is.
[13193.98s -> 13196.84s]  I was gonna go Bork, but I think this is a shield bow game.
[13198.20s -> 13201.42s]  It could be a Galeforce game too, both are viable.
[13202.48s -> 13205.24s]  But uh, I actually, I might be one of the,
[13205.24s -> 13207.24s]  I might be in the minority here with this.
[13207.24s -> 13211.12s]  I think Bork rush on Ashe is actually good sometimes.
[13211.12s -> 13216.04s]  Like I think if I was versus some tanks like, you know, like a scion or something like that
[13216.04s -> 13218.34s]  I actually think Bork rush and ash is kind of cracked
[13219.50s -> 13223.98s]  Like yeah, it stalls out like you make the argument like it stalls out your three item or two item
[13224.28s -> 13226.48s]  But it's it feels kind of nuts
[13227.80s -> 13231.40s]  Also, this is a really OP thing that you can do. I should have hawk shot it sooner
[13231.40s -> 13236.28s]  I knew that they were doing rift, but I'm not paying attention as much as I should be
[13237.08s -> 13243.67s]  so
[13243.67s -> 13249.67s]  Because what you can do is you can hawk shot to tell your team where the enemy jungler is and get information yourself. I
[13253.52s -> 13255.52s]  Mean this Morgana's level 5
[13255.92s -> 13259.91s]  We could fight just because Morg is 5 right now
[13261.55s -> 13263.55s]  I kind of want to try
[13269.34s -> 13271.34s]  My Moo Moo didn't want to go in
[13271.44s -> 13272.74s]  my bad
[13272.74s -> 13277.53s]  I'm a little sad. I'm not gonna lie cuz I
[13277.97s -> 13282.11s]  Do feel like we win these fights, but a Moo Moo wants to wait for six
[13282.11s -> 13285.51s]  Which is fine, but like I said, you guys know me
[13285.51s -> 13288.39s]  I like to actually fight and be active in the lane early
[13288.95s -> 13294.27s]  Because I know that we can fight right and so it's like obviously, you know
[13303.53s -> 13305.53s]  This is really rough. I
[13306.19s -> 13309.56s]  Can't do anything
[13309.56s -> 13311.56s]  Cuz Xerath's here
[13312.52s -> 13317.38s]  TF's coming with ult though. I don't have ult. Goddammit if I had ult this would be so god tier
[13319.87s -> 13322.39s]  God, you have no idea how OP this would be if I had ulti man
[13323.47s -> 13327.48s]  Whatever, I'm bad.
[13327.48s -> 13329.48s]  I wanna push this wave out. I'm assuming they're all backing.
[13331.48s -> 13333.48s]  I think we penta there.
[13333.48s -> 13335.48s]  We even killed the top laner. Oh, I'm dead.
[13335.48s -> 13337.48s]  Why did I stay?
[13337.48s -> 13339.48s]  I knew
[13339.48s -> 13341.48s]  Kha'Zix would do that. I have to retrain
[13341.48s -> 13343.48s]  my brain. Kha'Zix players are rats.
[13343.48s -> 13345.48s]  And I have to retrain my brain to remember that they will
[13345.48s -> 13347.48s]  sit in a bush for 30 minutes, lose all
[13347.48s -> 13349.48s]  of their farm, to get one kill.
[13349.48s -> 13351.48s]  I like always forget that.
[13351.48s -> 13356.46s]  Like, Kha'Zix players are
[13356.46s -> 13358.46s]  absolute fucking rats
[13361.52s -> 13367.90s]  Like I respect Rengar players more than Kha'zix players. Yeah, I said it. I know hot take I know but I do
[13368.42s -> 13373.59s]  I'm gonna try an arrow right here
[13377.00s -> 13378.28s]  Got him
[13378.28s -> 13381.98s]  You know that guy's pissed by the way
[13383.22s -> 13392.12s]  God damn it. He's gonna try and ult me from the bush
[13393.32s -> 13397.20s]  You can always tell that you're about to get ulted when an Ezreal big big tip for you guys
[13397.32s -> 13401.36s]  If an Ezreal ever walks out of vision expect that he's ulting you
[13402.62s -> 13409.30s]  I you would not believe you would not believe the amount of people that I kill with Ezreal by simply walking into a bush and
[13409.30s -> 13411.66s]  Ulting them and they forget that I exist
[13412.66s -> 13415.18s]  I'm not I'm not even kidding. It happens so often
[13416.30s -> 13419.30s]  They're just like oh, yeah, he went in the bush. He's gonna hit his ult key
[13420.02s -> 13423.26s]  Like I it is comical how often it happens
[13423.90s -> 13425.90s]  And I'm sure you guys have died to it, too
[13427.14s -> 13431.46s]  Because it's like a thing where like you never see it. You barely you don't see Ezreal that often, right?
[13431.46s -> 13434.66s]  So because you probably don't see Ezreal too often. You're always like, oh
[13437.01s -> 13445.62s]  Interesting type shit. I'm gonna grab this plate and then I'm gonna back up
[13447.52s -> 13450.00s]  Kha'zix is coming down here. So I'm gonna back the fuck up
[13451.28s -> 13453.28s]  So I don't have arrow for 20
[13454.00s -> 13456.08s]  Ezreal has Triforce. We need to back up a bit
[13459.40s -> 13463.88s]  We might have to give dragon. I could see giving dragon being okay, though. It's not that bad
[13464.48s -> 13474.42s]  Yeah, it's not it's not the worst to give drake here. I
[13474.42s -> 13477.44s]  I can even back so we don't get dove
[13479.26s -> 13487.54s]  Like if we back now we might lose bot turret, but I can't walk up. Yeah, that's what I didn't want to have happen
[13488.42s -> 13492.43s]  see, that's
[13492.43s -> 13494.43s]  I'm telling you bad rats
[13495.35s -> 13500.55s]  absolute rats
[13500.55s -> 13504.55s]  Kha'zix players are rats man. Absolute literal rats. Oh
[13514.16s -> 13516.44s]  That's classy that's a good dodge I
[13523.70s -> 13525.70s]  Can't even walk up bot
[13525.70s -> 13528.48s]  I can wait for the turret, but I can't walk up
[13529.84s -> 13531.84s]  I'll just die
[13531.96s -> 13537.12s]  That's another thing you have to just accept like I'm down 40 CS this game because we've just been getting
[13537.76s -> 13539.76s]  weak sided and we've also been getting
[13541.76s -> 13543.76s]  Like a moomoos not very good I
[13545.00s -> 13548.20s]  Don't know I don't have a better way to say it. I don't have like a nice way to say it
[13548.20s -> 13550.20s]  He's not having a good game
[13551.16s -> 13553.94s]  And when your support doesn't have a good game, you don't have a good game early
[13553.94s -> 13561.32s]  So the best thing you can do is just try and farm up what you can don't die and scale for late
[13562.44s -> 13567.09s]  It's all you can really do as an ad carry when your support sucks
[13568.47s -> 13570.47s]  it feels really bad, but
[13571.77s -> 13584.79s]  Sometimes you just got to accept it right this Ezreal's not bad, but he's not good either. Oh
[13585.79s -> 13588.19s]  Yeah, this guy's gonna try and help me. I'm gonna kill rancher
[13589.07s -> 13606.09s]  Nice. I don't have all up yet guys
[13607.17s -> 13609.53s]  I don't have ult up yet. I can't ulti.
[13610.53s -> 13613.13s]  I have ult now, but we need to bait them in a bit.
[13615.64s -> 13617.84s]  I don't even want to use my ult right now to be honest with you.
[13618.96s -> 13620.96s]  Like I really don't.
[13621.88s -> 13625.80s]  You know what's funny? That Xerath's actually pretty good. I've played against him a few times in the past few seasons.
[13626.52s -> 13629.52s]  He's actually not bad. He used to be a support main.
[13630.88s -> 13636.93s]  Like he played Xerath support. That's why I recognize his name.
[13643.11s -> 13646.07s]  We should not go for this rift.
[13646.55s -> 13648.55s]  I'm on a bad timer for this
[13649.91s -> 13660.07s]  Because I'm really low HP and mana. Oh, I don't have mana
[13661.23s -> 13676.36s]  To arrow here guys. I do not want to arrow that because the the Fiora can totally the Fiora can do whatever it's called and
[13681.52s -> 13684.20s]  The Fiora can what's it? Whatever. It's called
[13685.08s -> 13687.52s]  W it if she's fast enough and I didn't wanna get my team killed
[13688.72s -> 13690.72s]  The real issue here is that we're forcing
[13691.44s -> 13693.44s]  Okay, I'll tell you exactly what the real issue is
[13693.44s -> 13697.76s]  We're forcing too many fights for no reason right now.
[13697.76s -> 13700.76s]  So like, we're all forcing tons of fights at the moment, right?
[13700.76s -> 13702.76s]  But there's no reason for us to force these fights.
[13704.76s -> 13706.76s]  That's why my team's getting tilted, right?
[13706.76s -> 13711.76s]  Like, for some reason, the Amumu and the TF are both just like inting.
[13711.76s -> 13715.76s]  And they're both getting frustrated, but we actually win the game if we play it slow.
[13717.76s -> 13720.76s]  Like, we can slow play this game out in scale, but it just takes time.
[13720.76s -> 13732.26s]  Cause I specifically picked Ashe so that we could, we had an answer for Xerath, cause
[13732.26s -> 13733.58s]  we have TF and Ashe, right?
[13733.58s -> 13735.82s]  So we have, we have a really good answer for him.
[13735.82s -> 13742.12s]  The problem is, um, we need to like stop tilting and just like understand that we can deal
[13742.12s -> 13743.12s]  with him later.
[13743.12s -> 13744.78s]  He's not like a, he's not like an A sole, right?
[13744.78s -> 13751.40s]  Like A sole is one of those champs that like you can't deal with.
[13751.40s -> 13755.14s]  Why did my Amumu wait to use ulti?
[13755.14s -> 13757.28s]  What?
[13757.28s -> 13760.34s]  He was in range.
[13760.34s -> 13761.34s]  I know he was.
[13761.34s -> 13768.58s]  Oh, nice.
[13768.58s -> 13771.46s]  Okay, we got a kill.
[13771.46s -> 13775.10s]  We need TF to play the game too, though.
[13775.10s -> 13780.96s]  Our TF is really tilted, so he's just sitting bot.
[13780.96s -> 13785.88s]  Amumu is extra tilted too, but I mean, I'll be honest, the Amumu is playing worse than
[13785.88s -> 13786.88s]  TF.
[13786.88s -> 13787.88s]  It's just that he's...
[13787.88s -> 13790.28s]  Dude, I hate when stuff happens like this.
[13790.28s -> 13791.92s]  Stop pinging the guy, man.
[13791.92s -> 13792.92s]  He's already frustrated.
[13792.92s -> 13795.88s]  You pinging him is not going to make him less frustrated.
[13795.88s -> 13806.70s]  gonna piss him off more like just play dude we have a really good uh team comp like we're behind
[13806.70s -> 13818.94s]  right now but we have a good team comp we should give this dragon by the way like a thousand percent
[13818.94s -> 13824.38s]  we don't have tfults like maybe maybe we could fight this but the morg's here so she can spell
[13824.38s -> 13831.90s]  from my arrow they got rift like we should give the drink we also have no vision control of this
[13831.90s -> 13837.82s]  area uh so this is another thing of like why you guys wonder like why i play uh support in this
[13837.82s -> 13843.02s]  elo like i get asked a lot like why are you a support main now i'm still an ad main but the
[13843.02s -> 13850.38s]  thing is it's really hard uh to play the game when your supports don't ward correctly we can
[13850.38s -> 13855.58s]  give this guys we can give it's not a huge deal nar's top we don't have to fight this guys we
[13855.58s -> 13865.72s]  don't have to fight this just back up yeah like this isn't a fight it's only second dragon it's
[13865.72s -> 13882.20s]  nothing. Wow I suck at CSing. But you see how little vision control we have on the map right
[13882.20s -> 13887.72s]  now? We have one ward here and that's about it. Vision control is, I say it's 90% of the game
[13887.72s -> 13891.72s]  in solo queue. That's why like I feel like supports are like the unsung hero. Like when
[13891.72s -> 13895.88s]  you get a support who knows how to properly throw out vision control, it feels insane.
[13902.46s -> 13908.06s]  We just gotta push. I do have hawkshot in a second, we can see if they're on this.
[13908.06s -> 13923.95s]  Okay, they're not I can volley we can back up Kha'zix is above me right now okay Kha'zix
[13923.95s -> 13930.91s]  wasted his ults that's not bad we should back I don't want to take this fight TF could ulti
[13930.91s -> 13936.67s]  but he's not right like this this is one of those moments where like I actually think we
[13936.67s -> 13941.91s]  actually could have killed two of them right there if TF ulted because they were out of
[13941.91s -> 13951.06s]  position really hard but again it's not like I think they're gonna walk I think
[13951.06s -> 13956.94s]  Cossacks is yeah he's somewhere up here I don't know where he is and I can't I
[13956.94s -> 13962.74s]  can't hawk shot I wasted my hawk shot for this dragon or this baron they could
[13962.74s -> 13967.80s]  be on baron we need to check but I have no hawk shots okay they're not they're
[13967.80s -> 13985.28s]  not we're chillin good I need a hundred golds yeah I'm aware I'm getting ganked
[13985.28s -> 14003.51s]  I'm fully fucking aware trust me I'm just trying to force them to make a
[14003.51s -> 14019.44s]  choice probably wasn't a great use of my ghost but i say we bail i need to go get my item
[14021.92s -> 14038.29s]  ezreal's just pushing aside somehow uncontested over there somebody just tp'd bot what what the
[14038.29s -> 14044.45s]  fuck is this amumu doing what is my team doing what are you guys doing this is so awkward man
[14053.40s -> 14063.40s]  i mean guys guys kill kill the kha'zix oh thank god i don't know why kha'zix just dove to kill
[14063.40s -> 14069.64s]  me of all people my man just like wanted me dead he was like yeah fuck that ad carry guy
[14070.84s -> 14083.27s]  like okay sure fuck me what do i want i feel like i need damage but i don't know what gives me the
[14083.27s -> 14098.82s]  highest damage here maybe just i don't know maybe just pd i'm not actually sure ie would be good
[14098.82s -> 14103.78s]  But it doesn't give me like more it gives me like I use interesting in this position
[14105.48s -> 14108.04s]  Like I almost want more movement speed from the like PD
[14109.08s -> 14113.68s]  Even though normally like the utilities better like maybe BT is still the best and I'm just trolling
[14114.24s -> 14126.04s]  We can just do dragon right now. They have no TP or Baron. I think we totally actually could do this
[14127.10s -> 14134.24s]  I'm down to try if you if you want to Rengar, they got two people bought they're setting up for dragon vision right now
[14134.24s -> 14137.86s]  I'm actually kind of down to just try and play for Baron here
[14144.75s -> 14149.29s]  Like we could bait Baron here and force them to walk into us with my arrow I
[14177.26s -> 14179.82s]  Want to stay together because I don't know where the Cossacks is
[14182.47s -> 14198.92s]  Found him. What is my mumu doing? Dude? He has smite like I pull it out if you're gonna do this, right like
[14199.84s -> 14220.48s]  I'll use your brain man. All right. Now we do Baron though. We have to we have to do Baron
[14220.48s -> 14228.80s]  This is like one of the worst players I've ever seen this Amumu. He has no clue what he's doing by the way
[14229.88s -> 14238.97s]  Like he's so dumb. He's he's like flaming the TF. He's in his mind
[14238.97s -> 14242.41s]  He's so angry at this TF that he's ignoring every single thing that's going on
[14243.09s -> 14246.89s]  like he's ignoring that like the dragon was a bad call to begin with and
[14247.49s -> 14251.89s]  If we are gonna do that dragon, we have to zone the fucking jungler because he has fucking
[14253.17s -> 14255.17s]  smite right so it's like
[14255.17s -> 14258.93s]  Like what are you talking about, man?
[14258.93s -> 14261.11s]  These players are crazy.
[14261.11s -> 14263.77s]  It just feels to me like they're so angry at everything.
[14263.77s -> 14264.77s]  It's kind of funny.
[14264.77s -> 14267.92s]  Okay, I got three items now.
[14267.92s -> 14272.48s]  I went for the PD because I kind of think the extra movement speed and the extra, uh,
[14272.48s -> 14275.77s]  it'll help a lot.
[14275.77s -> 14279.05s]  I will say both the junglers are playing really well.
[14279.05s -> 14283.09s]  This game is like, interesting.
[14283.09s -> 14285.13s]  Like both the assassin junglers are playing pretty well.
[14285.13s -> 14287.01s]  The enemy Xerath's playing pretty decent.
[14287.01s -> 14299.66s]  Uh, what that is not a I I mean that was embarrassing like I don't even have words for that
[14301.44s -> 14303.82s]  Like I genuinely don't have words for that shit I
[14306.18s -> 14311.80s]  missed I
[14311.80s -> 14314.12s]  Can't see we have no vision man
[14320.69s -> 14322.69s]  Like we have no vision
[14323.43s -> 14326.19s]  Nothing's warded because the moomoo didn't put any wards down
[14326.19s -> 14334.63s]  So I can't fight because literally we're standing there in this area and there's nothing warded
[14335.13s -> 14343.64s]  The best part is all Amumu had to do was not die before that fight and we auto win
[14344.06s -> 14346.06s]  Like we were winning so hard
[14346.32s -> 14349.92s]  But this Amumu is actually solo losing us the game with his fucking ego
[14350.76s -> 14353.14s]  God support players are so bad at League
[14356.00s -> 14357.72s]  Actually
[14357.72s -> 14365.99s]  And they'll deflect support players will will lie to themselves about how good they are and tell them that it's always their team's fault
[14366.15s -> 14373.27s]  But they'll drop nine deaths have nine KP in a fucking 23 kill game and then blame their fucking team
[14374.75s -> 14376.75s]  It's crazy
[14384.46s -> 14395.22s]  Please ward things man. Oh my god
[14396.14s -> 14404.09s]  He's dead again
[14404.09s -> 14406.41s]  Guys, why are we up here top?
[14407.13s -> 14409.13s]  Why are we top guys?
[14409.13s -> 14416.79s]  Why are we three-manning top right now?
[14418.19s -> 14420.19s]  Holy crap
[14420.95s -> 14422.95s]  My teammates are absolute apes
[14423.91s -> 14425.91s]  Like what am I watching men?
[14427.94s -> 14433.66s]  They just three man's top. Oh my god
[14437.90s -> 14440.14s]  Like these are the worst players I've ever fucking seen
[14441.54s -> 14446.54s]  Like we had the game in our hands and then all of a sudden my team's like, you know what?
[14446.54s -> 14450.16s]  I don't actually want to win and I'm like why and they're like, well you see
[14451.54s -> 14455.46s]  I have an ego, and you're like, oh, I see.
[14455.46s -> 14458.82s]  This is why I can't play AD carry in this ELO, I'm sorry.
[14458.82s -> 14459.66s]  I can't.
[14459.66s -> 14460.90s]  I have to play support in this ELO
[14460.90s -> 14463.14s]  because AD carry's actually not playable
[14465.14s -> 14469.52s]  when the entire game is decided by jungle, support, and mid.
[14470.62s -> 14473.62s]  AD carry does not decide any of the League of Legends games
[14473.62s -> 14475.02s]  below Grandmaster.
[14475.02s -> 14475.84s]  Not one of them.
[14475.84s -> 14478.38s]  Like last game, we popped off and we won
[14478.38s -> 14480.72s]  because we were the better AD carry, right?
[14480.72s -> 14486.96s]  This game, it doesn't matter, because TF does 11k damage, does an ulti bot more than one time,
[14487.68s -> 14497.14s]  like Rengar did well, Gnar did well, but they also had a horrible macro. Like, it is insane to me
[14497.14s -> 14501.54s]  how easy support is as a role, and just how dogshit every support player is on the server.
[14502.50s -> 14508.58s]  Like, your role requires zero thought. Your thought when playing support is,
[14508.58s -> 14516.26s]  is, do I get vision or not? If no, where can I be the most useful? Your thought should
[14516.26s -> 14529.19s]  never be, this game's over, my team sucks. It drives me ludicrous. I'm sorry that I have
[14529.19s -> 14533.87s]  to play support on this account to climb, but it's crazy how dogshit adc is when you're
[14533.87s -> 14540.71s]  solo queuing in masters. In GM, if it's a full GM game, adc is easy as fuck. If everybody
[14540.71s -> 14545.67s]  has a brain activity and they're not idiots, ad carry is amazing. Favorite role in the game.
[14545.67s -> 14549.27s]  When you're playing with people who don't know what they're doing and you're actively trying
[14549.27s -> 14554.71s]  to climb and improve, it genuinely feels like I'm pulling out a ball hair with my tweezers,
[14554.71s -> 14565.11s]  or pulling out my ball hairs with tweezers, like one by one. It is so painful. It's crazy.
[14568.68s -> 14574.68s]  Like, let's take a look at this, this support main right now. 97 LP, negative win rate, right?
[14574.68s -> 14582.20s]  I could I could literally tell that he was not a good player in the first 30 seconds of that game
[14582.48s -> 14589.85s]  I'm sorry. I'm being mean but dude, this has been driving me crazy
[14590.59s -> 14600.34s]  Like look at the way the support I had last game. Also, can I ask a question? Why am I even allowed?
[14601.10s -> 14608.78s]  Why am I even allowed to be in games with a challenger support one game? I win the game
[14609.58s -> 14610.94s]  then
[14610.94s -> 14614.06s]  Immediately it puts me in a game with a 97 LP
[14615.30s -> 14620.56s]  master support
[14620.56s -> 14622.56s]  What is this matchmaking?
[14622.76s -> 14629.47s]  This is insane
[14634.23s -> 14661.00s]  That's crazy. I I don't even I'm wondering why
[14661.72s -> 14668.17s]  So I'm gonna go on a rant for a second. Why is this allowed?
[14668.85s -> 14672.97s]  Why can you be in a game? Why can I be in a game with a literal guy?
[14672.97s -> 14674.97s]  Who's about to promote to challenger?
[14674.97s -> 14681.77s]  right? we win the game and then the very next game it puts me in a game with a guy who's 97 LP
[14684.80s -> 14702.41s]  this is insane sorry that's just frustrating as fuck
[14704.09s -> 14711.82s]  because it's like such bad game design right like that's that's 900 LP difference
[14718.04s -> 14724.12s]  and the thing is this guy doesn't have good MMR right like like it's not it's not like this guy
[14724.12s -> 14732.36s]  has good mmr right because look at his games he's playing with all masters players they're all like
[14732.36s -> 14739.48s]  100 lp masters 70 lp 30 lp right it doesn't make sense he it's not like his mmr is high
[14740.12s -> 14747.16s]  so why is this guy getting into like a 600 lp grandmaster game why are we putting that guy in
[14747.16s -> 14758.08s]  the game that's so frustrating sorry i just i needed the vent how do you know which ad carry
[14758.08s -> 14765.04s]  pick in each situation uh it's a lot of knowledge a lot of knowledge like you have to know
[14766.88s -> 14772.88s]  a lot of shit like what the enemy champions do what your champions need to do to win the game
[14772.88s -> 14778.80s]  what the win cons are you can just pick if i'm being honest though you could just pick uh
[14781.44s -> 14784.96s]  like there are 80 carries in the current meta where you can just pick that are blind like i
[14784.96s -> 14789.44s]  was making a tier list i forgot about it but i mean you can blind pick jinx pretty much every
[14789.44s -> 14796.88s]  game like jinx is just blindable every game pretty much she's insane she's super op so like if you if
[14796.88s -> 14800.16s]  you ever just want to play a champion and you think like okay i want to practice ad like jinx
[14800.16s -> 14809.23s]  is insane super good um draven's not blindable but i do think he's really good if you're good
[14809.23s -> 14815.15s]  at the game draven's very good he's he's he's harder than jinx by a mile like draven's a lot
[14815.15s -> 14822.84s]  harder but he's definitely like good at carrying with a lead as well like another blindable ad
[14822.84s -> 14828.04s]  that i think is like a tier is like varus you can blind pick varus really easily because varus
[14828.04s -> 14834.12s]  doesn't really have counters like he doesn't get countered by anything he's more of like a
[14834.12s -> 14840.12s]  you can pick him and then go even and your ulti will always be useful you can look to like win
[14840.12s -> 14871.45s]  lane you can look to like engage things like that right uh okay so this game uh as the support i
[14871.45s -> 14878.91s]  need to be tracking the jungler so i'm gonna think where always be thinking what the enemy jungler
[14878.91s -> 14882.83s]  wants to accomplish and how to stop it that's like a pretty big tip of advice that i can give you
[14882.83s -> 14888.19s]  guys like think to yourself like okay if i was the enemy jungler what would i be wanting to do
[14888.19s -> 14893.71s]  against the scrams right as lee sin he's probably gonna want to either gank early like gank bot
[14893.71s -> 14900.83s]  early or he wants to invade on certain timers right because that's like what Lee is really good
[14900.83s -> 14909.39s]  at is ganking and invading so what I think I'm gonna try to do this game is I'm gonna try and
[14910.35s -> 14914.43s]  watch for early ganks and early pressure bot lane like your level 2 level 3 ganks
[14915.31s -> 14920.43s]  we're still gonna be aggressive but Lux took tp which means this Lux does not plan on playing
[14920.43s -> 14927.07s]  aggressive at all like she basically if anybody takes tp like this in a lane i already know from
[14927.07s -> 14931.31s]  start of the game that they're not planning on doing anything so i'm probably gonna end up roaming
[14931.31s -> 14949.90s]  a lot this game this is a this is gonna be a game where i roam a ton uh we do have some good lanes
[14949.90s -> 14968.78s]  to roam to too like roaming top and mid is both really good i just want her to ward early because
[14968.78s -> 14976.86s]  uh i don't want to get shit on by lee so okay i'm just gonna flash immediately there's no reason
[14976.86s -> 14981.10s]  There's no reason to not flash there because Alistar used his flash to get my flash, which
[14981.10s -> 14982.56s]  is totally fine.
[14982.56s -> 14992.20s]  It's better for him because he has Hex flash, but it's not that bad because I can outrange
[14992.20s -> 14997.88s]  him and I can stay away from his shit.
[14997.88s -> 14998.88s]  So we know he's in the bush.
[14998.88s -> 15000.64s]  We just chill.
[15000.64s -> 15001.64s]  There it is.
[15001.64s -> 15002.64s]  He fucked up.
[15002.64s -> 15003.64s]  Now we go forward.
[15003.64s -> 15007.24s]  I don't know why Lux isn't throwing spells at this guy.
[15007.24s -> 15009.96s]  I don't know why she didn't Q him.
[15009.96s -> 15010.96s]  He fucked up.
[15010.96s -> 15016.80s]  should have died there and she's pinging me okay the alistar should have died there if alistar ever
[15016.80s -> 15021.68s]  fucks up an engage like that where he hex flashes in gets stuck like q is cool down yeah i don't
[15021.68s -> 15025.84s]  know why it was thrown that's what i'm saying you don't throw you don't throw spells that uh
[15026.56s -> 15032.80s]  that aren't gonna land so there's no point in lux ever throwing her q until alistar fucks up the
[15032.80s -> 15038.48s]  combo like she should just poke with e and then um because it's almost like a blitz hook right
[15038.48s -> 15040.48s]  Think of it like a Blitz hook.
[15040.48s -> 15045.48s]  If she throws the Q out, now they have an opportunity to be aggressive because they
[15045.48s -> 15049.14s]  know the hook is down.
[15049.14s -> 15053.96s]  So it's better for her to just hold the hook, essentially, right?
[15053.96s -> 15059.88s]  Hold the Q, and now when Alistar does go in, they have to be nervous about that Q because
[15059.88s -> 15063.00s]  they can't just think, oh the Q's down, let's engage, right?
[15063.00s -> 15064.64s]  So they can't actually think about that.
[15064.64s -> 15077.37s]  This is why I don't like, uh, a lot of the time doing this, like, push, push the wave.
[15077.37s -> 15085.37s]  They can't engage on us without, like, flashing, so it doesn't matter, like, look.
[15085.37s -> 15090.43s]  Did she Q the wave again, or am I an idiot?
[15090.43s -> 15093.15s]  Like just, oh man, I'm losing my mind here.
[15093.15s -> 15095.83s]  Oh, these, I'm tilting.
[15095.83s -> 15096.83s]  It's fine.
[15096.83s -> 15100.87s]  I need to not tilt, I need to just chill, but I'm getting frustrated because we're, like,
[15100.87s -> 15103.95s]  Using cooldowns properly and it's driving me fucking crazy
[15107.58s -> 15111.34s]  Because these are very simple things to do you guys got to walk the wave in by the way
[15111.34s -> 15114.42s]  You can't let them freeze. Okay, they're very simple things to do
[15114.42s -> 15116.30s]  I know I'm being annoying as shit whining about this
[15116.30s -> 15121.66s]  But this is stuff that you you need to be thinking about when you're playing the game. Well, you should actively be thinking
[15123.96s -> 15128.70s]  What can I do with my champions toolkit to stop their champions toolkit and
[15129.26s -> 15131.78s]  You should be thinking. Okay. I have Q right?
[15131.78s -> 15138.12s]  So what do they want to do? They want to go in. Okay, and when you're thinking they want to go in
[15140.98s -> 15146.66s]  Right, you should be thinking. Okay when they go in I can just queue and that should be your entire thought process
[15147.50s -> 15149.50s]  Your thought process should never be. Oh
[15150.86s -> 15158.78s]  Maybe I can land a random queue at max range and we can get a kill. She queued the wave. Yes, that's what I mean like
[15159.62s -> 15163.56s]  You should never queue the wave on Lux either unless you're going to 100% reset
[15163.56s -> 15169.06s]  That would be like if I hooked the wave as like Blitzcrank or some shit.
[15169.06s -> 15172.06s]  Why is my Lux bait-pinging my graves?
[15172.06s -> 15177.94s]  Dude, I gotta keep this 100% honest with you man.
[15177.94s -> 15182.94s]  You don't get to be mad here.
[15182.94s -> 15187.72s]  These players are such babies.
[15187.72s -> 15189.82s]  Jesus Christ, what pussies man.
[15189.82s -> 15194.03s]  These people are such babies.
[15194.03s -> 15197.91s]  The graves played correctly by the way, like 100%.
[15197.91s -> 15200.21s]  He's mad at the Graves for taking a wave.
[15200.21s -> 15203.73s]  He wanted to not like he wanted to be able to TP back and get the wave.
[15203.73s -> 15208.77s]  That's what this Lux is so trash that she actually believes that the Graves fault that
[15208.77s -> 15214.81s]  Graves misplayed by pushing the bot wave, but it was the right play.
[15214.81s -> 15218.57s]  Pushing the bot wave was the correct play there, because then she doesn't have to TP.
[15218.57s -> 15222.33s]  The whole reason that he's pushing it is to save her teleport so that she doesn't have
[15222.33s -> 15227.94s]  to TP to lane.
[15227.94s -> 15232.22s]  like this are why the game is hard to play right now in the current meta. Why it feels
[15232.22s -> 15237.34s]  bad. Because this Lux is trash. You guys can all see this Lux is terrible. She's already
[15237.34s -> 15244.30s]  made a bunch of mistakes, she's blaming her team, she's being a dipshit, right? But, she
[15244.30s -> 15268.65s]  can climb up to this elo being this bad because of the system, the current system in place.
[15268.65s -> 15276.91s]  We should immediately do Baron here, Dragon I mean. We should do this. Come. You don't
[15276.91s -> 15281.79s]  have time for this just come do dragon bro the lee sin just showed top we should be
[15281.79s -> 15301.64s]  doing dragon when um when this shit happens by the way where you have um enemy jungler
[15301.64s -> 15306.48s]  shows on one side of the map you should always be playing on the other side of the map to
[15306.48s -> 15318.84s]  make a counter play so jungler shows on top side we go for dragon right easy yo be careful
[15318.84s -> 15321.24s]  Alistar's going to be there, Xerath's going to be there, just leave.
[15322.04s -> 15323.04s]  Just leave, leave, leave, leave.
[15325.31s -> 15327.31s]  I'll do it for you, I'll make you leave, I got you, man.
[15330.06s -> 15333.66s]  But we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and, um...
[15334.16s -> 15336.86s]  I need to back now, but we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back.
[15337.86s -> 15339.86s]  And not only did their bot lane have to back, but...
[15341.66s -> 15342.76s]  The enemy was top.
[15348.42s -> 15350.82s]  I tried, man, I tried to flash Q him.
[15354.64s -> 15357.64s]  But yeah, it's really... I don't know, a lot of junglers don't...
[15357.64s -> 15359.84s]  I don't think they know what their... Oh, I'm dead, by the way.
[15360.24s -> 15362.80s]  I'm not even gonna pop exhaust. I'm just dead.
[15363.92s -> 15368.32s]  A lot of junglers don't know what the goal of the game actually is.
[15368.32s -> 15369.28s]  A lot of them think it's-
[15369.28s -> 15370.96s]  I think that was a bad insect, but...
[15370.96s -> 15375.92s]  A lot of junglers think the goal of the game is to, like, get as much farm as you can and run over the enemy team and shit.
[15375.92s -> 15377.12s]  But it's actually- It is.
[15377.12s -> 15383.52s]  But it's also about, like, getting early objectives and turning those small leads into big leads through objective control.
[15384.08s -> 15384.72s]  Right?
[15386.48s -> 15388.80s]  So, like, right now, I want to rotate top.
[15388.80s -> 15391.66s]  Rift is up. I know Lee Sin's gonna be on top side of the map right now
[15391.66s -> 15393.60s]  I want to rotate top
[15393.60s -> 15399.06s]  So that I can help my team by being in the top side of the map because that's where the next play is gonna be
[15399.06s -> 15414.06s]  Made well the plays made mid, but I mean I'm here so it's fine. Oh my god
[15414.06s -> 15422.72s]  I did not think the fucking Lee Sin would be there, too.
[15424.40s -> 15425.44s]  Oops
[15425.44s -> 15431.22s]  This is rough. I don't really know how to
[15431.80s -> 15435.08s]  How to play this because I got there in time to counter the gank
[15435.08s -> 15441.24s]  Right? I exhausted the guy, saved the Xerath. I got there in time to counter the gank, but
[15441.24s -> 15455.19s]  ooh, well played. That was actually mega well played. That was really good. I want to push
[15455.19s -> 15468.60s]  this wave in, but I can't. Like, you guys are noticing there's no objectives taken on
[15468.60s -> 15473.76s]  the map yet at 10 minutes, which is kind of crazy. The ally's doing really good. The allyster's
[15473.76s -> 15494.28s]  not a bad support player he's playing well like he's playing very well a lot
[15494.28s -> 15498.08s]  of this is more of like I need I don't have anything to do on the map because
[15498.08s -> 15504.36s]  I'm trying to help my jungler but my jungler is trolling it's really rough
[15504.36s -> 15507.68s]  because like I'm trying to rotate over and help my jungler on cooldown
[15507.68s -> 15512.04s]  basically right but my jungler doesn't want to fight you see like I'm countering
[15512.04s -> 15522.11s]  the Alistar's fight, or ganks, it's just, I'm just dead.
[15524.60s -> 15525.44s]  Dude.
[15527.36s -> 15529.62s]  Like, we shouldn't have made that play mid,
[15529.62s -> 15531.42s]  because we knew that they were all there,
[15531.42s -> 15533.88s]  and we knew that our jungler's doing this.
[15535.08s -> 15537.28s]  This might just be a jungle diff, honestly.
[15539.04s -> 15540.08s]  Like, our AD carry sucks,
[15540.08s -> 15542.14s]  but it might just be a straight up jungle diff game.
[15542.14s -> 15543.02s]  They do happen.
[15544.88s -> 15545.76s]  Especially in this elo,
[15545.76s -> 15547.76s]  where jungle has so much control of the game,
[15547.76s -> 15553.22s]  they do happen.
[15553.22s -> 15555.94s]  It's a pretty big jungle diff, Chipoppy, you know it, I know it
[15557.78s -> 15561.08s]  Like yeah, he's saying yeah, but he knows the jungle is getting out outclassed
[15561.94s -> 15565.89s]  insanely hard
[15565.89s -> 15568.77s]  Because graves counters Lee Sin. It's a massive counter
[15571.59s -> 15573.59s]  But this guy doesn't know what he's doing
[15575.67s -> 15578.07s]  I think he's a Rengar one trick and Rengar got banned
[15578.79s -> 15580.79s]  I think that's what's going on
[15581.27s -> 15587.67s]  It's a Rengar one trick who got banned out and he tried to play a champion that requires thought not just a I jump you die
[15587.67s -> 15599.06s]  champ right and he just gets shit on for it i mean dude i can't even i can't even do anything this
[15599.06s -> 15609.65s]  game our top lander is getting his ass whipped too it's really fucking rough i mean he's in here
[15609.65s -> 15615.65s]  i'm pretty sure it's not it was just it was warded though i mean we can't really do anything
[15615.65s -> 15623.41s]  here i'm i'm dead i think yeah i'm just dead this is just rough i i i kind of want to go next because
[15623.41s -> 15626.65s]  because I don't think, I don't think we have the skill
[15626.65s -> 15627.81s]  on the team to win.
[15629.65s -> 15631.77s]  The jungle diff is huge, the AD diff is huge,
[15631.77s -> 15648.36s]  and I'm just, I can't, I can't impact the map.
[15648.36s -> 15650.08s]  Like I can't, I just can't do anything this game
[15650.08s -> 15662.53s]  to impact the map, and it feels really bad.
[15662.53s -> 15668.00s]  Oh, son of a bitch, I should've flashed.
[15668.00s -> 15669.76s]  I got like creep blocked a little bit when he knocked me in,
[15669.76s -> 15671.40s]  I like had to walk through, I should've just flashed up.
[15671.40s -> 15672.52s]  That's my bad.
[15672.52s -> 15674.08s]  Like what was that TP, man?
[15674.08s -> 15676.56s]  Oh God, get me out.
[15676.56s -> 15678.24s]  I'm gonna be 100% real, get me out.
[15678.24s -> 15680.56s]  That TP was miserably bad.
[15680.56s -> 15682.52s]  Dude just TP'd to the wave.
[15691.10s -> 15692.66s]  Like what is our Lux doing too?
[15694.14s -> 15696.54s]  I just feel like everybody's late to the fights.
[15697.90s -> 15700.46s]  Lux is always late to the fights.
[15700.46s -> 15702.30s]  The Graves doesn't wanna take fights
[15702.30s -> 15705.02s]  even though he's playing Graves into Lee Sin.
[15705.02s -> 15707.06s]  Like I feel like, ooh, this is rough.
[15707.06s -> 15708.86s]  This is a rough game.
[15708.86s -> 15711.78s]  Games like this tilt me and I kinda just wanna go next.
[15711.78s -> 15713.78s]  Cause games like this, they are winnable
[15713.78s -> 15717.02s]  but I feel like I want to go next to save mental, you know?
[15717.02s -> 15729.22s]  Like low key, I just want to save my mental.
[15729.22s -> 15731.38s]  Cause, oh, it's so gross.
[15732.74s -> 15734.98s]  Like watching what Lux did in the early stages
[15734.98s -> 15737.38s]  of the lane phase, just wasting her Q on repeat.
[15737.38s -> 15739.46s]  That was one of the most embarrassing things ever.
[15739.46s -> 15740.78s]  And then like, look at that.
[15740.78s -> 15742.02s]  She just Q'd a minion.
[15753.58s -> 15758.11s]  Ooh, bro.
[15758.11s -> 15759.43s]  Oh my God.
[15759.43s -> 15764.43s]  You gotta push the wave, man.
[15764.43s -> 15765.53s]  Holy shits.
[15768.78s -> 15776.44s]  I mean, I can't even walk.
[15776.44s -> 15784.04s]  My god, I don't even have help from my fucking team that's the worst part about this
[15788.68s -> 15791.72s]  Dude these games feel so unplayable man
[15793.72s -> 15797.24s]  Like I don't know how else to say it except for they just feel miserable to play
[15800.24s -> 15806.08s]  like i'm trying to focus on playing like improving myself, but it's so hard to know how to improve in games where like
[15806.08s -> 15816.89s]  Like, you genuinely just get no help.
[15816.89s -> 15820.33s]  My Lux has been tilted since like minute two for some reason.
[15820.33s -> 15825.21s]  And my graves has been completely pathing wrong, doing wrong shit.
[15825.21s -> 15826.25s]  It's hard to know how to help.
[15826.25s -> 15830.17s]  Like I went mid to help, countered two of the early ganks.
[15830.17s -> 15833.80s]  Lux still griefed the game.
[15833.80s -> 15835.58s]  So like, yeah, it's just, it's hard to know.
[15835.58s -> 15840.26s]  And then top lane lost.
[15840.26s -> 15846.33s]  It's so rough, man.
[15846.33s -> 15851.71s]  I'm gonna keep it a hundred percent honest with you. If you are a one trick do not try and play other champs
[15853.17s -> 15863.00s]  You you will int you will play badly always and you will int and you will you will
[15863.36s -> 15865.36s]  Like look at this. This is
[15865.76s -> 15867.68s]  2.9k damage as a
[15867.68s -> 15875.46s]  Dude, like what are we doing? How are these people getting into this elo?
[15876.28s -> 15884.12s]  How does this Lux like in the game? She was against an Alistar bot and she did one point
[15884.88s -> 15890.40s]  2.9k damage in a 16 minute game against a melee heavy team
[15892.00s -> 15894.00s]  Like what is this what is happening
[15895.12s -> 15897.04s]  This guy was d4
[15897.04s -> 15899.04s]  30 lp last season
[15901.39s -> 15903.39s]  And now he's magically in masters
[15908.17s -> 15910.17s]  No, we need to fix matchmaking
[15910.41s -> 15917.12s]  This is this is insane
[15917.12s -> 15919.44s]  Like this is just a matchmaking diff. It's nothing else
[15920.64s -> 15922.56s]  my man literally
[15922.56s -> 15928.96s]  does not belong in master tier 400 lp mmr at all well you can see that he's not at this level
[15943.90s -> 15958.03s]  dude i have the lux player on my team again oh this is xerath one trick and a rengar one trick
[15958.03s -> 15966.43s]  on the enemy team i don't know man i guess i care more about the rengar than the xerath but
[15969.80s -> 15987.47s]  this is rough oh what's up chupapi dude sorry i hit yes on that man i know the game was winnable
[15987.47s -> 15992.43s]  I'm gonna be real, but dude, you didn't see what I saw during the early game of that game, Chibabi.
[15993.07s -> 16003.90s]  Like man, the entire early game of that game was like, we lost lane because Lux wouldn't use her Q
[16004.62s -> 16011.26s]  to fight the Alistar, she was using it to farm minions. Like she was so scared of being engaged
[16011.26s -> 16016.70s]  on by the Alistar and the Kalista, that she would use her Q to max range farm minions
[16016.70s -> 16020.86s]  instead of save it, so when the Alistar engages, we just kill him.
[16022.54s -> 16025.82s]  Right? Because if Alistar ever engages on me and Lux, he just gets killed.
[16026.38s -> 16029.34s]  We just bind him, walk away, and he's stuck there, and he dies, right?
[16030.06s -> 16036.46s]  But for some reason, she didn't understand how to do that, so she was just throwing it to farm,
[16036.46s -> 16041.10s]  so we would just get engaged on. So I started roaming, and every time I was, like, roaming to
[16041.10s -> 16046.94s]  an objective or something, the graves would always walk away and not fight. Like, he wasn't attempting
[16046.94s -> 16051.10s]  to fight he was basically just like oh i'm gonna go farm some more but i'm like dude you can't do
[16051.10s -> 16055.34s]  that like if the alistar is ganking mid and i'm countering mid you can't just farm farm before
[16055.34s -> 16059.90s]  coming mid or you can't just like not take dragon and shit like that right like it blows my mind
[16059.90s -> 16063.98s]  that these players can get like it's like this guy too same thing like that jungler last game
[16063.98s -> 16069.02s]  right look at this it's the same thing as the last game like na is riddled with this shit and it's
[16069.02s -> 16074.06s]  it's so miserable to play look at this this jungler last game right he's not he's what like a d1
[16074.06s -> 16078.78s]  player right he's not a bad player he peaks d1 but why is this guy in this game now he like
[16078.78s -> 16083.90s]  artificially inflated to this elo getting lucky with his first few games and now we have to play
[16083.90s -> 16093.21s]  with this guy oh it's an account share the person it's a different player look on the account
[16094.89s -> 16104.25s]  d flash f flash so uh it's just it's a fucking account share that's that's frustrating
[16104.25s -> 16115.04s]  Sorry for whining so much guys. This shit's just really frustrating to me
[16116.40s -> 16123.06s]  Like I know I should play it to like specifically only care about like improving and then while you're improving you'll climb automatically and shit
[16123.36s -> 16125.36s]  but it's really frustrating when like
[16127.08s -> 16131.34s]  The players in the game would rather be idiots and assholes to each other than play the game
[16131.56s -> 16137.48s]  Right like the game before the Amumu right the game before this the Amumu was just being toxic the whole game and into the win
[16137.48s -> 16142.00s]  away. The last game, the Lux and the Graves were being toxic to each other the whole game.
[16142.00s -> 16148.92s]  We inted the game away. It's like, it's not fun to lose because one player gets mad at
[16148.92s -> 16158.85s]  another player over them both being idiots. I'm sorry, it's not fun. It's so unfun. But
[16158.85s -> 16175.82s]  we'll try and we'll try and win this one. All we can really do is try and carry the games,
[16175.82s -> 16179.18s]  That's about it.
[16179.18s -> 16192.36s]  What is what?
[16192.36s -> 16193.36s]  What man?
[16193.36s -> 16194.36s]  What?
[16194.36s -> 16195.36s]  What do you think they're gonna do to me?
[16195.36s -> 16196.36s]  Welcome to the League of Dream.
[16196.36s -> 16197.36s]  Yo, thank you for the seven months, man.
[16197.36s -> 16198.36s]  Welcome back.
[16198.36s -> 16199.36s]  FB pass.
[16199.36s -> 16200.88s]  Like, I really don't want to mute all.
[16200.88s -> 16201.88s]  I don't.
[16201.88s -> 16203.08s]  I don't want to mute all.
[16203.08s -> 16217.15s]  Because like, I want to like value the pings and shit, but dude.
[16217.15s -> 16219.59s]  If they walk up, I'm going to flank them.
[16219.59s -> 16220.59s]  That's why I'm standing here.
[16220.59s -> 16221.59s]  Okay, they're in the main.
[16221.59s -> 16255.42s]  Oh, that was a big Q.
[16255.42s -> 16257.50s]  I need to get level two first here, a hundred percent.
[16257.50s -> 16278.25s]  Ash should have just been autoing there that whole time
[16279.97s -> 16285.97s]  Because we have heal so she should have just walked up and autoed as soon as this is what I mean by tracking cooldowns
[16286.15s -> 16290.23s]  As soon as the Nico missed her as soon as the Nico mr. Cool down
[16290.75s -> 16295.53s]  So she mr. E. The ash should have just walked up and immediately started fighting
[16296.87s -> 16303.95s]  Right like because they can no longer kill us the Nico doesn't actually have spells outside of her e
[16303.95s -> 16308.95s]  right so if she misses that snare and she used her W too right so it's like we
[16308.95s -> 16315.03s]  just go ham you don't need to be too scared it happens quite a bit sometimes
[16315.03s -> 16337.06s]  where people will just be like really nervous damn if I had dodged that Q I
[16337.06s -> 16341.62s]  actually would have killed all three damn I don't know if it was worth the
[16341.62s -> 16345.66s]  flash after the guy I think it was if I had dodged the Q I would have been fine
[16345.66s -> 16351.46s]  so that was that it's whatever also doesn't miss any creeps here so it's not
[16351.46s -> 16359.39s]  end of the world. Like I'm pretty sure Lee Sin did not have his top camps by the way.
[16366.75s -> 16369.23s]  Damn if I was a little better mechanically I'd turn that by the way.
[16370.59s -> 16399.12s]  100%. We should push this wave so that I can go uh get vision. Because yeah that guy can't
[16399.12s -> 16427.01s]  freeze that wave so it's not too bad. Lee Sin's top. You can kind of see some really good uh
[16427.01s -> 16432.43s]  What is this?
[16432.79s -> 16434.79s]  Why is my cart this afk at turret?
[16435.19s -> 16440.96s]  What is happening right now?
[16440.96s -> 16470.32s]  Why was he afk? I mean, I guess it worked out. But yeah, maybe he had to go let his cat out. I don't know
[16472.64s -> 16481.80s]  Happens we do their bot lane is not very good
[16483.00s -> 16485.28s]  They're trying too hard to force fights that they can't win
[16489.58s -> 16492.46s]  Like they they genuinely can't win half these fights that they're trying to force
[16492.46s -> 16497.02s]  Maybe if they were against people who like don't push their buttons they could win those
[16497.02s -> 16501.04s]  but it's like all I have to do is stand there and fight back and they lose.
[16501.04s -> 16502.90s]  They're on dragon a thousand percent right now.
[16502.90s -> 16506.34s]  There's not a lot I can do about that.
[16506.34s -> 16507.72s]  We just have to chill.
[16507.72s -> 16509.58s]  There's almost nothing I can do about it.
[16509.58s -> 16516.85s]  Kai'sa's trying to fake act like she's big but it's just, there's just nothing we can
[16516.85s -> 16522.26s]  do because our Karthus is top so we just chill.
[16522.26s -> 16527.89s]  Did I finish the cheer quest?
[16527.89s -> 16528.89s]  No no no.
[16528.89s -> 16529.89s]  Not yet.
[16529.89s -> 16540.09s]  Whoa. Lee Sin could be bot right now. I don't think it's too bad if he's bot though. They
[16540.09s -> 16565.02s]  can't really dive us, especially with Karthus ults. Why? Why does my Ashe just run? She
[16565.02s -> 16578.34s]  like just straight up runs away. It's kind of silly. Because we have, we have Karthus
[16578.34s -> 16587.28s]  ulti. Like we can win a fight bot right now. I guess, I guess I'm just going to have to
[16587.28s -> 16594.30s]  get them low enough for Karthus to kill them like without the ashes help which I
[16594.30s -> 16601.55s]  think I can do it's not too bad okay the Akali's coming bot we just kill them I
[16601.55s -> 16615.50s]  mean let's just fight I don't know why we should just Ashe arrow honestly just Ashe
[16615.50s -> 16632.34s]  arrow okay that was pretty bad Ashe arrow but filled I don't think he's
[16632.34s -> 16638.10s]  filled I think he's just having a bad game I think it happens you know whoa
[16638.10s -> 16639.54s]  Okay
[16639.54s -> 16644.46s]  Do it ult me. I fucking dare you
[16645.34s -> 16651.08s]  I'm trying to keep some mana
[16651.48s -> 16653.48s]  So that I can ulti Oh
[16667.02s -> 16677.34s]  Karthus already used his ults fuck they both backed there Wow
[16678.26s -> 16684.22s]  My bad, I honestly didn't think they were both gonna back there
[16684.86s -> 16689.60s]  Like I thought the Kaisa was gonna back right where I saw her like last
[16690.64s -> 16692.52s]  That was my bad
[16692.52s -> 16694.52s]  Mmm, I should be I
[16694.84s -> 16696.84s]  Think we sin can come bot here and kill me. I
[16696.84s -> 16701.38s]  I should actually stop this guy's back
[16706.55s -> 16712.43s]  Yeah, I should stop his back because it's more value to stop the back now, even if we sin isn't bought it's more value
[16713.59s -> 16715.59s]  Cuz he's so low
[16716.47s -> 16718.97s]  Kali is Mia though. So we got to be care. I
[16720.83s -> 16723.39s]  Wasted my old though, which makes me kind of scared
[16723.79s -> 16726.95s]  The other thing that kind of sucks about this is we don't have good vision
[16727.47s -> 16737.45s]  And I can't really help anybody on the map because the same thing is happening as before
[16737.45s -> 16745.16s]  We're like, we're missing opportunities to get kills on timers.
[16745.16s -> 16747.38s]  I mean the dog lightning guy is playing fine this game.
[16747.38s -> 16749.94s]  I think he's trolled a lot like he's, he's trolling.
[16749.94s -> 16752.86s]  This isn't like his best game.
[16752.86s -> 16756.86s]  But it's also I don't know why we're getting so tilted around the map right now.
[16756.86s -> 16762.18s]  Because if I'm, if I'm being honest, we should just win the game off of like being better
[16762.18s -> 16763.18s]  players.
[16763.18s -> 16782.21s]  I don't know what this Karthus is thinking, but do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do
[16782.21s -> 16783.21s]  it.
[16783.21s -> 16787.34s]  We can fight, just fight.
[16787.34s -> 16790.08s]  Bro, what are we doing?
[16790.74s -> 16791.82s]  I'm losing it, man.
[16791.82s -> 16793.94s]  Oh, no, no, no, I'm tilted.
[16793.94s -> 16794.78s]  I'm tilted as fuck.
[16794.78s -> 16796.22s]  He didn't walk in.
[16796.22s -> 16798.92s]  Just go on to the Akali shroud, man.
[16800.46s -> 16804.32s]  I just walk a foot to your right and stand on the Akali shroud.
[16804.90s -> 16807.82s]  She just eats your damage like while she's in the shroud.
[16807.86s -> 16812.89s]  She can't stop that.
[16812.89s -> 16816.94s]  Holy shit, I'm losing my mind.
[16816.94s -> 16819.66s]  Like Ashe is just inting bot waves right now,
[16819.66s -> 16821.66s]  Not trying to do anything
[16822.30s -> 16826.70s]  Lux is really far up on cs, which is really good, but i'm losing it man
[16828.70s -> 16831.02s]  Like we we see exactly where they are every game
[16831.58s -> 16837.02s]  Like we see where everybody is on the enemy team permanently and we still can't manage to like walk to the right location
[16838.06s -> 16842.00s]  This is driving me crazy
[16842.00s -> 16844.00s]  My my karthus
[16844.00s -> 16846.24s]  80 my karthus jungle is getting out farmed
[16847.12s -> 16850.74s]  Like a karthus jungle is getting out farmed by a lee sin jungle. That's insane
[16851.68s -> 16854.74s]  Like I don't think I don't think I can stress enough how crazy that is
[16855.30s -> 16860.48s]  Like there should never be a world where Karthus ever gets out farms
[16865.37s -> 16867.37s]  No way
[16867.37s -> 16875.03s]  I'm dead dude. No way. I just fucking ate the end of that now. I'm playing that just kill the Lee Sin man. I
[16884.48s -> 16886.48s]  Fucked up there
[16886.96s -> 16890.80s]  That was my fault cuz I got hit by the tip of the that was my fault
[16890.80s -> 16894.44s]  I got barely clipped by the tip of the Nico bolts when I was trying to space cuz I'm bad
[16894.44s -> 16898.94s]  And if I was alive there, and I could have saved my flash for the Lee Sin Q, we just
[16898.94s -> 16901.63s]  win.
[16901.63s -> 16907.37s]  I am confused at why we decided to like not fight that immediately though, like we caught
[16907.37s -> 16910.29s]  out two of their members, and we just got scared for whatever reason.
[16910.29s -> 16911.89s]  Wait, we win this, fight.
[16911.89s -> 16929.10s]  We 1000% win this, fight this, fight this, fight this.
[16929.10s -> 16931.82s]  Bro do not throw a fucking temper tantrum right now.
[16931.82s -> 16938.43s]  There's one kill, do not throw a temper tantrum.
[16938.43s -> 16940.79s]  Oh my god, here we go.
[16940.79s -> 16951.82s]  I took one kill, the guy's about to lose his mind, guys.
[16951.82s -> 16953.38s]  I need to mute all.
[16953.38s -> 16954.98s]  I'm gonna mute all in a second.
[16956.14s -> 16961.46s]  Like, I can't with these people right now.
[16961.46s -> 16962.30s]  Like, I can't, man.
[16962.30s -> 16963.78s]  You people are disgusting.
[16965.06s -> 16968.14s]  Like, you guys just whine, you play bad,
[16968.14s -> 16970.34s]  you whine and you bitch about every little mistake
[16970.34s -> 16971.78s]  that everything happens,
[16971.78s -> 16973.62s]  even though it's like in the middle of a fight,
[16973.62s -> 16975.58s]  I guarantee I'm a better player than you are,
[16975.58s -> 16978.26s]  and you're still whining and crying over one shutdown
[16978.26s -> 16981.82s]  that like, you didn't even walk to until I spam pinged you.
[16981.82s -> 16984.78s]  Like I literally 1v2'd them, you hit one E,
[16984.78s -> 16988.49s]  and now you're mad.
[16988.49s -> 16995.91s]  Dude, I swear, League players are fucking psychopaths.
[16995.91s -> 16997.43s]  At least I got the exhaust off.
[16997.43s -> 16999.35s]  Surely she dies, right?
[16999.35s -> 17001.27s]  Surely she dies here.
[17001.27s -> 17002.11s]  Or not.
[17002.11s -> 17003.71s]  Okay.
[17003.71s -> 17004.91s]  Okay, at least she died.
[17006.39s -> 17007.51s]  Help each other, guys.
[17008.99s -> 17012.80s]  Help each other, teamwork.
[17012.80s -> 17014.24s]  Teamwork, teamwork, teamwork.
[17014.24s -> 17019.89s]  Teamwork.
[17019.89s -> 17021.25s]  Wait, this Ashe is insane.
[17026.11s -> 17029.33s]  Okay, I'm not gonna lie, that Ashe played that so good.
[17029.33s -> 17031.91s]  I only saw the end of it and she still played that good.
[17032.91s -> 17033.75s]  That was sick.
[17035.31s -> 17036.51s]  Well done.
[17036.51s -> 17040.28s]  That was actually really good.
[17040.28s -> 17041.68s]  She almost stopped the dive.
[17042.60s -> 17047.94s]  That's crazy.
[17047.94s -> 17051.74s]  This game is definitely 1000% still winnable though.
[17051.74s -> 17054.64s]  We just have to play for late game
[17054.64s -> 17056.64s]  and not lose our fucking minds.
[17056.64s -> 17058.04s]  I'll let that push back into my Ashe.
[17058.04s -> 17062.62s]  I'll go mid and get some vision.
[17062.62s -> 17065.06s]  That's pretty much all we have to do.
[17065.06s -> 17072.14s]  Play for late and not lose our mind early.
[17072.14s -> 17073.78s]  We could play to kill the Sakali right now.
[17073.78s -> 17075.78s]  She doesn't know, there's no ward here.
[17077.22s -> 17082.05s]  We could also invade here.
[17082.05s -> 17083.41s]  Oh, that's so unlucky.
[17084.73s -> 17091.28s]  That was such a close Q.
[17091.28s -> 17114.02s]  Kill that guy.
[17114.02s -> 17119.77s]  Jesus Christ.
[17119.77s -> 17122.29s]  I feel like we should have won that fight.
[17122.29s -> 17125.17s]  I feel like something awkward happened and we lost.
[17125.17s -> 17129.05s]  Did my Ashe just walk directly into this Akali and not use her ulti?
[17129.05s -> 17129.89s]  Use your ulti.
[17129.89s -> 17131.05s]  You have ulti.
[17131.05s -> 17132.61s]  Use your ulti.
[17132.61s -> 17142.12s]  Oh my god.
[17142.12s -> 17145.35s]  What the fuck?
[17145.35s -> 17148.75s]  Oh my god.
[17148.75s -> 17151.91s]  I don't even know what to say right now.
[17151.91s -> 17154.63s]  This is insane.
[17154.63s -> 17157.83s]  This genuinely feels like everybody in the game is losing their mind
[17157.83s -> 17163.96s]  in the freest game I've ever seen in my life.
[17163.96s -> 17166.96s]  Like that's what we're losing to right there, that guy.
[17166.96s -> 17170.80s]  The guy who like doesn't understand how Senna works.
[17170.80s -> 17172.12s]  Like that player.
[17172.12s -> 17173.16s]  That's why I'm frustrated.
[17173.16s -> 17177.72s]  Like that player right there has no idea how Senna works.
[17177.72s -> 17178.66s]  Tries to fight me.
[17179.68s -> 17181.80s]  And we're like losing to that guy.
[17181.80s -> 17183.80s]  Like I'm trying really hard not to be an asshole,
[17183.80s -> 17186.50s]  but like it's flooding out right now from these games.
[17188.24s -> 17192.60s]  It's crazy.
[17192.60s -> 17193.98s]  Like he's so toxic.
[17193.98s -> 17194.94s]  Look at this.
[17194.94s -> 17197.48s]  He went proto belt Ionia boot.
[17199.94s -> 17203.22s]  Nico, but like what that doesn't do anything to help his team
[17219.04s -> 17221.38s]  You could arrow that guy. I mean, it's not impossible
[17223.44s -> 17225.44s]  Or don't that's fine
[17235.97s -> 17243.07s]  Oh my god
[17243.07s -> 17245.07s]  Guys, I think my luck says afk
[17248.05s -> 17250.05s]  She's been sitting in base for like five minutes
[17256.53s -> 17258.45s]  I think she's like
[17258.45s -> 17260.45s]  Literally just throwing or some shits
[17261.09s -> 17273.42s]  All right, let's push this wave
[17273.42s -> 17275.42s]  We could make a pick right now
[17275.42s -> 17281.94s]  Jax, what are you doing, man?
[17281.94s -> 17282.94s]  Why are you up there?
[17282.94s -> 17285.57s]  Oh no.
[17285.57s -> 17295.94s]  Also, why does this Ashe have the worst build I've ever seen?
[17295.94s -> 17298.94s]  Dude, if we lose to the Kai'sa that just did that, I'm gonna lose my mind.
[17298.94s -> 17319.26s]  Like, that guy just blind-R'd in without any vision of anybody and just died.
[17319.26s -> 17321.26s]  There's just no way we can lose this.
[17321.26s -> 17329.19s]  We got this, guys. Just play.
[17329.19s -> 17333.19s]  Like, I just need to... I need help getting vision control on Baron and mid.
[17333.19s -> 17335.19s]  And then we can... we can win.
[17335.19s -> 17384.07s]  We got this.
[17384.07s -> 17416.67s]  Right now.
[17416.67s -> 17417.59s]  I mean, we still got Baron,
[17417.59s -> 17421.50s]  but he did get two of them, I guess.
[17421.50s -> 17423.86s]  Or no, he only, yeah, he got Karthus and Ashe.
[17424.82s -> 17433.87s]  But we did get Baron, which is very nice, so.
[17433.87s -> 17436.07s]  I'm gonna go Dom's this game.
[17436.07s -> 17437.39s]  Normally I go
[17439.27s -> 17454.00s]  Black Cleaver, but I think I'm gonna go Dom's.
[17454.00s -> 17470.75s]  I need to get vision control on Dragon and mid.
[17470.75s -> 17471.91s]  I need to get vision control,
[17471.91s -> 17473.61s]  and I need help to do it, though.
[17474.83s -> 17484.04s]  I'm gonna act like I'm backing here.
[17484.04s -> 17486.60s]  We should just be pushing mid with baron. I don't know what we're doing
[17488.36s -> 17491.32s]  Like like loki it should just be straight up like we go mid with baron here
[17502.95s -> 17504.95s]  What the fuck was that? That was a terrible play
[17522.20s -> 17524.20s]  Guys, just just come mid. We have baron
[17533.94s -> 17536.10s]  Nice huge pick push mid push mid
[17537.54s -> 17552.60s]  Fuck dragon just push mid. Okay. Now we back off. Oh, I mean that was
[17554.20s -> 17562.22s]  Bad guys back off back off back off leave leave leave please please just leave
[17562.62s -> 17568.14s]  Guys, you can leave, you can leave.
[17568.14s -> 17573.42s]  We can just go do dragon, leave.
[17573.42s -> 17574.86s]  We still have so much gold to get on the map.
[17574.86s -> 17577.02s]  We can go get bot tier two.
[17577.02s -> 17578.50s]  Bot tier one, bot tier two.
[17579.42s -> 17580.92s]  We have so much gold to get on the map.
[17580.92s -> 17581.76s]  It's not a big deal, right?
[17581.76s -> 17584.20s]  Like we don't need to end the game right this second.
[17584.20s -> 17588.42s]  We actually have Karthus and we have Jax too.
[17588.42s -> 17620.14s]  So like our scaling is really good.
[17620.14s -> 17635.34s]  I need to go get, I need to go get my next item,
[17635.34s -> 17636.94s]  but I need enough gold to do it.
[17636.94s -> 17643.26s]  I also need to go get wards, this sucks I'm on like a weird buy timer where like I don't
[17643.26s -> 17648.06s]  have enough things to get, you know what I'm just going to get my ward item, I'm going
[17648.06s -> 17652.34s]  to grab this for right now just so we can actually get some power on the map, because
[17652.34s -> 17655.70s]  the map is so dark and I think getting the ward item before finishing my last whisper
[17655.70s -> 17662.40s]  item is probably the smartest call.
[17662.40s -> 17669.12s]  I am a little concerned why we're not pushing bot with Jax, we're pushing top, and I'm also
[17669.12s -> 17675.28s]  concerned why we're not playing for mid prio and we're just farming bot side
[17675.28s -> 17685.48s]  this is such an awkward fucking thing like we should just be playing for mid
[17685.48s -> 17689.60s]  prio and use arrow to engage that's how we win we just use arrow to engage when
[17689.60s -> 17701.30s]  they contest mid it's actually that easy like low key it's actually that easy
[17701.30s -> 17721.03s]  see watch now this guy's dead I mean that's fine with me you guys want to
[17721.03s -> 17740.36s]  to kill me that's totally fine they can get the inhib and then they can back up yeah yeah get inhib
[17740.36s -> 17748.72s]  back up and then play for play for baron they'll only have a few seconds to do this though so
[17748.72s -> 17764.45s]  it's kind of scary because these two are gonna be alive they need to back immediately just reset
[17764.45s -> 17768.53s]  you don't need the wave just leave leave leave baron's up baron's up think about the macro guys
[17768.53s -> 17776.28s]  the macro we play for baron now because there's a timer now where like you guys just need to
[17776.28s -> 17783.64s]  reset because there's a timer where the enemy has tempo on the map and if we don't uh if we don't
[17783.64s -> 17788.44s]  allow if if we don't reset they'll just rush baron and there's nothing we can do about it
[17798.55s -> 17802.47s]  okay they're not on baron i think they missed their timer they're on it no no they're on it
[17802.47s -> 17814.13s]  they're on it they're on it okay they're not on it we're fine we can still fight this though but
[17814.13s -> 17826.40s]  we need everybody here just arrow arrow ash arrow arrow arrow it doesn't matter if you hit mouth
[17826.40s -> 17837.44s]  Just arrow. Just arrow him. Thank you. No, no. Guys, the back line.
[17837.44s -> 17845.84s]  The back line. Play together. Play together. Yes! Nice.
[17848.88s -> 17857.65s]  End of the game. You end. You end here. Lux, don't back. You are giving me cancer.
[17857.65s -> 17862.61s]  Okay. They forfeit it. Dude, look how easy that is. Look how easy it is to win games
[17862.61s -> 17867.17s]  when people are listening to macro. Look how easy it is. Oh my god!
[17868.85s -> 17873.57s]  I'm losing it man. I swear to God. I'm losing my hair. I can feel my hair falling out right now
[17873.57s -> 17878.89s]  I can feel it falling out of my fucking head like like I just lost one. It's right there. Look like it's just
[17880.17s -> 17882.17s]  Fucking kill me man
[17882.17s -> 17884.17s]  In game. God
[17884.33s -> 17887.33s]  It's so hard. I feel so exhausted
[17888.25s -> 17890.25s]  Like it's so exhausting
[17890.57s -> 17897.40s]  You played a 44 minute gold game God damn
[17897.40s -> 17906.56s]  That's impressive. I don't want to honor any of these people. Who would you guys honor?
[17907.48s -> 17912.24s]  Like out of all of them, who'd you guys pick? Cuz I don't know they all suck. In my eyes, I'm too toxic right now
[17912.24s -> 17916.04s]  They all suck
[17916.04s -> 17927.88s]  Jax? Alright, I'll give it to Jax. Ash? Ash was trying. I'll give you that. Ash was trying. Dude, look at this Lux
[17929.00s -> 17939.51s]  This Lux got so fucking carried. Oh my god. Oh my god
[17939.51s -> 17944.51s]  God, don't type to me, you pedestrian.
[17948.99s -> 17951.47s]  This man called him a pedestrian.
[17959.52s -> 17961.92s]  That's not even an insult.
[17961.92s -> 17965.60s]  Like, oh yeah, yeah, wow, fucking pedestrian.
[17965.60s -> 17987.96s]  Like, that's not even an insult, man.
[17987.96s -> 17991.88s]  Dude, guys, I feel like part of my life
[17991.88s -> 17993.32s]  gets taken away, you know?
[17994.96s -> 17996.24s]  Like when I play on my main account
[17996.24s -> 17998.40s]  and I'm like super sweaty, tryharding and shit,
[17998.40s -> 18005.48s]  I feel like, I feel like I'm losing like, yeah, it's like, it's like every time I lose, it's like one hair or like every time I'm like barely win, right?
[18005.48s -> 18011.44s]  It's just like every game in this elo is like one hair on my head gets fucking burnt out and it just leaves and I'm not like
[18011.44s -> 18032.31s]  I'm gonna be like Homer Simpson
[18032.31s -> 18037.43s]  Like look at the difference in wards placed. This is what annoys me about bad support players
[18038.19s -> 18040.19s]  This guy placed 23
[18041.07s -> 18044.75s]  He's more focused on getting kills than placing wards and it's really stupid
[18044.75s -> 18054.06s]  stupid. Sorry, I just don't listen. I don't have anything against the dog lightning guy
[18054.06s -> 18060.12s]  as a person other than like what I've seen on his stream, right? Like on his stream,
[18060.12s -> 18065.66s]  he just seems really egotistical. Like he's he's like everything I hate in the average
[18065.66s -> 18072.02s]  league player. He's he has a massive ego because he reached challenger on the support role
[18072.02s -> 18076.38s]  on like an off meta pick, like last year at some point or something or maybe he's challenger
[18076.38s -> 18079.66s]  right now I don't even know maybe he has an account in challenger I don't even
[18079.66s -> 18087.56s]  know but it drives me crazy because like he doesn't do anything correctly like he
[18087.56s -> 18092.76s]  gets away with such dumb shit because he like he like basically wins lane because
[18092.76s -> 18097.48s]  he plays extremely aggressively but if you guys noticed in that game the reason
[18097.48s -> 18101.20s]  we won lane or we were able to push back is because they played
[18101.20s -> 18105.52s]  aggressively but they did it really stupidly like they were fighting us in
[18105.52s -> 18110.88s]  our own waves right like on repeat they were just fighting us in our own waves every time i would
[18110.88s -> 18115.92s]  just turn a one for one almost a one for two every time and it's it's stupid because every time that's
[18115.92s -> 18120.48s]  happening they're also giving me souls right and he would like take weird fights and like i know
[18120.48s -> 18124.40s]  he's probably for fun and he doesn't care it's a smurf blah blah blah but i just don't like when
[18124.40s -> 18135.93s]  people like that like ego their ass off when they play so badly it drives me crazy why do i care so
[18135.93s -> 18162.52s]  much i don't know i don't know how are you guys doing by the way how's everybody's day going in
[18162.52s -> 18167.96s]  chat what you guys up to talk to me i know i stopped like teaching the game and started whining
[18167.96s -> 18172.28s]  like i got on my main account a few hours ago and i stopped teaching and i started whining a bunch so
[18174.76s -> 18189.68s]  my bad my bad on that one dudes how you guys doing now how's everybody's day going when
[18189.68s -> 18196.72s]  the coaching service is open oh i could probably do coaching at some point soon like i'd be willing
[18196.72s -> 18201.60s]  to do some coaching some like sub coaching or something or like something like that it might
[18201.60s -> 18215.50s]  be fun sucking in bronze you don't get enough time to actually improve dude i feel that man it takes a
[18215.50s -> 18220.54s]  long time league is not an easy game to pick up and start playing right like if you're if you're
[18220.54s -> 18223.66s]  in bronze or silver and you're like oh i actually you know i'm having fun playing the game i kind
[18223.66s -> 18227.74s]  of want to try and get better it's you're just overwhelmed with so much info that you like have
[18227.74s -> 18247.18s]  to play so many games right like i i feel you man like it's it's overwhelming yeah i i i feel you
[18256.00s -> 18265.02s]  well we got mid okay uh should i just play tryst well i'm worried if i pick tryst that we won't
[18265.02s -> 18272.70s]  have ap but i also think i'm better at tryst than i am at like other stuff so i don't know
[18272.70s -> 18289.02s]  AP Varus? I'm not good enough at AP Varus man. I'm gonna be real. Well my Malz is good,
[18289.02s -> 18293.38s]  but the problem with Malz is like Malz is a shitty champion. Like Malz is trash right?
[18293.38s -> 18301.06s]  So like he's good, but he's like not good in the sense of like I can play him well,
[18301.06s -> 18309.28s]  but at the end of the day if they pick something that like counters Malz, I just lose. Whereas
[18309.28s -> 18315.04s]  like Tristana is just free to pick like even if we play all ad right let's say we do all
[18315.04s -> 18319.40s]  ad or some shit like on accident or because people are one tricks blah blah blah it's
[18319.40s -> 18324.58s]  it's still free like Tristana is still like a good pick because even with all ad she's
[18324.58s -> 18329.56s]  still like you can build lord doms she has incredibly high pressure early game if you
[18329.56s -> 18333.80s]  play her right right like you could push the waves roam uh you can you can roam top roam
[18333.80s -> 18338.74s]  bot help lanes out like level 2-3 you can evade junglers early like she's just incredibly
[18338.74s -> 18347.37s]  incredibly strong this guy should go pike i was gonna say they picked nunu and i picked an ad mid
[18347.37s -> 18354.89s]  they picked nunu and thresh we should have an engage because because pike trist like i can
[18354.89s -> 18370.26s]  just walk bot on repeat now and pretty much kill people watch an iron game watching an iron game i
[18370.26s -> 18377.27s]  feel like it wouldn't be an actual iron game though would it i've heard i had friends who
[18377.27s -> 18384.23s]  like intentionally lost a bunch of games uh and so they could get to iron 4 right they like they
[18384.23s -> 18392.79s]  like into down to iron 4 or whatever to see if they could make it and uh there's just so many
[18392.79s -> 18401.83s]  like smurfs in iron there's like legitimate bot bot accounts like like accounts that are
[18401.83s -> 18406.71s]  like being botted right there's like botted accounts in iron there's like smurfs all over
[18406.71s -> 18420.10s]  the place, it seems to have stopped. I wonder if Riot like did something that stopped the bots.
[18421.70s -> 18425.14s]  They must, they may have, like they may have just like incorporated something that like stops the
[18425.14s -> 18434.82s]  software, but I don't know. I haven't heard anything about it, but I have no clue. I'll
[18434.82s -> 18464.49s]  be real, I don't know. You had to take Foggy around last game and got Boots 1. Dude, that sounds
[18464.49s -> 18476.57s]  awful i kind of feel bad for actual iron players who are like in iron trying to climb because like
[18477.37s -> 18495.38s]  that sounds bad i do think you can climb obviously out of any elo it doesn't matter
[18495.38s -> 18498.42s]  right like if i were to go in an iron game i'd probably drop like 50 kills
[18500.86s -> 18520.06s]  but i so i do think you can climb out of any you know any elo for sure you love on your
[18520.06s -> 18531.50s]  new account if you guys had a bot account that answered every time i wrote bot that's funny
[18531.74s -> 18544.87s]  Yeah, I assume that's a good point. I guess if you're in iron you could like play to learn the game a bit better
[18544.87s -> 18548.63s]  And then you could like play a new account and see where you got. Yeah, I know that would work
[18549.63s -> 18560.42s]  That makes sense. Sure. I'll first pick men. I'll first pick Senna. I
[18563.74s -> 18567.74s]  Guarantee they walk in fucking these people are gonna walk in fucking
[18568.42s -> 18570.42s]  Nautilus or some shits
[18570.58s -> 18572.54s]  It'll be like Jarvan
[18572.54s -> 18574.54s]  Nautilus
[18574.54s -> 18577.26s]  Uh, I don't even know
[18582.98s -> 18587.42s]  Riven's not too bad for Senna. It's okay. It's okay. You don't get flanks. I actually don't think Riven's too bad right now
[18587.66s -> 18591.30s]  Maybe all the Riven players I've played against suck, but I don't think she's actually that bad
[18591.30s -> 18597.72s]  I think Riven's like just you have to position well, I think Riven's really broken at abusing positioning
[18598.34s -> 18600.34s]  That's why she's so good in solo queue
[18600.50s -> 18607.02s]  Like good Riven players all get really gross flanks and the flanks are what's OP. Yeah, there's the Gragas
[18607.02s -> 18609.18s]  Okay, I was like they're gonna pick something to fuck me over
[18609.74s -> 18614.88s]  This guy picked Gragas, but it was gonna be like J4 or Gragas or something
[18615.76s -> 18618.36s]  And then this guy is the support. He'll probably pick Nautilus
[18620.00s -> 18622.00s]  Unless he's a one trick
[18622.40s -> 18626.44s]  Right, like unless this guy's straight up just like a one trick. He'll pick like Nautilus or some shits
[18629.16s -> 18631.24s]  Maybe Rakan. Rakan or Nautilus
[18631.88s -> 18642.85s]  Cuz if he picks an enchanter, we just win the game. He has to pick engage
[18647.34s -> 18649.34s]  Melio would be really good here too, actually
[18650.82s -> 18656.66s]  Because Melio would counter half our team you can Melio Q Wukong and Kennen engage
[18658.38s -> 18670.83s]  Like if this guy played Melio this would actually be a hard lane Tom Kinch, I mean I I get it but I think it's bad
[18672.75s -> 18679.87s]  Runes oh shit. Yo, you just saved me looking like an absolute fool. Thank you
[18681.31s -> 18684.73s]  Holy crap if you wanted to see my runes they're here, but thank you you reminded me
[18684.73s -> 18686.25s]  Here, I'm gonna be over here, I'm gonna get some water.
[18686.25s -> 18687.05s]  I'll be right back.
[18687.73s -> 18688.61s]  Get some agua.
[18728.67s -> 18731.07s]  By the way, the people who are here to watch me play AD carry...
[18732.35s -> 18734.03s]  I sincerely apologize.
[18735.07s -> 18739.07s]  I know watching me play Senna is probably boring as fuck.
[18742.32s -> 18742.88s]  Okay?
[18743.20s -> 18743.84s]  I know.
[18744.88s -> 18748.56s]  And I promise you, we will play AD carry at some point.
[18748.56s -> 18749.52s]  I promise you.
[18750.08s -> 18753.36s]  I played like, the first four hours of the stream was AD carry, or the first three.
[18753.76s -> 18755.92s]  Right, I played on my Smurf for a few games and played some AD.
[18755.92s -> 18759.24s]  So if you want to watch that you can go back in the VOD. We did some like commentary and shit
[18761.28s -> 18765.30s]  The only reason I'm playing so much Senna and support on this account is because like
[18766.28s -> 18773.38s]  the elo I'm currently in is like the worst elo to climb in solo queue because of a lot of factors and
[18774.64s -> 18777.10s]  Support has some of the highest impact on the game
[18779.36s -> 18781.28s]  Whereas like ad carry has high impact at late
[18781.28s -> 18785.66s]  but in in solo queue you want to have high impact early and I wanted to be able to
[18785.66s -> 18821.46s]  uh impacts the game really early on so yeah sorry about being you know boring and shit i just really
[18821.46s -> 18827.86s]  want to like win games at least on this account i want to get out of the silo because the faster i
[18827.86s -> 18845.74s]  get out of the silo the the faster um the faster i get out of the silo the faster i can have fun
[18845.74s -> 18853.50s]  playing ad carry and like try and climb what a weird like what a weird play by these guys what
[18853.50s -> 18854.86s]  What the fuck?
[18854.86s -> 18859.34s]  They like half shoved the waves
[18859.34s -> 18860.98s]  to get like early bush control
[18860.98s -> 18872.53s]  and then they do shit like that.
[18872.53s -> 18873.35s]  This guy's just dead.
[18873.35s -> 18878.64s]  I'm gonna give it to Twitch.
[18878.64s -> 18880.40s]  Nice, we got his exhausts.
[18880.40s -> 18881.96s]  So I wasted my exhaust there.
[18881.96s -> 18883.52s]  I did it because I thought the Jinx
[18883.52s -> 18884.96s]  was gonna insta flash.
[18886.76s -> 18887.60s]  Like I didn't exhaust it
[18887.60s -> 18889.64s]  because I was like scared of her damage.
[18889.64s -> 18891.44s]  I did it because I thought she was gonna like
[18891.44s -> 18893.40s]  try and flash away the second that...
[18895.28s -> 18896.76s]  But I landed my snare.
[18896.76s -> 18897.72s]  It was kind of bad by me.
[18897.72s -> 18899.72s]  I mean, I landed my snare so I didn't need to exhaust her.
[18899.72s -> 18901.72s]  I just was like, oh, maybe she'll flash.
[18901.72s -> 18903.72s]  She did not. She did not flash.
[18905.72s -> 18907.72s]  What deal is this? This is 500 LP Masters.
[18907.72s -> 18909.72s]  400 LP.
[18909.72s -> 18911.72s]  It's insane, I know.
[18911.72s -> 18913.72s]  Absolutely crazy.
[18913.72s -> 18937.19s]  Put that ward there, because Gragas is probably bot.
[18937.19s -> 18939.19s]  Yeah.
[18939.19s -> 18948.20s]  So.
[18948.20s -> 18950.20s]  Mmm, they're trying to come up from bot
[18950.20s -> 18953.64s]  to kill me here.
[18953.64s -> 18955.64s]  Like, their bot lane is rotating up to try and kill me.
[18955.64s -> 18961.36s]  So, just be careful Twitch, they're in here, man.
[18962.80s -> 18972.86s]  I actually have to back and walk, look.
[18972.86s -> 18974.06s]  This is hilarious.
[18974.06s -> 18976.10s]  The enemy bot lane literally is roaming mid.
[18976.10s -> 18977.50s]  Look at this.
[18977.50s -> 18980.82s]  What?
[18980.82s -> 18985.27s]  Why?
[18985.27s -> 18991.15s]  I'm not trying to soak his XP, I just want those souls.
[18991.15s -> 19006.09s]  I'm scared to walk in here, I don't know where Gragas is.
[19006.09s -> 19007.41s]  I gotta come bot to help my Twitch
[19007.41s -> 19011.55s]  so they don't freeze the wave.
[19011.55s -> 19015.98s]  Like, I don't want them to be able to freeze here.
[19015.98s -> 19020.53s]  Even if Gragas ganks, we win the fight right now.
[19020.53s -> 19022.17s]  Like, it's an easy fight win.
[19022.17s -> 19023.41s]  As long as we don't get knocked up,
[19023.41s -> 19032.46s]  we just win the fight automatically.
[19032.46s -> 19043.30s]  Actually, we're trying to bait Gragas to come gank this.
[19043.30s -> 19044.94s]  Easy.
[19044.94s -> 19051.76s]  Double flashes, baby, easy.
[19051.76s -> 19065.16s]  You fucking cowards.
[19065.16s -> 19066.72s]  We should back up.
[19066.72s -> 19068.42s]  I can go buy now.
[19068.42s -> 19070.08s]  Oh, Gragas is top.
[19070.08s -> 19073.76s]  We could actually maybe do dragon.
[19073.76s -> 19074.60s]  Yo, I'm gonna be real.
[19074.60s -> 19077.00s]  A-Soul roaming is not in the top list
[19077.00s -> 19078.84s]  with me being like nervous about it.
[19081.08s -> 19086.50s]  Like I'm not nervous about acel roaming, man.
[19086.50s -> 19089.00s]  Push this so we can, oh, we're diving them?
[19090.06s -> 19091.00s]  That's a bit scary.
[19091.00s -> 19094.50s]  Welcome to the League of Draven.
[19094.50s -> 19097.24s]  Good to see you're back to enjoying the game.
[19097.24s -> 19098.84s]  Whoa, Wukong's still diving that?
[19098.84s -> 19100.48s]  That's not good.
[19100.48s -> 19107.16s]  Like we back off here, man.
[19107.16s -> 19115.50s]  I mean, we can maybe go up here if you really want to.
[19115.50s -> 19123.54s]  I kind of want to ward this.
[19123.54s -> 19130.57s]  I need to reset though really badly right now.
[19130.57s -> 19140.09s]  really badly. Not being on the map here is really bad. Or rather not like having uh gold spent and
[19140.09s -> 19144.89s]  being on the map is what I meant to say like it's really fucking bad. Yo back up. You know Gragas
[19144.89s -> 19150.49s]  that you watched him walk past three wards. That's why I just warded. No no he's still here.
[19151.45s -> 19157.29s]  Gragas is right there. Like we we know Gragas is somewhere bot lane right now. I don't know where
[19157.29s -> 19169.15s]  but we know he's there. They're on dragon, okay. We can fight this, go go go. W over,
[19169.15s -> 19190.63s]  I'm here. Nice. Yo, come here. Yo, I'll help you. Come get this, come get this motherfuckers
[19190.63s -> 19231.02s]  blue. I got you baby. What the fuck? Later bitch. Well, I guess I'll back. Yo Spartan,
[19231.02s -> 19233.02s]  Thank you for the six months, man. Welcome back
[19233.90s -> 19235.90s]  Appreciate it
[19235.90s -> 19238.66s]  Yes, we'll back we'll get our fucking umbral
[19239.98s -> 19241.98s]  I'm gonna go top side of the map now
[19242.66s -> 19244.82s]  And I'm gonna help my team get rift heralds
[19245.62s -> 19248.52s]  I'm gonna ping. I want to go top side. I want to help my team get rifts
[19249.16s -> 19259.30s]  The wave if we look at bot wave it's pushing into us. It's totally fine
[19260.20s -> 19262.20s]  Okay, twitch is level six
[19262.20s -> 19274.37s]  The bot waves pushing in we are totally fine to do what I'm doing right now. He doesn't
[19274.37s -> 19302.29s]  know I'm here. I'm dead though. Bro. No joke. I almost juked that. That's so close. I was
[19302.29s -> 19309.09s]  hoping like wukong for some reason didn't walk topside. But the enemy bot lane did.
[19309.09s -> 19317.45s]  Okay, the enemy bot lane just griefed their entire game. The game's over we win. What
[19317.45s -> 19318.89s]  What the fuck are they doing?
[19318.89s -> 19319.89s]  What is happening?
[19319.89s -> 19324.75s]  Like, my Twitch is just getting free plates.
[19324.75s -> 19340.16s]  Wait, you guys are griefing.
[19340.16s -> 19341.64s]  I'm griefing.
[19341.64s -> 19344.40s]  Dude, what the fuck?
[19344.40s -> 19346.60s]  We- Why would you fight them?
[19346.60s -> 19350.40s]  Guys, guys, guys, Wukong.
[19350.40s -> 19351.40s]  Wukong!
[19351.40s -> 19355.88s]  Okay, we see that our Twitch is getting free plates bot, free first turret.
[19355.88s -> 19357.28s]  Okay, I'm backed.
[19357.28s -> 19359.84s]  I almost soloed their AD carry, okay?
[19359.84s -> 19361.18s]  Or their jungler.
[19361.18s -> 19367.18s]  Why would you ever, on purpose, take a fight like that with no-
[19367.18s -> 19370.18s]  Oh, I have cancer.
[19370.18s -> 19373.14s]  Also, the Wukong's an idiot.
[19373.14s -> 19378.54s]  He doesn't understand macro at all, apparently, because I literally pinged to come to Rift,
[19378.54s -> 19380.78s]  my Wukong was like, nervous.
[19380.78s -> 19387.62s]  Like, for some reason Wukong didn't walk top, he sat bot trying to gank.
[19387.62s -> 19389.26s]  But the objective was Rift, not-
[19389.26s -> 19394.14s]  God, I'm losing my mind in this ELO.
[19394.14s -> 19399.22s]  Masters players are literally just diamond players with slightly better mechanics.
[19399.22s -> 19402.46s]  They don't know anything about the game and I'm about to, my brain's about to explode
[19402.46s -> 19405.28s]  like a peanut.
[19405.28s -> 19409.52s]  It's not about them laning 2v2, you fucking kumquat.
[19409.52s -> 19412.84s]  Dude, I know they can't lane against us 2v2.
[19412.84s -> 19414.80s]  It's not about the 2v2, man.
[19414.80s -> 19419.56s]  We get a free rift, Harold, because we shut down their bot lane and I'm on an item spike.
[19419.56s -> 19421.92s]  So we just automatically get a free rift.
[19421.92s -> 19427.05s]  It has nothing to do with 2v2.
[19427.05s -> 19428.05s]  This kumquat motherfucker.
[19428.05s -> 19435.97s]  I don't know why that's my insult.
[19435.97s -> 19438.57s]  The pedestrian guy got to me.
[19438.57s -> 19439.57s]  Somehow.
[19439.57s -> 19449.10s]  Where the fuck is this ward?
[19449.10s -> 19450.10s]  Oh.
[19450.10s -> 19460.62s]  Cause I'm telling you right now, my macro there was 100% correct by the way.
[19460.62s -> 19461.62s]  Like 1000%.
[19461.62s -> 19473.55s]  Like even though I died, I know it was correct.
[19473.55s -> 19474.55s]  No!
[19474.55s -> 19475.55s]  No, just do dragon.
[19475.55s -> 19476.55s]  Do not dive.
[19476.55s -> 19478.43s]  Guys, we don't have to... Not everything's about kills.
[19478.43s -> 19479.91s]  Not everything's about kills. We got this.
[19481.19s -> 19483.07s]  Like, you don't need to dive. You don't need to dive always.
[19483.07s -> 19484.33s]  You don't need to see a kill and be like,
[19484.33s -> 19485.91s]  ooh, monkey, kill, brain, go.
[19486.27s -> 19489.81s]  Like, the game is about, like, getting objectives on timers
[19489.81s -> 19492.41s]  and playing off of tempo and things like that.
[19492.91s -> 19495.65s]  Like, the only reason we even lost Rift was because
[19495.65s -> 19498.09s]  my Wukong went full monkey brain and was like,
[19498.09s -> 19500.25s]  no, we need to not play for this Rift
[19500.25s -> 19502.09s]  with a giant, massive lead.
[19522.42s -> 19523.42s]  Wait, kill this guy.
[19523.42s -> 19532.33s]  What am I watching right now?
[19532.33s -> 19533.63s]  This is outrageous.
[19533.63s -> 19535.23s]  My Wukong just solo ulted their...
[19535.23s -> 19536.51s]  Dude, I'm gonna lose it.
[19536.51s -> 19549.96s]  My Wukong just solo ulted their Gragas.
[19549.96s -> 19555.52s]  On a good note though, they don't get any plates off of rifting, so it's not that bad.
[19555.52s -> 19557.76s]  Okay man, just push.
[19557.76s -> 19559.08s]  Like, dude, hit the minions.
[19559.08s -> 19560.08s]  Like, stop.
[19560.08s -> 19562.65s]  My bad.
[19562.65s -> 19566.21s]  Sorry, I'm wound up right now, Kennen.
[19566.21s -> 19567.21s]  Okay?
[19567.21s -> 19568.21s]  I'm a little wound.
[19568.21s -> 19570.39s]  Apologies if I if I griefed you man
[19572.21s -> 19574.21s]  It's fine
[19574.37s -> 19576.37s]  So it'll wound up it's fine. I
[19576.93s -> 19582.77s]  Just don't like when like stuff like that happens. I'm a perfectionist and it's my big place. I thought about this earlier
[19582.77s -> 19586.01s]  I'm a perfectionist. My biggest flaw is that like I will
[19587.09s -> 19590.33s]  Play the game a hundred percent correctly on like tempo and timers
[19590.33s -> 19594.79s]  But you can't do that because you got to remember to like your teammates or teammates
[19594.79s -> 19601.90s]  Like they're not just gonna instantly know exactly what you're what what to do
[19603.06s -> 19616.77s]  We win that guy don't just stand here and watch me die man
[19617.85s -> 19619.85s]  Holy shit
[19623.43s -> 19628.07s]  That is oh my god, if he if he had let me die there I might have screamed
[19629.27s -> 19631.71s]  Actually screamed out loud in anger
[19632.83s -> 19639.11s]  like dude is watching me kite these people within one inch of my life and
[19639.11s -> 19642.65s]  And instead of like helping or walking up and doing anything, you know what he does
[19645.11s -> 19647.11s]  He pulls a fucking gross score
[19647.45s -> 19652.29s]  My man just likes to watch
[19652.29s -> 19655.17s]  Something wrong with it. But you know, there's a time and a place. I
[19671.82s -> 19674.98s]  Don't actually want to buy pinks because I don't think we're strong enough that uh, I
[19675.58s -> 19679.08s]  Don't think that we're strong enough that I can actually even defend to the pinks right now if I'm being honest like
[19679.90s -> 19685.06s]  We should be strong enough, but we kind of threw our lead when I over forced the rift. So I
[19685.66s -> 19691.46s]  think I
[19691.46s -> 19701.26s]  Think we need to push this wave so that we can get tempo and move around the map prior
[19702.18s -> 19709.14s]  Sorry, I keep saying the wrong thing. Oh
[19709.90s -> 19712.20s]  That guy's dead. I have to ditch that guy
[19713.26s -> 19715.50s]  He's dead as fuck. Oh, I'm dead too. Maybe oh
[19716.26s -> 19718.26s]  I'm so dead
[19718.30s -> 19720.22s]  Yeah, that was my bad
[19720.22s -> 19724.82s]  That was my bad my bad my bad. Like we just got we just got ran down that's on me
[19724.82s -> 19736.88s]  Like, we had good positioning, but the jungler wasn't close enough, so this is my bad.
[19736.88s -> 19743.39s]  I also didn't expect to get fucking four mans, but I should've, right?
[19743.39s -> 19745.27s]  We should play for this though.
[19745.27s -> 19748.71s]  I wish I could type, I wish I wasn't chat restricted for a year.
[19748.71s -> 19754.71s]  Dude, I swear to god, I'm not even being mean, like, Riot was like, they chat restricted
[19754.71s -> 19759.15s]  me because I type so much macro that it gets on people's nerves, and they don't want me
[19759.15s -> 19760.15s]  spam typing.
[19760.15s -> 19782.33s]  Low key. Don't play for rifts. I need help guys, if you guys can help.
[19782.33s -> 19798.81s]  We need to clear vision on dragon. A year? Yeah, I get unchat restricted April 15th,
[19798.81s -> 19807.37s]  or April 11th or some shit. 2024. I've never seen it. It must have been like an actual
[19807.37s -> 19812.17s]  rioter or something. Like I've never seen an automated system give you a year chat restrict,
[19812.17s -> 19815.33s]  So, in my mind, it's gotta be like an actual, like,
[19815.33s -> 19819.52s]  like a rioter was like, Geronimo,
[19820.96s -> 19823.60s]  we know you're good enough to climb, but stop typing.
[19825.16s -> 19826.00s]  You know what I mean?
[19826.00s -> 19833.49s]  That's like what must have been going on.
[19833.49s -> 19836.19s]  And I'm like, okay, well, sure.
[19852.18s -> 19854.82s]  I mean, I didn't even know you could get chat banned a year.
[19854.82s -> 19856.14s]  What's weird is like, like I said,
[19856.14s -> 19857.46s]  I don't like say trigger words.
[19857.46s -> 19858.58s]  It's not like I tell people to like,
[19858.58s -> 19860.38s]  end themselves and stuff.
[19860.38s -> 19862.30s]  It's mainly just me typing like,
[19862.30s -> 19867.66s]  Go here do that do this like I type a lot right, which is obviously like if you type a lot
[19867.66s -> 19869.66s]  It can be toxic as well. So
[19873.04s -> 19875.04s]  Like typing a lot's annoying so I get it
[19886.51s -> 19889.47s]  We should be playing for baron side vision right now. Not
[19890.75s -> 19893.39s]  The vision we're playing with right now is bad. We should be playing over here
[19895.39s -> 19899.23s]  Like I want to play for baron vision, but it's a little hard to do that right now
[19904.54s -> 19907.98s]  Because you see how tom kenshin me or like transferring vision control around the map right now
[19907.98s -> 19912.06s]  We're playing this little support game of like hide the vision
[19913.50s -> 19915.50s]  Look at this fuck
[19915.50s -> 19918.94s]  Look at this motherfucker
[19931.28s -> 19933.28s]  Oh, he's so dumb
[19941.74s -> 19952.69s]  I still think he's dumb. How did I just take?
[19958.83s -> 19960.67s]  Tonight
[19960.67s -> 19962.67s]  I took my entire hp bar on a global
[19964.94s -> 19966.14s]  my bad
[19966.14s -> 19968.46s]  Dude, I really wish the malphite would group though
[19969.90s -> 19975.98s]  I get that he's like doing the thing where he's like, oh, let's you know split. I like his play was actually really smart there
[19976.78s -> 19978.38s]  The malphite's play I mean
[19978.38s -> 19980.62s]  Like that wasn't his fault that we got shit on at all
[19981.26s -> 19985.50s]  I just wish that he would group because if he groups up and hits r we win every team fight
[19986.46s -> 19989.18s]  Because right now our only frontliner is the wukong, right?
[19989.66s -> 19993.10s]  And the fact that wukong's our frontliner, we don't have the ability to play the game
[19993.10s -> 19998.50s]  Why did I get stuck on that? What the fuck was that?
[19998.50s -> 20003.66s]  Like that Tom Kinch getting to E forward like that blindly into our entire team and then
[20003.66s -> 20008.30s]  not getting punished for it might be the most like solo queue thing I've ever seen. Nobody
[20008.30s -> 20014.54s]  wanted to hit him because he was the tank, but uh, yeah, that's, we should still kill
[20014.54s -> 20026.51s]  him. You know, we can fight this guy. Oh my God. Jungler just come. Oh, we're forfeiting.
[20026.51s -> 20028.51s]  Oh, okay. Now that makes perfect sense, right?
[20030.51s -> 20032.11s]  Just come group.
[20032.11s -> 20034.59s]  Bro, Kennen, come group. Please, guys.
[20035.47s -> 20038.91s]  Like, I don't know why everybody's frustrated. We're literally still up in gold.
[20039.87s -> 20041.87s]  Please come group up. We just took an inhibitor.
[20042.99s -> 20044.99s]  Just- just come group.
[20045.95s -> 20048.83s]  Help me get vision on this dragon so that I don't- so we don't die.
[20049.79s -> 20052.75s]  Like, I need my team to actually walk over here to help me get vision.
[20052.75s -> 20059.80s]  It's really frustrating because I need the frontliners the wukong and the malphite to walk in with me
[20060.46s -> 20064.42s]  Because I'm a little fucking why I have a big gun, but I'm a big gun girl, right?
[20064.62s -> 20068.90s]  So I need I need these two guys to walk in with me these two big burly mountain men
[20069.90s -> 20079.74s]  So that I can play the game, you know, no, we don't push bot. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[20079.90s -> 20082.68s]  Mid no bot is worthless come in
[20083.34s -> 20085.74s]  My mouth lights pushing the wave that we already have down. I
[20086.42s -> 20088.42s]  Wish I could macro
[20088.70s -> 20090.10s]  I wish I could type some macro right now.
[20090.10s -> 20095.10s]  They're like, my team is so lost.
[20095.10s -> 20099.27s]  They're so beyond lost right now, it's crazy.
[20099.27s -> 20109.02s]  They're lost as shit.
[20109.02s -> 20111.14s]  Just do dragon, guys, just do this.
[20111.14s -> 20113.34s]  I'll start it for you, here you go.
[20113.34s -> 20114.70s]  I don't know why we're standing in a bush
[20114.70s -> 20116.22s]  waiting for them to face check.
[20116.22s -> 20122.26s]  Do dragon, guys.
[20122.26s -> 20124.86s]  I swear to God, you have to do everything in this elo
[20124.86s -> 20127.22s]  where you have to start every fight.
[20127.22s -> 20130.18s]  Basically, I have to start every fight, right?
[20130.18s -> 20131.82s]  I have to not only start every fight,
[20131.82s -> 20134.60s]  but I have to like ping my team what to do exactly
[20134.60s -> 20137.76s]  because everybody plays so safe in this ELO.
[20137.76s -> 20140.14s]  Why did my Malphite just stop his back?
[20141.84s -> 20147.61s]  Why are you all fighting?
[20147.61s -> 20153.13s]  Oh my God, please guys.
[20153.13s -> 20155.53s]  It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[20155.53s -> 20157.73s]  No, Malphite, you can't 1v9 that.
[20157.73s -> 20158.87s]  Just back off.
[20158.87s -> 20159.77s]  They didn't get anything.
[20159.77s -> 20161.57s]  They didn't get anything, we got dragon.
[20161.57s -> 20163.01s]  We're on dragon soul points.
[20164.89s -> 20166.61s]  I'm losing hairs.
[20166.61s -> 20167.97s]  I'm losing fucking hairs, man.
[20167.97s -> 20170.37s]  I ain't got many hairs to spare anymore.
[20170.37s -> 20171.37s]  We're out here losing hair.
[20171.37s -> 20180.50s]  It's like I'm babysitting, like this has got to be what a preschool teacher feels like,
[20180.50s -> 20181.50s]  you know?
[20181.50s -> 20182.84s]  Like, low key.
[20182.84s -> 20185.36s]  Like, preschool teacher just feels, feels like this.
[20185.36s -> 20191.68s]  This has to be it.
[20191.68s -> 20195.08s]  Like watch it, it's like watching a toddler, like you watch them from the corner, right?
[20195.08s -> 20196.72s]  And they're like eating glue.
[20196.72s -> 20199.04s]  And you're like, I mean, that's bad.
[20199.04s -> 20201.68s]  And then you tell them like, don't eat glue, don't eat glue, Timmy.
[20201.68s -> 20202.92s]  And he's like, okay.
[20202.92s -> 20206.20s]  And then like you leave them there for five minutes to go like do something to watch somebody
[20206.20s -> 20207.20s]  else.
[20207.20s -> 20210.82s]  Timmy's eating glue again, and you're like, bro, bro,
[20211.86s -> 20221.03s]  we just had this discussion.
[20221.03s -> 20222.55s]  And it's like not Timmy's fault, right?
[20222.55s -> 20223.71s]  Because he's a toddler.
[20224.79s -> 20227.23s]  So you can't be mad at Timmy because he's a toddler.
[20227.23s -> 20229.59s]  You can't, but it's like, it's frustrating.
[20229.59s -> 20242.36s]  It's like, God damn it, man.
[20242.36s -> 20243.32s]  Like what is, what is happening?
[20243.32s -> 20244.92s]  Like Malphite, just group.
[20244.92s -> 20247.76s]  My Malphite has a fetish with just pushing bot.
[20248.64s -> 20249.94s]  Bro, just group and hit R.
[20251.64s -> 20254.62s]  Bro, I know you have Bork.
[20254.62s -> 20255.62s]  Wait, you have BORK?
[20260.88s -> 20263.88s]  Bro, we need to be able to engage, we don't win through split.
[20264.88s -> 20265.88s]  Just group up, hit R, and we win.
[20267.88s -> 20270.88s]  Like, I've been controlling the ever-living fuck out of all the vision this game.
[20270.88s -> 20275.88s]  I feel like I'm doing all of this to control vision and shit, and it still feels like it's not enough.
[20276.88s -> 20277.88s]  It's kinda nuts.
[20277.88s -> 20283.67s]  Lowkey, it still feels not enough.
[20283.67s -> 20293.33s]  No, don't go bot, don't go bot, don't go bot, don't go bot, please don't go bot.
[20294.33s -> 20295.33s]  Hit me!
[20304.49s -> 20306.49s]  They don't have a ward. They don't know I'm there.
[20306.49s -> 20316.52s]  What, we're just not gonna ult that guy or what?
[20316.52s -> 20323.48s]  This is why
[20323.48s -> 20325.48s]  we listen.
[20325.48s -> 20327.48s]  Oh my god, I have, I actually
[20327.48s -> 20329.48s]  just, I'm so
[20329.48s -> 20331.48s]  I don't know what to say. Like I literally
[20331.48s -> 20333.48s]  pinged to come. Wukong didn't
[20333.48s -> 20335.48s]  use ulti. Twitch just
[20335.48s -> 20337.48s]  died in, and now he's AFK.
[20337.48s -> 20339.48s]  Oh my god. Oh my god, kill me in game.
[20339.48s -> 20341.48s]  Kennen and Malphite, can you guys do anything?
[20341.48s -> 20351.71s]  Like, bro
[20351.71s -> 20353.71s]  can we, can we, like, just go in Kennen, just
[20353.71s -> 20379.91s]  Okay guys, we get Baron here.
[20379.91s -> 20383.71s]  Look, the enemy team threw, go to Baron.
[20383.71s -> 20385.39s]  Please.
[20385.39s -> 20387.19s]  Please go Baron.
[20387.19s -> 20392.56s]  Please.
[20392.56s -> 20399.89s]  We get Seoul and Baron here.
[20399.89s -> 20403.29s]  Dude, I swear to God, these people are not real.
[20403.29s -> 20410.42s]  Bro, we do not need the Malphite.
[20410.42s -> 20416.90s]  I am a higher level than my jungler.
[20416.90s -> 20417.90s]  Push mid.
[20417.90s -> 20419.28s]  Guys, you gotta push mid first.
[20419.28s -> 20426.03s]  Listen, homies, you gotta push mid first.
[20426.03s -> 20428.71s]  You know what, fuck it, don't even go in, yeah, fuck it, push mid.
[20428.71s -> 20431.15s]  We're just gonna end the game.
[20431.15s -> 20439.07s]  If they go for dragon here, we just push, fuck it.
[20439.07s -> 20454.58s]  That's actually such a good macro call, not even joking.
[20454.58s -> 20461.92s]  Such a good macro call, actually.
[20461.92s -> 20464.96s]  Everybody just run, though, just run.
[20464.96s -> 20467.52s]  Don't ulti in, no, guys, we don't fight this.
[20467.52s -> 20470.42s]  Oh, I have cancer.
[20470.42s -> 20472.68s]  We're getting flanked, boys.
[20472.68s -> 20475.88s]  Dude, I have such high levels of cancer right now. You have no idea
[20477.08s -> 20479.40s]  Like high high fucking functioning cancer
[20513.02s -> 20515.02s]  Did you guys just kill the fucking gragas?
[20517.39s -> 20519.15s]  Oh my god. Thank god
[20519.15s -> 20521.15s]  Thank god. Just end the game
[20521.15s -> 20523.95s]  Please end the game. Please hit the fucking thing. Oh
[20525.87s -> 20531.47s]  Oh my god, walter white is like my hero right now, I don't even understand
[20532.03s -> 20536.83s]  Like I feel like every like I feel like what walter white felt like dealing with skylar
[20536.99s -> 20539.99s]  for literally three years, like this is outrageous.
[20539.99s -> 20541.99s]  This is what this feels like.
[20541.99s -> 20544.99s]  Like, I can relate to the show so much more.
[20544.99s -> 20548.36s]  Oh my god.
[20548.36s -> 20552.25s]  Like, dude.
[20552.25s -> 20577.52s]  Holy crap.
[20577.52s -> 20580.52s]  Dude, look at, just look at the, like,
[20580.52s -> 20582.52s]  look at, like, what's going on in the game.
[20582.52s -> 20591.50s]  Like, I don't even mean to be mean about this.
[20591.50s -> 20593.50s]  It's just, this is crazy.
[20593.50s -> 20598.09s]  Malphite, though, poppin' off.
[20598.09s -> 20601.09s]  Malphite poppin' off.
[20601.09s -> 20622.46s]  Like, what hero is this guy? Oh, he's literally Diamond. Why is this guy in this game? I mean, I feel I feel like
[20623.14s -> 20627.04s]  Confused now. I'm not even blaming the Wukong anymore. I don't know why this guy is in the game. Oh
[20628.82s -> 20637.41s]  He has inflated-ass MMR. Oh, he just has previous season inflated MMR
[20637.91s -> 20640.87s]  That's what this is because he was GM for three years
[20641.83s -> 20646.63s]  So the his MMR says that he like belongs here, even though he doesn't play like I bet you last season
[20646.63s -> 20654.28s]  only played like 50 games i can look right we just see like how many games he played yeah he played
[20654.28s -> 20659.00s]  he played like 50 games last season so like his mmr didn't really change he just got masters and
[20659.00s -> 20672.10s]  then stopped which is fine there's nothing wrong with that i just wish he would chill you know
[20673.86s -> 20681.65s]  like like uh not rage quit halfway through the game because like i said people's elo and shit
[20681.65s -> 20684.37s]  used to bother me a lot i don't i don't get bothered by it anymore because i realized it
[20684.37s -> 20687.95s]  It was cringe. I don't care about their elo and shit. What I care about is like
[20687.95s -> 20688.99s]  I just want them to play the game
[20688.99s -> 20689.35s]  You know what?
[20689.35s -> 20694.57s]  I mean, like I just want them to not rage not not like be absolute apes in the game and just play that's all I
[20694.57s -> 20699.01s]  Asked for I don't care if you're a diamond player pop player in the game and you're just like accidentally in the game
[20699.01s -> 20701.01s]  It's not your fault. I just want you to push buttons
[20705.35s -> 20707.51s]  What I'm doing wrong to have a 36% win rate
[20707.51s -> 20714.50s]  I can't see the link cuz just you'd have to give me your name and your server
[20714.96s -> 20721.85s]  How you guys doing? By the way, everybody having a good day. You guys enjoying the stream having a good time
[20721.85s -> 20728.25s]  watching me go bald in live like live time you guys are like oh look Geronimo's going bald live
[20728.25s -> 20733.69s]  on stream and i'm like yeah yeah it's it's rough hold on i'm gonna take my pants off
[20773.61s -> 20780.73s]  dude what i i fuck you guys they fucking like i get double swapped did you guys see that shit
[20780.73s -> 20783.29s]  they're like oh yeah the support could do it and then he banned senna
[20783.29s -> 20786.41s]  I mean, I didn't hover it. So that's my bad
[20787.37s -> 20795.46s]  God, damn it. I should have hovered. I was just like taking my pants off and now he wants first pick
[20797.72s -> 20803.99s]  Dude, what? Oh my god. I hate I don't I don't know. I don't know what to say. This is crazy
[20808.89s -> 20810.89s]  Today's Thursday, right? I
[20811.79s -> 20824.30s]  Am I losing days today's Thursday, right guys it is. Okay, cool. Ah
[20826.02s -> 20828.62s]  What do I play they have Xerath and is in
[20828.62s -> 20841.81s]  I mean, I guess I could just play Rakan. It's not a big deal. Let's see what their bot lane
[20841.81s -> 20850.40s]  is though. I actually have to see what their bot lane is to choose my runes. Sona? No.
[20850.40s -> 20881.03s]  Oh, they have an Ezreal? The fuck is their team comp? Um, okay. When you do this build,
[20881.03s -> 20889.07s]  what's the secondary supposed to be? I think it's supposed to be this. Or maybe like revitalize?
[20889.07s -> 20895.96s]  I just like unflinching so good. Oh, they have a support
[20897.18s -> 20900.12s]  Xerath so supports. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so I want I
[20901.12s -> 20903.28s]  Definitely want glacial here and I want
[20905.24s -> 20909.88s]  Maybe I take mr. Actually instead of armor because they have to poke champs and
[20910.80s -> 20920.24s]  I take this. Yeah. Yeah, this is good. Okay, that's not bad. Okay, what's that? I'll be right I need to get some more water
[20977.12s -> 20989.53s]  Oh shit, no, don't flag me!
[20989.53s -> 20994.17s]  Fuck man, I had to pee!
[20994.17s -> 20996.21s]  Don't fucking flag me for AFK because that'd take a week!
[20996.21s -> 21000.18s]  Can you not start with AD carry then move over to support?
[21000.18s -> 21003.66s]  I always fall asleep before the AD carry gameplay.
[21003.66s -> 21004.66s]  Wait what?
[21004.66s -> 21006.22s]  I always fall asleep before AD carry?
[21006.22s -> 21008.78s]  What do you mean?
[21008.78s -> 21011.30s]  Oh, you mean like start with my main and then play
[21013.90s -> 21015.90s]  Yeah, I played ad carry at the start
[21016.46s -> 21027.13s]  I should
[21027.81s -> 21029.45s]  probably
[21029.45s -> 21031.81s]  Play ad carry more over support
[21033.81s -> 21035.45s]  Later in the stream
[21035.45s -> 21038.97s]  Here, I'll play an ad carry game after this. I feel bad. Oh
[21056.90s -> 21059.98s]  It's Gragas. I thought it was gonna be Zerath, but it's Gragas. I
[21059.98s -> 21067.83s]  I don't want to fight too hard level one even though that that guy I should have gone in there
[21067.83s -> 21072.71s]  That's my bad. I want to I want to try and get level two here, even though I think we actually win level one
[21075.72s -> 21079.48s]  Who I got his bone plating. Yeah, I should have fought level one. That was my bad
[21080.52s -> 21083.06s]  Cuz we went very hard level one. I just griefed it
[21084.28s -> 21088.64s]  Like all I have to do there is go in on the Ezreal or the Gragas level one and they can't play the game
[21090.16s -> 21108.52s]  Right, it's not worth it's not worth
[21108.52s -> 21115.91s]  There's no way that I can not get E'd by Gragas there, by the way.
[21115.91s -> 21129.62s]  I don't know if I can flash W there.
[21129.62s -> 21131.50s]  Maybe we shouldn't be egoing, buddy.
[21131.50s -> 21139.86s]  This guy just fucking egos in front of me, like what?
[21139.86s -> 21159.11s]  Okay, I might have missed everything there, but like, you know, it's okay.
[21159.11s -> 21180.06s]  it's a little counterproductive when I take a tower shot to land a Q feels a
[21180.06s -> 21197.54s]  little counterproductive but hey I'm gonna back here just in case the enemy
[21197.54s -> 21211.23s]  Xin tries to gank mid dude I'm so sad I can't get boots I'm gonna wait yeah I'm
[21211.23s -> 21214.91s]  gonna be cringe I'm gonna wait I would never wait here normally but you know
[21214.91s -> 21222.27s]  what it's just it's so like it's such a big buy I I don't want to I'm now that
[21222.27s -> 21225.95s]  now that I've waited and beat cringe now I have to sit here and wait oh it's so
[21225.95s -> 21229.79s]  painful okay I'm on my way I'm sorry I guess
[21229.79s -> 21267.29s]  worth the wait nah not at all I got lucky but you know what's interesting I
[21267.29s -> 21272.49s]  never used the stupid dematerializer I think I should have like I should use it
[21272.49s -> 21276.73s]  on every cannon or some shit, but I just don't do it because I know the reason you're supposed
[21276.73s -> 21280.79s]  to use it is because it helps you push because you can de-materialize the cannon right and
[21280.79s -> 21284.77s]  just insta yeah so you're supposed to use it because it's like a really fast way to push
[21284.77s -> 21308.52s]  but it's also a I should not have W'd fuck I well not the Gragas anyway I fucked up I
[21308.52s -> 21317.81s]  shouldn't have W'd the Gragas I should have played it slower this guy's gonna die oh he's
[21317.81s -> 21320.01s]  He's gonna die, he put himself against the wall, gg.
[21322.01s -> 21328.28s]  That was my fault though, 100%.
[21328.28s -> 21331.20s]  Cause if I didn't W in, they can't kill us, right?
[21331.20s -> 21333.68s]  And Gragas probably dies to the auto attack anyway.
[21333.68s -> 21335.68s]  My thought process was, Gragas is snared,
[21335.68s -> 21339.40s]  so if I W here, but even if I don't get E'd,
[21339.40s -> 21341.30s]  I'm pretty confident I die.
[21377.79s -> 21387.02s]  Dammit, I tried, I was out of everything.
[21387.02s -> 21388.98s]  I wonder if I could've played that better.
[21388.98s -> 21391.82s]  Maybe if I could've weaved an extra auto in or something.
[21391.82s -> 21393.82s]  I don't know.
[21393.82s -> 21395.82s]  It's hard to know.
[21395.82s -> 21413.92s]  Alright, I'm gonna go mid here.
[21413.92s -> 21415.92s]  Oh, I can't.
[21415.92s -> 21419.80s]  Okay.
[21419.80s -> 21421.80s]  Well, I could go mid, but I think I want to sit bot for a bit and get some XP.
[21421.80s -> 21425.44s]  I think it's smarter to do that at this point.
[21425.44s -> 21427.44s]  I think we should push this.
[21427.44s -> 21448.00s]  I don't want to W in, because I know Xin's here.
[21448.00s -> 21450.00s]  Yeah.
[21450.00s -> 21452.00s]  That's why I didn't want to W, because I know Xin's here.
[21452.00s -> 21454.00s]  They were just making it so obvious, right?
[21454.00s -> 21469.47s]  Like, that it was like...
[21469.47s -> 21471.47s]  Sometimes, like,
[21472.47s -> 21476.99s]  Sometimes when people make shit too good to be true, it is too good to be true
[21478.55s -> 21481.67s]  Like oh shit, we're just gonna they're just gonna fight us here cool. Oh
[21483.39s -> 21489.70s]  Yeah, I gotta help him push my bed I'm playing sloppy
[21490.94s -> 21524.63s]  You just wanna see a cool trick. Watch this. She could push the wave and then just min max the back. Yeah
[21525.31s -> 21527.31s]  How cool was that?
[21527.31s -> 21534.24s]  She just pushes the wave and I did back next to the bush and she's just like oh, I guess I'll take the free ride
[21535.00s -> 21565.90s]  I really need level six badly like bro. I really cannot get level six right now. This is
[21567.36s -> 21573.23s]  Painful
[21573.23s -> 21576.19s]  Hey kill these maybe I'm six off this. No, I guess not. I
[21577.25s -> 21580.55s]  Was gonna stay mid there by the way and help the homie. I
[21581.67s -> 21583.51s]  Need to go mid
[21583.51s -> 21614.41s]  This is so awkward
[21627.83s -> 21635.66s]  Bro, help me
[21635.66s -> 21641.30s]  Bro, like you got to walk to me. Like I can't like my Eve is like here
[21641.80s -> 21643.80s]  I'm way over here
[21644.68s -> 21647.08s]  Right and my eve's like yo, homie
[21649.85s -> 21656.09s]  Like dude, i'm like we're trying to push the wave in for her and she's just not accepting to wait
[21659.45s -> 21660.81s]  And I can't w the wall
[21660.81s -> 21664.17s]  I mean, I guess I could w the wall because I was trying to walk around right?
[21664.17s -> 21668.73s]  I saw her in trouble when I was here. So I wanted her to walk towards here so I could e over the wall
[21669.69s -> 21672.41s]  That was my thought process e over the wall helped the guy
[21672.41s -> 21676.81s]  But he like didn't understand that and I just got shit on and it felt really bad
[21677.45s -> 21684.07s]  Both our solos are getting absolutely shit on
[21684.67s -> 21688.17s]  This is very bad
[21688.21s -> 21691.65s]  Because I don't know how to help our team at this stage
[21692.43s -> 21699.24s]  Like I'm just always behind on tempo now around the map in the wrong spot at the wrong time
[21699.96s -> 21723.62s]  This is so awkward. I
[21725.88s -> 21727.88s]  Have old we could kill this guy
[21727.88s -> 21733.88s]  I guess not
[21735.88s -> 21756.85s]  We could maybe kill the Xin if I sneak in here. Push the wave, push the wave, hurry
[21758.33s -> 21776.64s]  He's got to crash it. I mean this guy's just dead
[21777.56s -> 21783.88s]  My AD carry is gonna get fucked for it though. So I hope it was worth
[21784.82s -> 21786.82s]  Like my AD carry is gonna get zoned
[21787.34s -> 21797.24s]  it's really hard to tell if anything like that's worth sometimes because
[21797.24s -> 21798.72s]  I
[21798.72s -> 21802.80s]  Use my old before a dragon fight. We're gonna lose bot tower. There's just so many factors, right?
[21802.80s -> 21806.68s]  It's so hard and now I don't have words. It's so rough. I
[21825.76s -> 21828.40s]  Got the ignite off, but dude, I can't believe that Gragas lived
[21829.08s -> 21835.76s]  No, oh I had stopwatch. I have stopwatch. Oh my god. I'm the worst player in existence
[21836.20s -> 21837.44s]  I
[21837.44s -> 21839.84s]  Actually have the ability to live there. Oh
[21840.84s -> 21845.07s]  No, I should sell
[21845.07s -> 21856.59s]  my Magi's in shame. I actually just want the item so. Dude I'm so bad. Dude Gragas is low
[21856.59s -> 21869.34s]  key a good pick versus Rakan though you can stop his engage so easily. It's actually
[21869.34s -> 21938.64s]  low key a good pick. Bro. Nice. Not bad. I kind of want to back off here. You know what
[21938.64s -> 21944.48s]  feels kind of bad you guys notice that I just I got my uh I don't know if you guys noticed
[21944.48s -> 21953.73s]  this but I got my fucking I got like four assists just now but it was after I sold my
[21953.73s -> 21966.28s]  medjazz how fucking bad does that feel like actually oh by the way uh I wanted to ask
[21966.28s -> 21973.76s]  you guys what ad carry do you guys think is the most sought out for people to learn right
[21973.76s -> 21981.53s]  now like what would you say is like people want to learn this ad carry over other ad carries
[21982.33s -> 21998.60s]  what are you guys thinking my man says teemo okay makes sense got it depends yeah i'm just
[21998.60s -> 22005.56s]  trying to wonder like what um people would want to watch or what people would want to learn
[22005.56s -> 22008.92s]  specifically because i know everybody plays different shit but i know there's also like
[22008.92s -> 22024.20s]  popular shit, you know? Okay, I'm just bad. He's bad too. Listen, we're bad. We're bad
[22024.20s -> 22076.43s]  guys. Ooh, not bad. Jin Lucian, Xayah, Felios. Damn, is it like just that different? Like
[22076.43s -> 22090.88s]  a lot of people like different stuff? Because I've always just thought like, oh no. I guess
[22090.88s -> 22097.27s]  I've always just thought that people like, um, a lot of people really like like meta
[22097.27s -> 22102.15s]  ad carries or like really play makey ad carries right like jinx is probably the best ad carry in
[22102.15s -> 22107.99s]  the meta but i don't see a lot of people ever ask or like request to watch jinx you know what i mean
[22107.99s -> 22111.99s]  like jinx is not like she's not like a fun ad carry that people want to learn how to play
[22111.99s -> 22116.47s]  even though she is like the best ad there's like the people who are like oh yeah no jinx is boring
[22116.47s -> 22119.99s]  like i want to play jhin and like shoot people i want to play like lucian and dash around like
[22119.99s -> 22123.35s]  it's like so that's what i'm wondering is like what the number one ad carry is for like people
[22123.35s -> 22144.00s]  just like enjoy watching not bad though okay i think we could play an ad carry game i'm down
[22147.04s -> 22152.16s]  i i owe you guys an ad carry game i owe you that much for watching me play support for two hours
[22152.80s -> 22158.77s]  actually i think it was like two and a half hours uh yeah we played four games of support so it's
[22158.77s -> 22172.16s]  like two hours yeah i owe you guys for for that xayah or vayne xayah is fun to watch i do like
[22172.16s -> 22183.09s]  xayah you love jinx and kate oh there you go you're playing support top so you like to watch
[22183.09s -> 22188.77s]  watch how ad carries play it ah so that you can like better help the homies got
[22188.77s -> 22205.12s]  it got it we need eight wins I think from this point we are right now I think
[22205.12s -> 22214.92s]  it's eight wins to get to grandmaster I think oops because we're what 370
[22214.92s -> 22223.40s]  something right like three set 360 no we just won we're not 360 we're like 370
[22223.40s -> 22234.05s]  we're 387 okay so it's not updated but what is this stop so we need what seven
[22234.05s -> 22240.49s]  wins net wins to get to GM I think we can hit GM I'm a little less
[22240.49s -> 22244.41s]  confident right now about master about challenger but I think we can definitely
[22244.41s -> 22256.70s]  hit GM like I think I'll get stuck in gym for a bit unless unless the games
[22256.70s -> 22266.12s]  get higher quality i'll be stuck in GM for a little bit because the thing about the thing
[22266.12s -> 22271.96s]  about the games so far is like the higher quality the games get the easier it actually is to carry
[22271.96s -> 22277.32s]  if like uh if you're a decent player because the better um your teammates get which means that like
[22277.32s -> 22281.08s]  if you're at that like say like a challenger player will have a better time a challenger
[22281.08s -> 22285.96s]  ad carry player carrying in challenger if they get a lead than in diamond if they get a lead
[22285.96s -> 22291.36s]  if if that like I know that sounds weird to say but that's it's it's basically
[22291.36s -> 22294.36s]  just because like when your teammates are better they enable you better and
[22294.36s -> 22298.36s]  ad carry and all those other roles when they're being enabled it's a lot easier
[22298.36s -> 22309.34s]  to play the game like if I were to first pick Jinx in challenger MMR there's a
[22309.34s -> 22313.38s]  good chance my teammates would pick stuff that like lets me play Jinx right
[22313.38s -> 22316.34s]  not saying it would happen but there's like a chance that my teammates would
[22316.34s -> 22320.22s]  pick something that like they would pick like tanks or frontliners or some shit
[22320.22s -> 22326.60s]  Alright, or like Lulu whereas I if you pick him if you're picking Jinx first pick and like let's say you guys are gold average
[22326.88s -> 22331.12s]  Like your support might just literally pick like first time Vel'koz or some shit and you're like, well, this sucks
[22331.72s -> 22345.99s]  Dude, I swear every time I hear the end of this song
[22346.65s -> 22348.97s]  Does anyone know who forest within is? I?
[22350.61s -> 22355.53s]  Swear the guy talking at the end of this song sounds exactly like forest within
[22357.01s -> 22359.01s]  No joke listen to this listen to this
[22359.01s -> 22372.55s]  That guy who was saying he was DJing, that guy sounded exactly like, I don't know why my brain does that,
[22372.55s -> 22378.79s]  Homie sounded exactly like Forced Within. I swear to god, it's actually like perfectly.
[22378.79s -> 22381.59s]  Like if you told me that was him, I would immediately believe you.
[22381.59s -> 22388.71s]  This guy wants to join the Discord.
[22388.71s -> 22392.47s]  Oh, I'm nervous about this shit.
[22392.47s -> 22399.07s]  It is my support though, so like maybe we could join the Discord,
[22399.07s -> 22404.52s]  and like, work together a bit.
[22404.52s -> 22413.25s]  But I'm also nervous about joining discord calls with people
[22413.25s -> 22415.25s]  on stream
[22415.25s -> 22422.72s]  I don't know
[22422.72s -> 22424.72s]  I don't know if it's worth
[22424.72s -> 22426.72s]  Where would you put Ezreal on the tier list?
[22426.72s -> 22428.72s]  I think Ezreal is A tier
[22428.72s -> 22430.72s]  I think he could be S tier for solo queue
[22430.72s -> 22432.72s]  But he's hard, he's really hard
[22432.72s -> 22434.72s]  Ezreal is one of the hardest ADs
[22434.72s -> 22436.72s]  So I would say he's like A tier
[22436.72s -> 22438.72s]  Right now, if you're really good at Ez
[22438.72s -> 22440.72s]  He is very very very strong
[22440.72s -> 22442.72s]  But he's also
[22442.72s -> 22444.72s]  Incredibly hard to play
[22444.72s -> 22450.72s]  but he also is not weak in the meta so i'd give him like strong a
[22452.80s -> 22454.56s]  like above other a's
[22456.48s -> 22460.08s]  should focus on mage supports like brand xerath or engage like blitz nautilus
[22460.64s -> 22465.60s]  it depends on your elo and it depends on what you're doing i think uh engage supports in lower
[22465.60s -> 22478.56s]  elo are bad oh somebody dodged i think engage supports in lower elo are bad personally because
[22478.56s -> 22486.59s]  i think that uh you can be a really good engage player and it doesn't matter if your team just
[22486.59s -> 22491.23s]  gets caught over and over again or if you like make it engage and your team misplays right so
[22491.23s -> 22497.55s]  it's like if you want to play engage supports do it because they are better than other like
[22497.55s -> 22502.75s]  engage supports are better than mages but i think in solo queue mages are better to solo carry
[22503.47s -> 22506.83s]  so it just depends it depends on your elo and it depends on like what you're trying to accomplish
[22506.83s -> 22512.11s]  right because a lot of the time as a support player it's why i play senna right like i play
[22512.11s -> 22519.79s]  senna because i like being able to carry games as support that's why i like senna whereas like
[22519.79s -> 22526.11s]  if you're a um like if i like i can play almost every support right i can play nautilus i can play
[22526.11s -> 22530.91s]  play i can play these supports but the problem is is like i feel bad if like i get like it feels
[22530.91s -> 22534.67s]  really shitty to get people ahead and then have them completely throw their leads over and over
[22534.67s -> 22537.43s]  We're gonna then tilt and rage and shit. So it feels like dog shits
[22537.83s -> 22542.27s]  So it's nicer to just like give myself the opportunity to carry it rather than rely
[22543.23s -> 22548.86s]  100% on other people, you know, but I would say the number one thing is
[22550.20s -> 22552.14s]  Play what you think is fun
[22552.14s -> 22556.38s]  That's just the number one rule like playing if you want to win you can play meta
[22556.70s -> 22561.40s]  But the problem is is if like you're shoving your face and I'm trying to learn a meta champ that you just don't enjoy the play
[22561.40s -> 22566.94s]  I love you're never gonna actually be good at the budget the champion because you're you're like it's like you're working, right?
[22567.26s -> 22571.26s]  But the best way to learn the champions and learn how to play the game is to have fun
[22571.46s -> 22573.66s]  Because you're not having fun at some point
[22573.66s -> 22579.06s]  You're not gonna learn how to play because you're not gonna be able to put in the hours or put in the games and like
[22579.06s -> 22582.78s]  Be focused during the game. You're gonna be frustrated. And if you're frustrated, you're not gonna be learning
[22583.12s -> 22590.74s]  So I would say just play something that's fun. The fun aspect is gonna be way more important
[22590.74s -> 22597.64s]  Where'd my music go?
[22597.64s -> 22611.42s]  I'm surprised, can you guys even hear the music half the time?
[22611.42s -> 22614.42s]  I have it on solo that I'm not even sure you guys can hear it.
[22614.42s -> 22617.42s]  It's just like barely background noise.
[22617.42s -> 22642.70s]  Is this guy holding swap hostage?
[22642.70s -> 22653.49s]  Join call and I'll swap.
[22653.49s -> 22656.49s]  Dude, he's holding swap hostage.
[22656.49s -> 22669.32s]  By the way, if you guys do like the stream, don't forget to follow.
[22669.32s -> 22672.32s]  You can scroll down to see all my socials too.
[22672.32s -> 22678.00s]  like TikTok, Instagram, all that crap. It's all below the stream. There's like links and shit.
[22686.70s -> 22691.42s]  And, uh, you know, a man's got to eat. You can use your Twitch prime too. If you want,
[22691.42s -> 22711.92s]  you know, you're feeling it. I'm going to do a Kaisa game. He went Lux, but I kind of want to
[22711.92s -> 22718.89s]  play Kaisa. What was the voice? This is what happens when I get close to the mic.
[22722.33s -> 22726.17s]  I should put the mic in front of my face more than Mike's like over to the corner.
[22726.17s -> 22750.38s]  so the mic is like really badly directioned uh
[22752.78s -> 22760.41s]  this is a cut down game there's gragas always use ap he doesn't go tank he goes like ap
[22761.77s -> 22782.88s]  i kind of want to go last stands that's fine i should have taken ghost ghost would have been
[22782.88s -> 22794.62s]  so good this game you tried kate with shield bow it's strong yeah it's fun huh i love kate
[22794.62s -> 22801.18s]  with shield but it's so fun this would have been such a good ghost game i'm frustrated oh well
[22803.02s -> 22819.50s]  i like wasn't paying attention i i always wonder if i should go part of me always wants to go like
[22820.78s -> 22827.58s]  uh long sword three against thresh and xayah but with kaisa i feel like you're on really specific
[22827.58s -> 22833.82s]  timers with kaisa so you have to go like it's really important to go doran so that you can
[22833.82s -> 22840.30s]  get the q upgrade timer on the right you know like on the right timing i think getting the
[22840.30s -> 22848.86s]  q upgrade timer is just so big also this game i feel like i go bork this game second borker what's
[22848.86s -> 22854.62s]  ends if gragas is not ultra fed i'll probably go bork because i don't want to get what's end just
[22854.62s -> 22884.46s]  for gregas okay he started q oh diana's starting on wolves okay i need to get some coffee after
[22884.46s -> 22910.00s]  this game i'm getting drowsy i should have done the middle minion thing i'm so bad like i should
[22910.00s -> 22919.12s]  have legitimately just done the thing with the minion so when you know thresh starts hook you
[22919.12s -> 22943.47s]  can still play up right i can play up i can play aggressive i'm bad i should have just killed
[22943.47s -> 22951.50s]  the thresh this is really bad man we can't help we can't help because the wave the way the wave
[22951.50s -> 22960.09s]  going oh i'm so bad i fucked up it should be fine but i still like we're it it fucks us over early
[22960.09s -> 22968.60s]  game because they fucked up very badly like i i can't stress enough how badly they just fucked
[22968.60s -> 22976.36s]  up but it didn't matter okay that's that's happening apparently don't worry guys i'm the
[22976.36s -> 22990.72s]  best xayah player or kaisa player on the server it's me god i am just literally playing like dog
[22990.72s -> 23016.67s]  I pick Kaisa. I just felt like playing her. We got it back. We have to leave the wave in a bad spot
[23017.55s -> 23031.26s]  Maybe she can push it but like Wukong's here. So yeah, we just okay. We got it. Nice. Not bad
[23032.22s -> 23035.54s]  So we had to push the wave in there so that the wave will bounce back
[23035.82s -> 23038.00s]  But we had to do it on it was a really bad timer
[23038.38s -> 23042.48s]  Let me just say I fucked up the entire early game of this game like this games. I'm so bad
[23043.70s -> 23048.42s]  Essentially what should have happened was level one when they walked up when Kaisa and Thresh walked up level one
[23048.42s -> 23051.02s]  We should have killed them like I should have just straight up
[23051.42s -> 23057.98s]  Hit the thresh with the locks cuz thresh walked into our wave because wukong was level 2 ganking should just killed him
[23057.98s -> 23060.98s]  I griefed that and because I went for the Zaya instead
[23060.98s -> 23064.02s]  I put myself in a spot where I took like 80% of my HP for free
[23064.50s -> 23070.74s]  Right, which put me behind and now the entire fight was like harder because I was low and then we had to wait for the
[23070.74s -> 23072.74s]  Way, it was just it was really bad
[23074.34s -> 23075.46s]  Really
[23075.46s -> 23086.01s]  That minion actually just did that. I don't think we can kill this guy unless she can max range land a Q or something
[23086.01s -> 23095.96s]  But yeah, is Zarya the best AD right now? No, I think Jinx is better. I
[23096.60s -> 23098.08s]  Think Zarya is good
[23098.08s -> 23101.44s]  Her late game, especially with like paired with an enchanter, Zarya is insane
[23102.12s -> 23104.80s]  But I think Jinx is better for solo Q
[23106.56s -> 23116.30s]  Uh oh, I actually have to flash. That was a good play hook by that guy. I disrespected him
[23116.30s -> 23125.68s]  I might have to leave because Wukong can just go here and dive me.
[23125.68s -> 23126.94s]  I actually just have to leave.
[23126.94s -> 23128.78s]  This feels so bad.
[23128.78s -> 23132.40s]  You see how Wukong just used the plants?
[23132.40s -> 23134.20s]  If I stay, I can just die, right?
[23134.20s -> 23136.56s]  So I'm just misplaying all over the place.
[23136.56s -> 23138.00s]  I'm taking too much damage.
[23138.00s -> 23140.20s]  We're playing weak side right now, right?
[23140.20s -> 23144.40s]  What I mean by that is like, we know our Diana's top and we know their Wukong's bot.
[23144.40s -> 23148.12s]  So because of that, I need to play a lot less tradey.
[23148.12s -> 23150.92s]  I walked up and just let the thresh flame me for free and I missed two waves now
[23150.92s -> 23153.76s]  I need to not do that because if I don't miss these waves
[23153.76s -> 23158.08s]  It doesn't matter if we're weak siding because I'm not behind so it's it's just really stupid
[23158.70s -> 23166.86s]  Now what I do want to do is I want to go check and see if the wukong is like on our camps or something
[23166.86s -> 23177.40s]  Or if he's doing dragon or some shits. I should not have used the blast cone. Dude. I am so bad. I
[23178.36s -> 23180.36s]  Use the blast cone to just hit it
[23180.56s -> 23184.00s]  It's playing support man. It makes your it makes your brain smaller
[23184.00s -> 23203.18s]  Actually, like I swear playing support makes my brain smaller.
[23203.18s -> 23233.02s]  Oh, they're on dragon.
[23233.02s -> 23234.02s]  The Xayah's trolling.
[23234.02s -> 23235.02s]  I think.
[23235.02s -> 23239.97s]  Pretty sure I just freeze this, no?
[23239.97s -> 23245.61s]  With the Lux?
[23245.61s -> 23246.61s]  Yeah, she's just trolling.
[23246.61s -> 23247.61s]  I don't know what the fuck that was.
[23247.61s -> 23276.33s]  It took a little bit of damage, but she has to overextend now.
[23276.33s -> 23277.33s]  Not bad.
[23277.33s -> 23279.45s]  Okay, so the Xayah wanted to back.
[23279.45s -> 23282.57s]  The reason that I froze that was because Xayah wants to back, but she can't back until we
[23282.57s -> 23288.13s]  push the wave in or until they push the wave in right so it gives me time to kind of catch
[23288.13s -> 23301.93s]  up on my back timer with xayah because i'm you know a little bit behind in farm uh thresh
[23301.93s -> 23306.29s]  is definitely gonna go mid here he's either gonna go mid or he's gonna try and hook us
[23306.29s -> 23312.41s]  from the bush i think i'm gonna shoot my w through all the bushes here okay thresh isn't
[23312.41s -> 23318.53s]  in the bushes he's just mia yeah we don't know where he is this is awkward because i
[23318.53s -> 23323.77s]  I can't really walk up. I mean, I guess I'm almost sick. So I guess I could walk up
[23325.39s -> 23333.90s]  Yeah, there is okay we see him he is level 5 so it's
[23334.76s -> 23346.86s]  We could probably actually fight like if this guy lands a binding I might be able to just trade I just I am I'm dead
[23346.86s -> 23357.89s]  I suck. Honestly, I needed to my bad. I'm playing bad. That's on me
[23359.33s -> 23361.45s]  The locks is playing so good I needed to
[23361.45s -> 23368.41s]  uh w but then back up after the bind i'm just i'm mechanically shitting on myself right now like out
[23368.41s -> 23375.53s]  of my mouth just shit because i knew exactly what was going to happen when i used w in front of the
[23375.53s -> 23381.05s]  fucking thresh's face i was like here we go you know what i mean technically we're both six and
[23381.05s -> 23388.19s]  he's five but it doesn't matter because if i get hooked i don't have enough damage so now here
[23393.47s -> 23398.83s]  i'm gonna walk up and see if i can stop the xayah's back maybe maybe she's backing in a weird
[23398.83s -> 23408.97s]  spot yeah we stopped their backs huge okay now they're in trouble so they really needed
[23408.97s -> 23414.37s]  the back on that timer because they just want to fight right and because they just want
[23414.37s -> 23425.02s]  to fight they want to go back right no way dude fuck off i cannot dodge a hook right
[23425.02s -> 23434.99s]  now to save my fucking life jesus christ what is my movement man like tilting myself right
[23434.99s -> 23452.49s]  right now. I want to stay for this wave, but mid is Mia. Yeah, I can't. It feels so bad
[23452.49s -> 23457.89s]  because I needed one more wave to get double pickaxe so I can get my upgrade. Because like
[23457.89s -> 23462.53s]  normally you go noon quiver, pickaxe, pickaxe. And if you go noon, pick, pick, it gives you
[23462.53s -> 23465.61s]  enough AD to get your Q upgrade, right? And that's like the whole point. You don't need
[23465.61s -> 23470.17s]  Kraken. You just need your Q upgrade because your Q upgrades when you start bursting. But
[23470.17s -> 23474.37s]  Because I got hooked under the turrets, even though we got a kill, I had to back and I couldn't get my timer.
[23477.69s -> 23478.89s]  I'm so trash.
[23486.24s -> 23488.74s]  I need some coffee. That's what it is, man. I swear to God.
[23489.64s -> 23491.24s]  Coffee is my savior. It'll save me.
[23520.80s -> 23523.40s]  That wave actually just did that to me? Holy shit.
[23524.70s -> 23526.90s]  We don't actually have to do anything here, crazy.
[23539.16s -> 23540.16s]  Nice, well played.
[23540.66s -> 23548.27s]  Nice.
[23558.61s -> 23560.01s]  Nice, nice, nice.
[23561.31s -> 23562.11s]  That was a good 2v2.
[23562.11s -> 23574.24s]  All right, I got my q upgrade now we're chillin. Oh now we're hella chillin. Oh
[23575.64s -> 23577.40s]  Yeah, baby
[23577.40s -> 23583.53s]  You know what it is. It's like
[23584.41s -> 23594.50s]  I'm playing the fights too quick. I just got to slow down and like think I'm like too hyped up. I
[23606.21s -> 23609.09s]  Really don't want to miss this wave. There's a person right there. Oh
[23610.65s -> 23612.65s]  Shit let's go
[23612.77s -> 23615.89s]  Yeah, he's dead. I'm gonna go farm bot. Well that guy gets that
[23616.69s -> 23622.43s]  This locks is really good. I
[23622.43s -> 23640.28s]  I kind of want to oh, I can't get this plate. Fuck. What what that was BS
[23645.20s -> 23649.62s]  Okay, you know what? I'll just take my entire HP bar really quick on the turret. It's not a big deal guys
[23650.92s -> 23654.28s]  I'm just I'm that good at the game. Like I don't mean to brag but like, you know
[23655.00s -> 23657.00s]  Professional gamer over here like, you know
[23657.64s -> 23661.14s]  Gonna be want some lessons like I got you
[23670.70s -> 23672.70s]  Dude, look how big my shield is
[23673.54s -> 23688.50s]  Wait
[23688.50s -> 23714.13s]  you son of a bitch I mean she's dead but I got outplayed man motherfucker
[23714.13s -> 23734.95s]  alright they forfeited nice oh well I need to make some coffee I'm playing
[23734.95s -> 23754.73s]  give me a sec we're playing real bad I need some coffee nice though we hit 400
[23754.73s -> 23773.33s]  LP let's go so now we just need 150 more we need 550 I think 550 is GM I didn't
[23773.33s -> 23778.29s]  anything that game by the way i did nothing i could play another ad carry game that was fun
[23779.33s -> 23785.73s]  uh i'm gonna grab some coffee i'll be right back talks amongst yourselves boys i believe in you
[23787.09s -> 23790.37s]  you can look at my ad carry tier list that we've been trying to figure out how to do
[23791.33s -> 23902.00s]  enjoy i'll be right back grab some coffee oh fucking a all right i'm back let's go the fuck
[23903.68s -> 23905.68s]  Sweet
[23906.04s -> 23911.84s]  We back boys we back
[23918.47s -> 23925.25s]  Time is it five? Oh, I probably play for like another hour and then I gotta get off and make some dinner
[23927.05s -> 23943.10s]  Do some other shit, you know I'm saying where were we? Oh, yeah, we're making the tier list. Yeah, I think Varus is really good
[23943.10s -> 23944.70s]  eh, I
[23944.70s -> 23946.70s]  think versus good a tier cuz um
[23946.70s -> 23953.06s]  In my opinion, Varus is never really like a bad pick almost like sometimes he's bad
[23953.06s -> 23957.18s]  But I think he's just you can play him on hit or you can play him without E
[23957.34s -> 23962.86s]  Right, so he's got two builds that you can do based on the game and the team comp. His ulti is pretty much always useful
[23963.54s -> 23967.70s]  Like just having a stun like a root on a champion is always gonna be useful, right?
[23967.90s -> 23972.98s]  Then you have he's got very long range like engage. You can safely kill people with his ult and his Q
[23972.98s -> 23979.30s]  You can build him poke where like before objectives you can make picks really easily you can poke people out before the objective get him low
[23979.86s -> 23985.74s]  His lane phase is really good. If you're if you understand like how to play Varus his lane phase is exceptional. He also has
[23987.74s -> 23990.82s]  In the meta currently, I feel like he's just like a good pick
[23990.82s -> 23995.32s]  I don't think he's as good as Draven and Jinx for solo queue, but I do think he's really good
[23996.06s -> 23998.62s]  In general you can you can climb with him really easily
[23999.62s -> 24002.10s]  And then I put Ashe here, too
[24002.98s -> 24005.34s]  Maybe Ashe, I don't know who I'd put in front
[24006.38s -> 24008.26s]  Ashe or Varus
[24008.26s -> 24013.38s]  I feel like maybe Ashe or maybe Varus. I think Ashe is really underrated though. I think Ashe is super super good right now
[24013.38s -> 24027.38s]  I think Ashe is super good
[24027.98s -> 24029.46s]  because
[24029.46s -> 24031.46s]  Sorry, I'm trying to think
[24032.34s -> 24036.06s]  She's basically the same idea as Varus she's a little different, but she's the same idea
[24038.28s -> 24042.60s]  She controls lane phase pretty well right like her lane isn't too bad. She also has
[24042.60s -> 24049.92s]  always useful no matter what, so you always have use with ash, you always have use with
[24049.92s -> 24054.04s]  varus R, they just stuns, snares, etc.
[24054.04s -> 24057.66s]  She's also really good at being annoying in teamfights, you can take ghost on ash,
[24057.66s -> 24062.74s]  and you can just volley, sit outside their range, and basically solo people.
[24062.74s -> 24066.92s]  and she actually has decent scaling on her crit now, so you can go a bunch of builds
[24066.92s -> 24071.20s]  too, I think you could go bork-ash, you can go kraken slayer-ash into bork, or you could
[24071.20s -> 24076.76s]  go kraken slayer into ie or you can go kraken slayer into like whatever you can go shieldbow
[24076.76s -> 24079.96s]  ash if they have tanks you can go galeforce ash or you can just do a lot of different
[24079.96s -> 24083.24s]  builds on ash and i think she's really versatile you could also just go the on hit build if
[24083.24s -> 24087.56s]  you really want i i think the rageblade build sucks personally i think that if i was gonna
[24087.56s -> 24092.68s]  go on hit i would just be like shieldbow wits end into like bork or some shit if i was actually
[24092.68s -> 24102.73s]  gonna do that or shieldbow bork or bork wits or whatever but yeah uh i don't know ezreal
[24102.73s -> 24109.33s]  probably a tier two I said Ezreal is really gated by like skill so I don't
[24109.33s -> 24112.45s]  want to put him in I think if you could play Ezreal perfectly he'd be at the
[24112.45s -> 24117.41s]  top of S like he would just be above Jinx just best champion in the game if
[24117.41s -> 24120.73s]  you could if you could never miss a skill shot like 100% accuracy played
[24120.73s -> 24124.25s]  perfect like the champs insane right it's absolutely crazy how good that
[24124.25s -> 24128.81s]  champ is if you can play him perfect but you're like people are humans etc so I
[24128.81s -> 24132.05s]  think he's like an A tier pick in solo queue because you can get countered like
[24132.05s -> 24134.49s]  He's not blindable. You can get countered pretty easily by good players
[24135.17s -> 24139.23s]  People play like push comps people play dive comps like early game
[24139.23s -> 24142.73s]  I mean in lane and shit so like because Ezreal's lane is like not it's not bad
[24142.89s -> 24146.41s]  But it's very difficult to play Ezreal well in lane phase
[24146.41s -> 24152.09s]  You got to be good mechanically, and I don't think even like I've seen like challenger players who can't play Ezreal so
[24153.11s -> 24155.11s]  He's not easy
[24155.45s -> 24170.08s]  You know what I'm saying? What's up boys?
[24177.93s -> 24197.22s]  So I was gonna ban Kindred, but I couldn't find her
[24197.80s -> 24228.58s]  I hate Kindred. Yo, how we doing tonight? How's everybody's day? Okay, so this guy's picking Thresh again
[24229.26s -> 24285.70s]  Thresh into Rakan. Thresh is actually pretty good into Rakan. They have Xayah, Thresh again. Let's play Jinx. I like Jinx here
[24287.14s -> 24292.06s]  Even though it is against Thresh, Jinx is a little scary, right? But I kind of like her in this situation
[24292.52s -> 24304.44s]  See what runs. Do I want free boots? Nah, I think I want I want to be able to get early boots this game
[24304.44s -> 24311.99s]  because their team comp is like oh yeah their team comp is really really
[24311.99s -> 24320.99s]  annoying so I kind of want to get early boots I'll probably go presence of mind
[24320.99s -> 24331.00s]  although I think overheal isn't bad actually I'll go overheal so yeah let's
[24331.00s -> 24334.60s]  these runes look good actually let's do this
[24334.60s -> 24346.53s]  or this this yeah this is good okay I kind of like these this is good I'm
[24346.53s -> 24351.41s]  gonna use these okay I'm taking coins this game because they have Lissandra
[24351.41s -> 24357.57s]  and Pantheon and Thresh right so with Lissandra Pantheon and Thresh the game's
[24357.57s -> 24361.97s]  gonna be like really fast of like okay if they stun me I'm just gonna get CC
[24361.97s -> 24365.61s]  chained and I'm just gonna die like after a bit right it's gonna be like a
[24365.61s -> 24372.04s]  stun and a stun and a stun and I'm just gonna die so I'm like nah
[24372.04s -> 24400.44s]  Ah, fuck that shit.
[24400.44s -> 24409.87s]  Let's see if we can get this W, boys.
[24409.87s -> 24411.11s]  Let's see if I can not fuck up
[24411.11s -> 24416.41s]  the first three levels of the lane.
[24416.41s -> 24417.25s]  Got chat restricted?
[24417.25s -> 24418.91s]  Oh yeah.
[24418.91s -> 24423.64s]  It's for a while.
[24423.64s -> 24425.72s]  It's Riot's secret code to make it
[24425.72s -> 24427.50s]  so I can actually play the game
[24427.50s -> 24448.13s]  and climb without chatting.
[24448.13s -> 24449.73s]  Okay.
[24449.73s -> 24451.23s]  I should've warded this bush.
[24453.91s -> 24456.15s]  I was drinking my coffee and I didn't think about it.
[24456.15s -> 24458.49s]  But yeah, if you guys are against the hook champ,
[24458.49s -> 24463.39s]  always ward this bush.
[24463.39s -> 24467.03s]  Right here, you're gonna want to ward here early
[24467.03s -> 24469.31s]  against most hook champions,
[24469.31s -> 24472.37s]  because it gives you a very nice,
[24472.37s -> 24474.29s]  like they can't walk in here and cheese you,
[24474.29s -> 24476.27s]  they can't walk in here and cheese you,
[24476.27s -> 24505.68s]  so you just don't get cheesed by anything.
[24505.68s -> 24511.82s]  I mean, that's just, I don't even know what I just saw.
[24513.16s -> 24514.76s]  I'll be real, I don't know what the fuck just happened,
[24514.76s -> 24515.60s]  but okay.
[24516.82s -> 24519.68s]  Trying to push this wave as fast as I can.
[24519.68s -> 24521.44s]  Not sure I can actually get it pushed fast enough,
[24521.44s -> 24533.76s]  but we're gonna try.
[24533.76s -> 24539.82s]  It was close.
[24539.82s -> 24541.86s]  No, I'm gonna let it just push.
[24541.86s -> 24543.20s]  It's not a huge deal.
[24544.14s -> 24546.28s]  It was very close though.
[24546.28s -> 24547.54s]  We can just break the freeze, right?
[24547.54s -> 24552.44s]  Like, it's not a huge deal.
[24552.44s -> 24554.46s]  Are they supposed to win level one?
[24554.46s -> 24555.30s]  It depends.
[24555.30s -> 24557.76s]  I mean, Xayah's not that good level one.
[24557.76s -> 24561.32s]  Like, Xayah's good because she has her feathers, right?
[24561.32s -> 24563.00s]  But if you can't stack your feathers level one,
[24563.00s -> 24565.12s]  Jinx has more damage.
[24565.12s -> 24567.36s]  And they stacked up for my rocket.
[24567.36s -> 24570.08s]  So I got like, I full stacked my lethal tempo
[24570.08s -> 24574.24s]  and I just double AOE rocketed them over and over and over and over again, right?
[24576.66s -> 24580.82s]  And so when they finally all end, they were just behind in HP.
[24582.18s -> 24583.62s]  Also, Thresh missed.
[24583.62s -> 24613.11s]  He only had flay. Damn, that was so close, man.
[24614.23s -> 24632.18s]  Like, actually, if Thresh had died there, or not Thresh,
[24632.18s -> 24634.22s]  if Graves had died there, we'd just win the game.
[24648.93s -> 24651.05s]  Yeah, this isn't good. Oh, I'm going to get flayed. I'm dead.
[24652.57s -> 24654.13s]  Maybe. Oh, maybe I'm not dead.
[24654.13s -> 24655.73s]  I have to walk up like this.
[24657.33s -> 24658.83s]  It was a really bad fight by the way.
[24658.83s -> 24659.83s]  What am I watching?
[24659.83s -> 24660.63s]  What the fuck?
[24662.33s -> 24663.93s]  That was a bad fight because
[24665.73s -> 24668.71s]  we knew Graves was bot and we knew that he was going to heal
[24668.73s -> 24669.73s]  in the jungle, right?
[24670.53s -> 24673.81s]  So like my jungler already got outplayed by Graves once
[24673.83s -> 24674.53s]  topside.
[24674.83s -> 24677.43s]  You shouldn't ever take another fight like that bot side.
[24677.43s -> 24678.93s]  You should just take the win, right?
[24679.23s -> 24680.23s]  Like I rotated.
[24681.13s -> 24683.81s]  Now granted the Rakan should have been there to help kill
[24683.81s -> 24689.13s]  the graves. Like when I rotated, Rakan was still jacking off in lane, right? Like when
[24689.13s -> 24694.01s]  I was here, Rakan was like way down here. So the support should have rotated first,
[24694.01s -> 24698.13s]  right? Like I rotated, but the support should have been the one rotating. But again, he's
[24698.13s -> 24702.33s]  just a lot of the time you have support players who don't understand timers and how to help
[24702.33s -> 24708.53s]  jungle. Nobody plays for jungle. Support players hate playing for jungle in low elo. So it's
[24708.53s -> 24710.61s]  It's just not a thing.
[24710.61s -> 24716.63s]  So I tried to go over and help him, but I misplaced my traps a little bit.
[24716.63s -> 24721.37s]  And then the graves had a flash, but he got away.
[24721.37s -> 24725.97s]  And they tried to go in again when I was too low to actually help.
[24725.97s -> 24726.97s]  We just got lucky.
[24726.97s -> 24732.45s]  We didn't lose the game off that shit.
[24732.45s -> 24733.45s]  Kind of does suck though.
[24733.45s -> 24750.19s]  Zaiya is really strong now.
[24750.19s -> 24751.19s]  Not bad.
[24751.19s -> 24752.19s]  I should have.
[24752.19s -> 24753.19s]  Oh, I should have.
[24753.19s -> 24754.19s]  I could have killed her.
[24754.19s -> 24759.42s]  I suppose I could have killed the guy. No joke. I totally could have killed him
[24760.62s -> 24764.52s]  If I had warded the lantern as he tried to take it, I would have killed the Xayah
[24766.68s -> 24782.30s]  Cuz she egoed the lantern there. She egoed the lantern so hard if I if I had warded it she dies there
[24783.58s -> 24797.26s]  It's my bad. This game's really interesting because
[24798.60s -> 24800.78s]  The enemy bot lane is actually misplaying a lot
[24801.68s -> 24805.20s]  Like they're they're really really really misplaying these fights and trades and shit
[24805.20s -> 24812.52s]  but uh we can't abuse it because the graves has so much control of the game
[24812.52s -> 24817.08s]  right now that we have to basically play safe permanently at the moment and I
[24817.08s -> 24820.40s]  can't do anything to help my team it feels really bad
[24820.40s -> 24838.78s]  when my guys again yeah everyone see you look graves is bought again man this is
[24838.78s -> 24866.40s]  so rough graves is man I want to kill this as fast as I can we can fight these
[24866.40s -> 24883.54s]  guys to be too actually wait why didn't he just go in i don't know why he didn't just double you
[24883.54s -> 24889.94s]  immediately like the recon waited oh that tilts me like when she was against the wall here he
[24889.94s -> 24898.66s]  should have immediately w'd her because if he w's from vision there right and and she's against the
[24898.66s -> 24904.90s]  wall it helps us so much because then i can i can overlay my flame chomps on top of the uh
[24904.90s -> 24908.50s]  I can overlay my flame chomps directly on top of the Zarya
[24909.22s -> 24912.54s]  right as the fights happening rather than like having to
[24913.06s -> 24916.06s]  Work around the fight because Thresh is in my face type shit, you know
[24916.54s -> 24923.48s]  So we're just we're honestly just losing because we're not pulling the trigger fast enough
[24924.48s -> 24925.92s]  and
[24925.92s -> 24928.40s]  We can't play aggressive when we can pull the trigger
[24930.52s -> 24935.28s]  Right like we're losing because we can't pull the trigger fast enough and when we can pull the trigger. It's the wrong time
[24938.12s -> 24940.12s]  We do this right now. We get dragon
[24940.12s -> 24942.48s]  The bot lane backed we get dragon here. I
[24949.01s -> 24951.01s]  want to go I
[24951.29s -> 24953.29s]  Actually want to go
[24953.41s -> 24957.94s]  With the enemy bot lane didn't back
[24958.22s -> 24959.82s]  Okay, they're trolling
[24959.82s -> 24964.86s]  They lost an objective for free here. This is really good
[24965.56s -> 24968.60s]  So the enemy bot lane we fight this by the way, we just we can just straight-up fight
[24978.62s -> 24982.92s]  That right there is how you lantern. Are you mortal lantern by the way? Oh
[24985.30s -> 24993.34s]  I did that guy's so dirty. Oh, I'm dead. Bye guys
[25001.03s -> 25003.03s]  I didn't know Pantheon was Miya, that was my bad.
[25004.63s -> 25007.19s]  I was like going, I was too happy with warding the lantern.
[25009.78s -> 25010.28s]  My bad.
[25015.38s -> 25018.70s]  I can't believe the enemy team greeted that hard though for gold.
[25023.03s -> 25024.15s]  Like that's actually nuts to me.
[25031.88s -> 25034.76s]  No, yeah, the, the Xayah's egoing like crazy.
[25036.40s -> 25041.60s]  The problem is I can't abuse it constantly because like, obviously like I need teammates, right?
[25042.76s -> 25046.68s]  I can kind of abuse it like, uh, but it's much harder.
[25047.16s -> 25051.91s]  by yourself
[25051.91s -> 25055.11s]  because as you can see like i i'm not playing poorly, but we're getting like
[25056.31s -> 25058.07s]  We're getting shit on
[25058.07s -> 25060.07s]  Shit on the bad word. We're getting like
[25075.99s -> 25077.99s]  Oh, come on, man
[25080.85s -> 25082.85s]  They misplayed that so badly
[25085.67s -> 25087.67s]  but we're con just ate the fucking
[25088.95s -> 25090.95s]  Whatever. I'm not gonna blame her con. It's fine
[25091.51s -> 25095.03s]  I'm still sad about that though. They misplayed that so incredibly badly
[25096.47s -> 25098.47s]  Like so badly
[25098.47s -> 25103.69s]  It was just that like Rakan all-in'd the Thresh with his ultimate, but all he had to do there was
[25104.39s -> 25110.55s]  Use his E to come back to me and then play front to back afterward, but he's he sat there autoing the Thresh
[25111.47s -> 25115.95s]  But you don't need to auto him. You just need to engage and then I can maybe play on after right?
[25120.33s -> 25122.81s]  I probably could have double killed them there too. I kind of messed up
[25125.56s -> 25127.56s]  My team wants out
[25127.96s -> 25130.94s]  It's not it's it's silly because the game's not even over
[25130.94s -> 25141.59s]  like we actually can win this game so incredibly easily so easily if we just play it correctly
[25141.59s -> 25146.39s]  because their bot lane is really fucking bad i didn't want to be mean but i'll just be
[25146.39s -> 25161.86s]  mean their bot lane is really fucking bad well i'm dead they're still bad i'm just egoing
[25161.86s -> 25168.50s]  that was my ego i still stand by it i still think they're bad this guy's just playing
[25168.50s -> 25180.13s]  1v3 mid. The Thresh has not been mid one time. So it must be the top laner. I'm, I am so
[25180.13s -> 25188.00s]  frustrated right now with this game. Because I feel like we should have won so many all
[25188.00s -> 25192.24s]  ins that we didn't win barely, like one, like barely, right? Like barely didn't win
[25192.24s -> 25198.20s]  small ins. I feel like we should have won all of them. Like they, they didn't land
[25198.20s -> 25203.92s]  like a good all in once. Thresh didn't land a single hook once. And this is my Rakan.
[25203.92s -> 25215.50s]  He just tried to he just used his are to try and engage. I think nocturne is done mentally
[25219.19s -> 25221.19s]  Okay, so in games like this
[25223.09s -> 25225.09s]  Like this thrash is so bad. Oh
[25248.19s -> 25250.19s]  Let's go, baby
[25250.67s -> 25255.42s]  huge
[25255.42s -> 25257.42s]  That was so huge. Let's fucking go
[25275.12s -> 25280.94s]  Like I I'm gonna hit no at 15 because dude, I really don't want to lose to this thresh in this aya
[25280.94s -> 25288.78s]  Like this Thresh is doing the most the most ego shit I've ever seen and he's just getting
[25288.78s -> 25295.38s]  away with shit like right there Thresh walks up whiffs every spell and expects to get away
[25295.38s -> 25300.30s]  with that shit nah nah nah we win these we win these trust give me let me cook let me
[25300.30s -> 25307.30s]  cook I just need my team to let me cook a bit you know like we had a bad early game
[25307.30s -> 25309.30s]  Had to play weak side? Let me cook, let me cook.
[25310.80s -> 25311.80s]  We are chillin'.
[25343.86s -> 25345.56s]  Ooh, if I landed that, that would've been sick.
[25373.84s -> 25375.44s]  Thresh is top too, we can kill this guy.
[25383.58s -> 25385.08s]  C'mon guys, don't forfeit.
[25385.68s -> 25388.08s]  Guys, the game is winnable. Oh my god.
[25389.28s -> 25392.58s]  Dude, the game is- How is the Rakan gonna forfeit?
[25394.82s -> 25397.92s]  Dude, that game is so winnable, it hurts.
[25398.22s -> 25399.22s]  Ugh.
[25402.91s -> 25404.71s]  Like, dude, really?
[25407.46s -> 25410.26s]  That actually is so infuriating.
[25410.26s -> 25421.75s]  That's so infuriating man. That game was so incredibly winnable. Like look at this.
[25421.75s -> 25429.07s]  I did more damage than every single player on the enemy team. If my team just relaxed,
[25429.07s -> 25437.07s]  we win the game a thousand times over that game. Like the game is over. We have a Rakan,
[25437.07s -> 25443.35s]  a Rumble and a Wukong for me to sit behind. And we saw how bad their bot lane was, right?
[25443.35s -> 25445.35s]  I have quens for the only way they can kill me
[25445.67s -> 25452.73s]  Ever man, dude, I wish to god. I'm gonna report them all like these fuckers. I guarantee I get a notification
[25452.89s -> 25455.11s]  There's no way these people are not toxic
[25457.18s -> 25463.46s]  There's no way you in this like you just want out of the game after a fucking your team is just doing well
[25465.02s -> 25468.14s]  Nah, man, the score is 10 to 14
[25469.26s -> 25471.26s]  10 to 14
[25472.14s -> 25475.90s]  You have a fed ad carry
[25475.90s -> 25491.62s]  look at this dude we forfeited we were down 2.5k we had a better scaling comp than them
[25491.62s -> 25502.62s]  like we outscale them we have two dragons we outscale them and we're down 2.5k and my
[25502.62s -> 25524.58s]  My team rage hits forfeit, oh my god that's so gross, that is so disgusting, so disgusting.
[25524.58s -> 25528.90s]  Why am I in a game with this player?
[25528.90s -> 25540.70s]  I'm 412 LP masters, I was in a game just now with a 7 LP masters jungler, and he's not
[25540.70s -> 25550.13s]  on a smurf, this is not a smurf account, because last season this guy was D4, so he's not on
[25550.13s -> 25551.53s]  a smurf.
[25551.53s -> 25556.54s]  Why is this player in my game?
[25556.54s -> 25561.12s]  Why is this player in a 400LP master game?
[25561.12s -> 25562.18s]  Why?
[25562.18s -> 25569.87s]  Or rather, why am I in a Diamond 1 game?
[25569.87s -> 25572.69s]  You can go to his previous games, he doesn't even have good MMR.
[25572.69s -> 25578.43s]  Like if you look at these games, they're all like what, 100, 200LP right?
[25578.43s -> 25579.71s]  Why am I in this game?
[25579.71s -> 25583.35s]  Why did you put me in a game with this player?
[25583.35s -> 25587.51s]  Like this guy, I don't even care if he sucks, I'm more frustrated at the fact that these
[25587.51s -> 25594.27s]  players mental boom at the first sign of any negativity, look at this, they just give up.
[25594.27s -> 25598.07s]  First sign of anything negative, they go next.
[25598.07s -> 25602.55s]  Like I actually could have 1v9'd this game too, like actually, but I'm not allowed to
[25602.55s -> 25607.97s]  try and 1v9 because my team wants out of the game at fucking 4 minutes, or 15 minutes.
[25607.97s -> 25610.75s]  That sucks man.
[25610.75s -> 25613.15s]  The new system is trash.
[25613.15s -> 25617.27s]  I'm sorry, but the the forfeit 15 system is good. Sometimes
[25618.11s -> 25622.85s]  They should have a requirement that you have to be losing by X amount of gold for it to kick in
[25623.67s -> 25625.63s]  That should that should be it
[25625.63s -> 25627.35s]  They should have a requirement
[25627.35s -> 25635.64s]  You have to be losing by 5k plus for it to work at 15 like there needs to be something
[25636.44s -> 25640.44s]  Where there's a requirement because people are so stupid
[25640.44s -> 25643.96s]  Like that game was 100% ours.
[25643.96s -> 25650.48s]  We had 2 dragons, we're down 2000 gold at 16 minutes, and Wukong's 3-1.
[25650.48s -> 25651.80s]  We were down 4 kills.
[25651.80s -> 25656.96s]  Wukong's 3-1.
[25656.96s -> 25661.66s]  I'm literally insanely strong.
[25661.66s -> 25663.60s]  Even though we got weaksided, I'm still winning.
[25663.60s -> 25665.56s]  We just 2v2'd them bot side of the map, right?
[25665.56s -> 25668.60s]  We just won a 2v2.
[25668.60s -> 25670.76s]  Rumble's just like, like, ahhh.
[25670.76s -> 25672.20s]  Sorry, I'm just mad.
[25672.20s -> 25673.20s]  I'm mad.
[25673.20s -> 25679.52s]  Like, they need to require something other than 4 people, like require 4 people and a
[25679.52s -> 25685.16s]  gold lead or something, like that's so cancer.
[25685.16s -> 25689.66s]  That's so fucking frustrating, man.
[25689.66s -> 25692.38s]  Like I can't believe how bad people's mentals are.
[25692.38s -> 25695.54s]  Like, okay, I get it.
[25695.54s -> 25699.94s]  The rumble and the nocturne, I understand wanting to forfeit, okay?
[25699.94s -> 25703.06s]  Okay, they're having a bad game, they want out, they're raging, they need to get their
[25703.06s -> 25704.50s]  frustration, I get it.
[25704.50s -> 25715.92s]  why are we forfeiting when Wukong is 3-1? I have 7 of our KP, I'm the AD carry, I'm very strong,
[25715.92s -> 25722.32s]  I just got my mythic, we have 2 dragons, and Rakan's forfeiting too, I don't know man.
[25726.48s -> 25735.92s]  That's just frustrating is all. Like I'll be real, I carry this game every day of the week.
[25735.92s -> 25765.79s]  Like, every day of the week I carry those.
[25765.79s -> 25770.47s]  So apparently Riot is doing something about smurfing though, and I can't wait until they
[25770.47s -> 25772.61s]  do.
[25772.61s -> 25776.37s]  This is actually a really good thing that I wanted to talk about earlier in the stream
[25776.37s -> 25778.11s]  but I forgot.
[25778.11s -> 25782.07s]  Apparently Riot is doing something to make smurfing harder, because apparently smurfing
[25782.07s -> 25788.73s]  is outrageous right now, and I kind of think that they need to stop this too.
[25788.73s -> 25796.09s]  So there's a thing you can do in solo queue right now where you can make a new account
[25796.09s -> 25803.49s]  and you can duo with somebody on different accounts on a new account and your MMR doesn't
[25803.49s -> 25809.23s]  actually get like lowered.
[25809.23s -> 25817.19s]  So if you win a game, let's say you win a game, um, I think this is just him leveling
[25817.19s -> 25825.52s]  account but let's say let's say you win a game and in that game you duo with somebody in a lower mmr
[25825.52s -> 25830.00s]  right now when you duo in a lower mmr i don't know if this guy did this or not but when you
[25830.00s -> 25835.92s]  deal with somebody in a lower mmr your mmr is based on now the game thinks that you're in that
[25835.92s -> 25842.16s]  mmr and you can do it in placements so in your very first games for some reason there's no mmr
[25842.16s -> 25850.64s]  lock on placements so you can in your placements duo with somebody who's like bronze right and you
[25850.64s -> 25856.08s]  can play with them and then the game thinks you're still winning so it keeps amplifying your mmr
[25857.12s -> 25861.20s]  so when i'm describing this really poorly but essentially you can duo in lower elos
[25861.20s -> 25866.88s]  and the game doesn't know your mmr belongs in that elo because you're winning in that elo
[25866.88s -> 25872.40s]  the game can't figure that out for some reason the algorithm so when they stopped duo queuing
[25873.04s -> 25878.40s]  it still inflated them it still inflated their mmr to where it would be if they had solo queued
[25879.04s -> 25883.92s]  does that make sense and what i'm saying so it basically says that they went like 10 and
[25883.92s -> 25890.16s]  0 in their placements right so now they're in like master tier mmr from a brand new account
[25890.16s -> 25897.24s]  So now those people are in like D1 Masters MMR, but they played they've they've won in gold. I
[25899.45s -> 25906.25s]  Also don't think you smurfing should be so easily accessible
[25907.01s -> 25914.47s]  Like this guy's not a bad player per se, but I don't think he's a master tier player, right?
[25914.47s -> 25916.47s]  Like this guy's a rumble player on a new accounts. I
[25917.51s -> 25940.49s]  From that game alone. The fact he gave up tells me he's not a good player, dude
[25940.49s -> 25942.85s]  I'm I'm a heavy advocator for like
[25942.85s -> 25949.33s]  Like, Riot, you have to attach like a verification to your accounts.
[25949.33s -> 25953.27s]  I know Riot would never do that, but I'm like a heavy advocator for like having to attach
[25953.27s -> 25957.49s]  verification to play ranked.
[25957.49s -> 25961.88s]  I think it'd be great, honestly.
[25961.88s -> 25963.04s]  I think it would help so much.
[25963.04s -> 25977.35s]  If you get your verified account banned, are you done for?
[25977.35s -> 25978.35s]  Yeah.
[25978.35s -> 25981.21s]  You have to get like a VPN to play, other than like you would have to.
[25981.21s -> 25982.59s]  That's my point though.
[25982.59s -> 25987.77s]  Like if you get your verified account banned, right?
[25987.77s -> 25989.77s]  Like okay, that account's done.
[25989.77s -> 26011.94s]  Like I said, I don't think Riot would ever do it because it's too extreme and I don't
[26011.94s -> 26014.14s]  think Riot has the balls to ever do that shit.
[26014.14s -> 26015.66s]  VPN's only $5?
[26015.66s -> 26020.02s]  Yeah, but dude, are you gonna tell me that you're gonna buy it?
[26020.02s -> 26023.98s]  People who get banned on accounts typically get banned consistently, that's why they're
[26023.98s -> 26027.42s]  making smurfs.
[26027.42s -> 26032.54s]  So you're telling me somebody's gonna be willing to pay $5 for a new phone number verification
[26032.54s -> 26036.54s]  or whatever, every time they have to make a new account, they're not.
[26047.42s -> 26050.28s]  Not Yumi. Lulu. Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
[26051.62s -> 26054.12s]  Don't I have smurfs? Yeah, I do.
[26054.32s -> 26058.80s]  And I stand by all my smurfs should be attached to the same like account.
[26059.62s -> 26063.40s]  Like if you make a smurf, OK, this is what I think should happen.
[26064.40s -> 26067.40s]  You should be able to put all of your smurfs on one account
[26067.40s -> 26072.64s]  so you can make smurfs and you can add that smurf verification to an account.
[26072.74s -> 26076.02s]  But it kind of like battle.net. Does that make sense?
[26076.02s -> 26081.38s]  You know how like battle.net has all your accounts in the battle.net thing, but you can sign in to battle.net
[26081.38s -> 26085.24s]  I think that the way to make it viable would be like
[26085.42s -> 26089.18s]  You could put all if you didn't have a second phone number didn't want one
[26089.26s -> 26094.42s]  You could put smurfs up to like a limit so you could have like three smurfs or like two smurfs and your main account
[26094.42s -> 26096.90s]  right so you could have like three total accounts and
[26097.66s -> 26100.50s]  You you would have to like you could add those to the same like
[26100.50s -> 26104.94s]  Omega account, right? And that Omega account could be your verified account.
[26104.94s -> 26109.68s]  Now, if any of your accounts get punished on your Omega account, all of your
[26109.68s -> 26117.10s]  accounts get punished. So if any of your accounts get punished, all of them get
[26117.10s -> 26133.14s]  punished. Like, I feel like that'd be a good play. Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel
[26133.14s -> 26136.70s]  like it would work. Yo, what's up, Rush? I called you Rush. What's up, Ruff?
[26136.70s -> 26146.35s]  Uh, what do I want to play? I don't know. I don't know what I want to do here.
[26146.35s -> 26154.68s]  Double ranged, okay. I wish I didn't have cleanse. Cleanse is so worthless this game, like actually
[26156.36s -> 26158.36s]  Cleanse does nothing this game at all
[26158.96s -> 26163.88s]  I'm just down to some like maybe if the brand like tries to flash stun me or some shit
[26164.16s -> 26179.38s]  But I'm just like down a summoner. Alright boys
[26180.34s -> 26186.43s]  We got night blue three on our team. It's a throwback
[26186.43s -> 26260.86s]  Damn. Oh, we got him. I'm not gonna lie. I kind of looked like I was scripting. That
[26260.86s -> 26266.38s]  movement, like if I was watching the game, I'd be like, what the fuck was that? Like
[26266.38s -> 26272.38s]  my movement was real sus on that like that, that all in right there. That's some, that's
[26272.38s -> 26308.03s]  some, that's some sus movement. We can gank these guys. They have no, Oh, there's gonna
[26308.03s -> 26323.84s]  be a ward in here. These people have no flashes. Enemy bot lane has no flash. This should be
[26323.84s -> 26329.66s]  a free kill honestly. We just let these guys push in. They can't walk up and we just play
[26329.66s -> 26346.41s]  for that. Even if they try and 3v3 we should just win the 3v3 because we're stronger. Oh
[26346.41s -> 26364.82s]  this guy's just dead. Yeah that's... I need level 3. I kind of fucked my entire wave
[26364.82s -> 26391.02s]  here. Yo, can we push? Is there any way we can just push this? Ooh, nice. Nice, well
[26391.02s -> 26405.80s]  played. Nice job. My Lulu's fucking fed as shit. Oh, I should have gone free boots this
[26405.80s -> 26413.80s]  game. I didn't even think about it. Because, uh, I don't need Sorc this game. You know
[26413.80s -> 26418.76s]  how, like, the last game I told you I was going boots? I went boots for the, uh, you
[26418.76s -> 26424.92s]  the fast boot 2 rush for thresh i don't need that this game because we just went through like
[26424.92s -> 26432.84s]  faster mythic so i should have gone free boots for like more efficiency
[26440.12s -> 26448.60s]  can't understand i could just kill a man you can't understand i could just kill a man
[26469.11s -> 26504.49s]  i want to push this wave so we don't get like shit on i just kill a man you can't understand
[26504.57s -> 26517.45s]  just kill a man kill a man there is something you can't understand kill a man
[26517.45s -> 26559.06s]  hmm I could go back here but I don't see any reason to go back yet I think I'm
[26559.06s -> 26567.24s]  dead oh I misplayed that that was actually
[26567.24s -> 26571.24s]  really good by Lula cooldowns no you're fine man I wish I could I wish I could
[26571.24s -> 26577.62s]  tell him that he played it fine I messed up not him I messed up ah I feel bad I
[26577.62s -> 26579.62s]  I want to like say no, you're fine
[26579.70s -> 26585.63s]  Cuz that was my bad. I
[26585.75s -> 26586.63s]  Should have okay
[26586.63s -> 26591.07s]  So when I flashed and I was running away from the twitch right the second that twitch flashed on me
[26591.07s -> 26593.07s]  I should have instantly started autoing him
[26593.23s -> 26598.51s]  Like I and it was one extra auto like one single extra auto and it would have been fine
[26599.03s -> 26603.46s]  Why can't I tell her?
[26603.46s -> 26607.92s]  You know, I just choose not to type anymore
[26608.72s -> 26610.28s]  It's my choice
[26610.28s -> 26620.59s]  You know, yeah my choice
[26639.60s -> 26641.60s]  Okay, it's actually doing that, huh?
[26644.61s -> 26646.61s]  We win 2v2 really fucking hard
[26647.73s -> 26649.73s]  Especially with tier 2 boots, but I need uh
[26664.98s -> 26666.98s]  Dude, I am doing some scripty shit
[26667.54s -> 26674.06s]  I'm gonna be real
[26674.06s -> 26676.06s]  Dude, Lulu wasn't six
[26676.22s -> 26678.62s]  I thought she was six. I'm so bad
[26681.84s -> 26683.84s]  I wish I could tell her my bad again
[26684.08s -> 26686.08s]  I'm actually trolling
[26686.40s -> 26690.80s]  Like I ran out of mana because i'm bad and then I uh
[26690.80s -> 26698.22s]  And then I thought she was six so I walked up to like take tank the turret for a second, right?
[26698.22s -> 26702.12s]  Cuz I was like, oh shit, maybe I'll get like maybe we can kill this guy. Maybe Lulu has a spell or something
[26702.12s -> 26704.52s]  I just oh I played bad my bad
[26710.60s -> 26712.16s]  W that make sure
[26712.16s -> 26721.53s]  Echoes not there. I feel I actually just feel so bad because the Lulu is actually playing really
[26721.53s -> 26723.47s]  There's like the best support I've had all day
[26723.47s -> 26725.47s]  Like this guy's actually impressing me, right?
[26725.87s -> 26727.87s]  Like this guy's playing really well
[26727.95s -> 26760.56s]  And I'm just griefing
[26760.56s -> 26765.60s]  Lulu gave her life for me
[26765.60s -> 26772.36s]  Lulu gave her life for me boys. Can we get a a salute for Lulu in chat boys?
[26773.42s -> 26778.20s]  Do we get a salute? Can we get some love for Lulu?
[26779.90s -> 26806.87s]  She gave her life for the homie. Honestly, that was a really cool 2v2 by the way.
[26808.57s -> 26829.89s]  Oh, Nightblue smurfing it. What the fuck? Yo, kill that bitch too. Nice.
[26831.23s -> 26841.97s]  No! Oh!
[26841.97s -> 26846.77s]  If I lost that cannon, I would have lost my life in game.
[26846.77s -> 26878.71s]  I'm going to go BT second item.
[26878.71s -> 26879.71s]  We have Lulu.
[26879.71s -> 26883.47s]  So wait, what the fuck is this pathing?
[26883.47s -> 26885.85s]  I clicked to go bot and it paths me in the weirdest spot ever.
[26885.85s -> 26893.19s]  We have Lulu, so I could actually go IE second, but I think if I go BT, I'll be actually unkillable.
[26893.19s -> 26897.32s]  Like it'll be the greatest thing ever.
[26897.32s -> 26901.06s]  I actually still might go IE as I'm thinking about it out loud by saying we have Lulu and
[26901.06s -> 26906.18s]  not be stupid, but hey, I still might, you know, I still might go IE, but I don't know
[26906.18s -> 26949.70s]  yet. We'll see. Cause I took alacrity. So it's like, wow. No, I'm going to die. I mean,
[26949.70s -> 26958.50s]  I don't know why I flashed away. I'm playing bad. It's my fault. I think the game's over.
[26958.50s -> 26992.92s]  So I'm just, I'm playing bad. I'm like limit testing a little bit too much. Today. Nightblue
[26993.88s -> 27024.61s]  Nightblue help!
[27025.61s -> 27026.61s]  Help!
[27026.61s -> 27028.98s]  Help!
[27055.91s -> 27057.91s]  I'm surprised they haven't forfeited though. What the fuck?
[27057.91s -> 27060.91s]  Dude, how does this game...
[27060.91s -> 27062.91s]  Oh, I'm even more mad. You guys have no idea.
[27063.91s -> 27064.91s]  So, I don't...
[27066.91s -> 27070.41s]  It's 24-8, the enemy team doesn't forfeit,
[27070.91s -> 27073.91s]  but my team forfeits when the score is 10-14.
[27073.91s -> 27096.23s]  And we're only down a thousand golds. Sorry, I was
[27097.09s -> 27099.09s]  That was my bad. I was tilted by
[27099.89s -> 27105.48s]  You know, I was thinking about about how they weren't forfeiting and I was getting mad
[27107.00s -> 27109.66s]  It is a little interesting cuz like I said, they still can't win
[27110.16s -> 27115.08s]  So, I don't know who the fuck's heading. No, but it's probably echo. Well, no, I was definitely heading. No, but like who else
[27116.92s -> 27121.21s]  Maybe brand
[27121.21s -> 27123.49s]  Maybe Riven. Hey Riven's like yeah
[27124.09s -> 27139.16s]  They just get a thousand gold. All right, I should probably stop trolling. I'd feel pretty silly if we lost cuz I'm bad
[27139.76s -> 27144.18s]  After we like dumpster them in lane that hard. I'd feel pretty silly if we lost cuz I keep getting caught
[27144.70s -> 27163.56s]  All right, I should be unkillable now
[27163.70s -> 27168.14s]  Like I'm not even farming. I'm actually griefing. I
[27168.80s -> 27172.92s]  Should probably go make dinner after this game. I want to keep playing cuz I'm playing well today
[27172.92s -> 27177.52s]  But like dude, my brain is starting to go like like I probably need to go make some food
[27178.44s -> 27180.84s]  I'm getting the full ADHD brain experience going
[27193.61s -> 27196.17s]  So let's see if I can muster all my focus
[27200.63s -> 27203.43s]  Let's see if I can muster up all my focus really quick just for
[27204.23s -> 27209.85s]  Just push out and finish this game
[27209.85s -> 27212.33s]  We'll go terminator mode for the the end of this game right now
[27212.97s -> 27215.13s]  We'll muster up all of the uh, all of the focus
[27224.23s -> 27227.27s]  Demon mode engaged boys. God. That sounded really cringe
[27277.59s -> 27280.55s]  I'm, actually really impressed though nightblue played this game really really well
[27282.62s -> 27284.30s]  Like i'll be honest
[27284.30s -> 27286.30s]  My last like thought of nightblue was him
[27286.30s -> 27297.13s]  him being bad at League. He played this game really well. My man's gotten so much better.
[27297.13s -> 27306.82s]  Okay. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that.
[27306.82s -> 27310.10s]  Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody
[27310.10s -> 27322.14s]  saw that. Not one of you saw me flash after the echo. Well, did not one of you. Wasted
[27322.14s -> 27336.10s]  flash. No, that was assertive flash. An assertive dominant flash. Not wasted at all. They might
[27336.10s -> 27342.18s]  actually go for baron here we should look for this like they could try oh he's here
[27349.66s -> 27357.42s]  pretty sure the ribbons here too though yep i did not mean to do that i didn't mean to hit the
[27357.42s -> 27362.78s]  thing i accidentally hit the blast plants that was that was an accident it was a it was a literal
[27362.78s -> 27372.15s]  pure accident like i i did not mean to hit it i was like i know ribbons here i'm gonna wait for
[27372.15s -> 27377.83s]  yasuo before i go over or before i do this right and i'm gonna bait him and i just completely whiffed
[27377.83s -> 27383.67s]  every like i'm bad we'll leave it at i'm bad that's a good way to put i'm bad i'm hungry i'm old i'm
[27383.67s -> 27405.21s]  bald i'm bad nothing else to say short too short and mad yeah that was a pedestrian flash
[27406.65s -> 27417.18s]  it is she as well oh yeah it's it's a plethora a plethora of terrible things i still gotta go to
[27417.18s -> 27448.63s]  to the gym tonight too. Zed's bot. Okay. I'm a little nervous of like getting flanked.
[27448.63s -> 27471.06s]  Right? Their junglers could just like sit in places. Nice, we got top inhib. Not bad.
[27471.06s -> 27498.56s]  Yeah, I mean we just try and get mid inhib here. Whoa, let's go help our homie though.
[27498.56s -> 27503.92s]  I'm actually so sad. I'm playing so bad. Like I was playing so good at the start and now
[27503.92s -> 27530.18s]  playing so bad. It actually makes me sad. I was tanking for that guy. All right, let's just leave.
[27538.85s -> 27544.21s]  I don't wanna, I don't wanna throw the game for my, my teammates. Cause like I'm getting like,
[27544.21s -> 27582.02s]  you know, I've already died five times like a dipshit. Oh, where'd he go? We should just
[27582.02s -> 27597.94s]  push bot honestly. We don't even need this dragon. Fuck it. We should, I'm just gonna push bot.
[27597.94s -> 27662.64s]  not bad not bad at all I gotta give it I want to give it to night blue but I got
[27662.64s -> 27670.25s]  to give it to this Lulu Lulu played that game so good I gotta give it to Lulu she
[27670.25s -> 27713.10s]  played so fucking good like actually I don't know if she's still in here I'm
[27713.10s -> 27740.04s]  not a scripter she thinks I'm a no I'm serious she thinks I'm a scripter bro I'm
[27740.04s -> 27765.30s]  I'm streaming, dude, the homie thought I'm a scripter, you know, I'll take it.
[27765.42s -> 27776.09s]  My ego feels good.
[27776.09s -> 27778.89s]  Honestly, that feels good. That feels good.
[27778.89s -> 27784.98s]  Hi, Will, thought I was a scripter.
[27784.98s -> 27786.46s]  Dude, I'm not going to lie, though.
[27786.46s -> 27789.70s]  Some of those movements were sus as fuck that I was making.
[27790.22s -> 27794.38s]  Like I was like, I like turned on the fucking mental scripts for that game.
[27794.90s -> 27797.30s]  Some of those movements early were nuts.
[27797.30s -> 27804.52s]  Like, like, just like this tiny little tiny little movements I was doing early game and
[27804.52s -> 27806.02s]  lane were crazy.
[27806.02s -> 27809.88s]  Like, look at this, watch this, like this movement right here, right?
[27809.88s -> 27818.03s]  Like, look, I dodged that, right?
[27818.03s -> 27832.70s]  Then I walk up, cleanse the thing, kite down, like that, that movement is gross, man, look.
[27832.70s -> 27834.90s]  That was actually some gross ass movement.
[27834.90s -> 27835.90s]  I'm not gonna lie.
[27835.90s -> 27836.90s]  Look at this.
[27836.90s -> 27837.90s]  In the corner, man.
[27837.90s -> 27838.90s]  In the corner.
[27838.90s -> 27843.66s]  In the corner man, in the corner.
[27843.66s -> 27851.98s]  My brain was like, yo Andromeda, thank you man, yo you played really good.
[27851.98s -> 27858.82s]  I felt bad, I felt so bad because I was griefing, like I was, at the start of the game we were
[27858.82s -> 27864.86s]  just snow, I literally fucked up like 3 times during the really important fights and I was
[27864.86s -> 27870.18s]  like, oh no.
[27870.18s -> 27872.90s]  Yo thank you for the bits, can I play Kalista?
[27872.90s -> 27878.31s]  I can.
[27878.31s -> 27881.11s]  I'm trying to figure out if I want to play a Kalista game,
[27881.11s -> 27889.19s]  or if I wanna go make dinner.
[27889.19s -> 27890.95s]  There was one other movement that I thought
[27890.95s -> 27892.15s]  was kind of nuts.
[27892.15s -> 27894.35s]  I did a really good movement to somewhere,
[27894.35s -> 27898.60s]  I don't remember what it was.
[27898.60s -> 27900.04s]  Here's where I fucked up.
[27900.04s -> 27903.08s]  So right now, I should have just been,
[27903.08s -> 27904.96s]  for some reason my brain lagged,
[27904.96s -> 27907.04s]  and I should have just been sitting here.
[27908.04s -> 27909.20s]  I should have just cleansed
[27909.20s -> 27911.54s]  and then started fighting the Twitch.
[27911.54s -> 27913.22s]  For some reason I didn't cleanse,
[27913.22s -> 27914.88s]  but this wasn't like your fault at all.
[27914.88s -> 27920.00s]  I the second the twitch flashed. I should have insta cleansed the ignite and I should have been killing him
[27920.64s -> 27923.20s]  Like right now just like autoing because I can't get away from him, right?
[27923.68s -> 27926.72s]  But it took me an extra second. See how I I start fighting him now
[27929.79s -> 27936.19s]  Like I barely died. I wouldn't have died had I cleansed and had I just turned initially it was fine
[27941.82s -> 27946.06s]  And then like here I fucked up too because I went in and I thought we were six
[27954.50s -> 27956.50s]  Oh, I could have killed that guy
[27956.50s -> 27960.78s]  I should have gone forward one more. Oh, you know what? I should have done there
[27960.78s -> 27965.84s]  I should have gone forward one more auto killed this guy Lulu would have gotten six off of the kill
[27965.84s -> 27970.52s]  I would have used my speed to come back out then she could have ulted me. We could have killed the
[27971.56s -> 27974.56s]  We could have got the twitch and then we could have turned on this echo, too. Oh
[27981.82s -> 27984.34s]  This was a really cool 2v2. I
[27985.62s -> 27987.62s]  Actually thought this 2v2 was really sick
[27992.51s -> 27996.67s]  Lulu is a real one for this man. Listen, you're a real one for this one
[27996.93s -> 27999.77s]  You just took the death to save me.
[28004.86s -> 28005.70s]  Respect.
[28006.62s -> 28012.97s]  You're a real one for that.
[28012.97s -> 28019.63s]  That was so good.
[28019.63s -> 28020.47s]  Jesus was fun?
[28020.47s -> 28021.29s]  Yeah, Jesus.
[28021.29s -> 28023.33s]  You were the best support I've had today.
[28023.33s -> 28024.69s]  Like legitimately, you played better
[28024.69s -> 28026.63s]  than all the other players in the silo.
[28026.63s -> 28027.81s]  That was really good.
[28027.81s -> 28028.65s]  Like I was surprised.
[28028.65s -> 28030.43s]  I was telling my stream, I was like, yeah.
[28030.43s -> 28032.49s]  She's actually like, they,
[28032.49s -> 28034.59s]  I said she cause you're a Lula, I don't know, you know.
[28034.59s -> 28036.35s]  But I was like, yeah.
[28036.35s -> 28037.77s]  She's playing super good.
[28037.77s -> 28048.94s]  playing way better than all of my fucking teammates yo uh what time is it it's six man
[28048.94s -> 28053.26s]  do i want to do i want to keep streaming or do i want to go to or do i want to go get food and uh
[28053.26s -> 28061.64s]  go to the gym i can't like 24 hour fitness is not actually 24 anymore so i'd have to go soon if i'm
[28061.64s -> 28085.78s]  going to go to the gym but it is only like six hmm but i could just end on i could just end on the
[28085.78s -> 28093.19s]  hitting the like 400 lp mark and just chill for now right like we hit 400 lp we'll probably hit
[28093.19s -> 28102.47s]  gm tomorrow so i could just chill for now and then we can just hit gm tomorrow that's probably
[28102.47s -> 28107.27s]  a better idea because then i won't get mad like say say we get like like say we get another game
[28107.27s -> 28113.43s]  like this right like say we get another game like this where like we're literally winning the game
[28113.43s -> 28117.27s]  and my team's like no let's forfeit like that's gonna make me mad i was mad this is gonna make
[28117.27s -> 28122.07s]  me mad right like i so i'd rather just like get off on a good note like a happy note you know
[28122.07s -> 28133.74s]  like not be tilted gm tomorrow yeah i hope so i've been i think i can get challenger back this year
[28133.74s -> 28140.62s]  but we got to get to gm first i'm telling you i this elo is so miserable like master tier
[28141.42s -> 28148.22s]  is the worst elo i've ever played in in my 12 years of playing this game
[28148.22s -> 28159.78s]  game, whatever NA 300-400 LP Masters is, is literally disgusting. These are not real people.
[28159.78s -> 28167.94s]  I feel like half of these games we are playing with NPCs who quite literally don't even,
[28167.94s -> 28172.54s]  I don't even know what to say, they're bots. And they can't be real humans. They get mad
[28172.54s -> 28178.04s]  over nothing, they rage quit over nothing, they give up at 15 minutes when we're winning
[28178.04s -> 28187.91s]  the game these cannot be real people so i swear to god the game has to get better in gm it has to
[28187.91s -> 28196.55s]  get better there's no world that it gets worse like i i refuse to believe that because this is
[28196.55s -> 28210.28s]  this is the worst grind i've ever had is it bad to be a bot are you saying i'm bodist are you
[28210.28s -> 28215.08s]  gonna cancel me because i because i because i don't like bots i said it i'm saying it i don't
[28215.08s -> 28220.44s]  like fucking bots whoa okay i didn't need to add fuck you know what we're just i'm gonna get off i'm
[28220.44s -> 28226.36s]  gonna yeah that's it that's it for me uh i'm gonna get off boys i'm tired i need to go to the gym
[28226.36s -> 28231.96s]  before i run out of juice make some dinner uh i will be live tomorrow same time as today i've
[28231.96s -> 28239.16s]  been starting my stream at 10 a.m my time maybe i'll do it tomorrow at 9 a.m i don't know it's
[28239.16s -> 28245.96s]  10 or 9. Between there I always start my stream and so uh and that's my time so it's like seven
[28245.96s -> 28253.56s]  eight nine pst you're good at ad thanks man i i think i suck my goal is hopefully i can get
[28253.56s -> 28260.20s]  challenger back and then i'm not gonna play like i i just want to my goal is challenger so that i
[28260.20s -> 28266.20s]  can prove to myself it's a really stupid thing but i i want to prove to myself that i can still do it
[28266.20s -> 28270.32s]  it at 32 because 10 years ago was the first time I started streaming this year
[28270.32s -> 28273.60s]  right I've been streaming for 10 years this year and so I want to get
[28273.60s -> 28277.68s]  challenger because when I first started streaming I was in challenger and I want
[28277.68s -> 28283.00s]  to see if like after 10 years I can still do it and then I'm never gonna
