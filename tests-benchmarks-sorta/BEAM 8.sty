[0.00s -> 5.36s]  We want to take a moment to pay tribute to Barbara Walter. She was a trailblazing journalist
[5.36s -> 10.56s]  who spent more than half a century in broadcast news. Throughout her iconic career, Barbara Walter
[10.56s -> 15.20s]  shattered glass ceiling after glass ceiling, breaking barriers in an industry once dominated
[15.20s -> 20.08s]  by men, and paving the way for today's female journalists. She was the first-ever woman
[20.08s -> 25.92s]  to co-host NBC's Today Show, and later the first woman to anchor a network evening news
[26.00s -> 29.68s]  broadcast. In a tweet on Saturday, President Biden said, quote,
[29.68s -> 34.48s]  Barbara Walters has always been an example of bravery and truth, breaking barriers,
[34.48s -> 40.48s]  while driving our nation forward. Her legacy will continue as an inspiration for all journalists.
[40.48s -> 45.84s]  Barbara Walters conducted hundreds of interviews with newsmakers from the world of politics,
[45.84s -> 50.32s]  sports, and entertainment. She was famous for asking tough questions and sometimes
[50.32s -> 54.72s]  uncomfortable questions and forgetting some of the world's most famous people to reveal
[54.72s -> 59.36s]  parts of themselves the public had not seen before. Here she was on Meet the Press back in
[59.36s -> 64.32s]  February 1976, pressing then the Prime Minister of Israel.
[65.52s -> 68.96s]  We'll have the first questions now from Barbara Walters of NBC News.
[68.96s -> 73.92s]  Mr. Prime Minister, you have repeatedly said in your speeches that a militarily strong
[73.92s -> 78.48s]  Israel is necessary to maintain the peace. Now the Pentagon and the CIA have reported
[78.48s -> 82.80s]  after their military analysis that Israel is more than strong enough to deter any
[82.80s -> 86.72s]  Arab aggression. Were you able to convince Congress and President Ford,
[86.72s -> 91.60s]  those who are responsible for deciding military aid to Israel, that you are right
[91.60s -> 96.80s]  and that the CIA and the Pentagon are wrong? Well, first I would like to thank the CIA and the
[96.80s -> 105.84s]  Pentagon for complimenting Israel for its military strengths. But I believe that we need more
[105.84s -> 109.84s]  than compliments. We need hardware. Mr. Prime Minister, we've heard these
[109.84s -> 114.16s]  arguments now back and forth for a year. And I'd like to get back to my very first question,
[114.72s -> 118.80s]  which was how do you expect to have a Geneva conference reconvened without the PLO?
[118.80s -> 125.92s]  Can you give us any sign, any hope, any direction? Can you realistically be specific about one
[125.92s -> 131.04s]  new action that's going to break the stalemate, the same conversation back and forth that
[131.04s -> 134.32s]  we have heard from the year? Has anything happened in this week or are things basically
[134.32s -> 138.96s]  the way they were before you came to this country? I believe that there are basically
[139.04s -> 141.60s]  two options. How to move towards peace.
[144.32s -> 149.36s]  Incredible to watch her do her work. Barbara Walters died on Friday in New York City.
[149.36s -> 150.80s]  She was 93 years old.
[168.96s -> 170.34s]  you
