[190.19s -> 208.00s]  Yeah, that guy has GP bees
[215.50s -> 216.90s]  Jesus
[216.90s -> 320.74s]  Yo, it was a man. What's up dudes? Yeah, I mean we're hoping
[321.18s -> 327.57s]  We'll see man. We'll see
[330.25s -> 391.47s]  Fingers fucking crossed right? Do I ever actually?
[392.11s -> 408.17s]  I'm wondering if I I'm assuming I'm just playing a math
[462.38s -> 463.70s]  Yay
[463.70s -> 484.16s]  Yes, it's probably just me doing fucking. I'm probably just doing star guardian
[498.34s -> 502.08s]  Welcome to the room for the 27 months man
[503.50s -> 530.98s]  Appreciate it a lot dude. Thank you, and I could probably still go infinite team, but so I'm holding the solution
[531.72s -> 533.72s]  But I haven't seen any severs or anything
[534.80s -> 619.95s]  So it'd be kind of awkward, you know this guy's definitely gonna beat me that guys I
[621.03s -> 625.19s]  See why he hasn't lost that's he has five infinity team already. Jesus Christ. I
[626.31s -> 628.95s]  Was like man, why is that guy so strong and then I like realized
[629.55s -> 780.80s]  So I go to seven next rounds and then hopefully we can hit
[782.14s -> 806.32s]  Some shit I kind of like this actually because now we can make I
[807.60s -> 809.28s]  can actually make a
[809.28s -> 811.28s]  Guard breaker and I could also make
[811.76s -> 848.94s]  We go like guard breaker and math. I kind of want to just ionic spark, but I don't know if I should I need
[850.32s -> 852.32s]  an echo a
[852.40s -> 854.40s]  Niko or a round
[854.40s -> 857.40s]  I also could use an Ezreal. I need like a quick draw.
[858.40s -> 876.02s]  I should have kept that Lucian from earlier.
[876.02s -> 880.02s]  He's got a level 3 Blitzcrank and he's just so fucking strong it's stupid.
[880.02s -> 950.92s]  This is really interesting.
[950.92s -> 975.23s]  I guess I could go Spell Singer as well.
[975.23s -> 978.23s]  And we can just give the Shiv to TF.
[978.23s -> 1007.98s]  We can just do this for now too.
[1007.98s -> 1037.21s]  I guess I could use...
[1037.21s -> 1042.18s]  I could do Jeweled Gauntlet.
[1042.18s -> 1044.50s]  I don't know.
[1044.50s -> 1048.51s]  Could Jeweled Gauntlet this shit up?
[1048.51s -> 1049.51s]  See how it goes.
[1049.51s -> 1104.73s]  I need to like throw an item down
[1105.91s -> 1119.86s]  But I feel like morellos is bad. I guess I could just use hat or like I said before jeweled gauntlet could be good
[1119.86s -> 1154.02s]  I don't know. I could just roll on seven to train three star stuff. This guy has three Kaisa's though
[1154.54s -> 1156.30s]  This guy has one Kaisa
[1156.30s -> 1161.84s]  Kind of hard to three star Kaisa. I could three star Niva
[1162.62s -> 1193.10s]  They got some eight with fucking 20 gold
[1193.10s -> 1297.47s]  He already has MF and... dude Bloodscraping is insane.
[1297.47s -> 1357.48s]  Dude that gnar just merked me.
[1357.48s -> 1371.58s]  I did not position for the gnar and I got fucked for it.
[1371.58s -> 1399.18s]  This motherfucker.
[1399.18s -> 1404.18s]  Dude I wish I could get some thick front line leveled up.
[1404.18s -> 1458.63s]  That'd be cool.
[1458.63s -> 1542.07s]  Oh my god, another NAR.
[1542.07s -> 1544.07s]  Well, rip.
[1544.07s -> 1548.07s]  I was gonna go MF and then I decided to go Niko and then I just fucked it all up.
[1548.07s -> 1551.09s]  Oh well.
[1551.09s -> 1552.09s]  Oh well.
[1552.09s -> 1594.66s]  What time is it? 10?
[1619.15s -> 1621.15s]  What's up boys?
[1621.15s -> 1622.15s]  How's everybody doing?
[1622.15s -> 1643.42s]  Oh, I'll be right back.
[1643.42s -> 1646.42s]  Sorry, I'm still waking up. Let me give me one sec.
[1646.42s -> 1648.42s]  Sub sky oh
[1675.18s -> 1677.18s]  Okay, oh
[1679.72s -> 1682.80s]  Yeah, baby. I was gonna play on my man at the start, but dude
[1682.80s -> 1687.24s]  I don't know if I can sit through fucking eight minute queue times to get people raging at each other all day
[1687.58s -> 1690.28s]  So we'll we'll do some warm-up on this account for a bit
[1690.88s -> 1705.90s]  What a Mars account like D1? Whoa master?
[1713.22s -> 1719.62s]  Like my other counts like 500 this one's I want to say like I don't know the MMR is really awkward
[1719.62s -> 1725.26s]  When you get like low masters right like the mR super awkward, so I don't know what the mR is
[1725.26s -> 1729.70s]  But I know it's low masters. So like sometimes there's diamonds. Sometimes there's like hundred LP players
[1731.14s -> 1744.68s]  Somewhere between there dude. I I played some games off stream yesterday. I got up to like 400 LP
[1745.80s -> 1747.80s]  Then I lost three in a row
[1748.12s -> 1756.06s]  That shit was painful. I did
[1756.74s -> 1766.90s]  Into one of tenacity's games though. So that was fun. That felt bad
[1766.90s -> 1773.48s]  No, yeah, straight up it felt so bad. He was doing so good, too
[1773.52s -> 1780.27s]  Like I straight up just had a bad game and I felt I felt like shit. Look at this shit
[1780.27s -> 1782.11s]  I just dropped like eight deaths. Look at the shits
[1785.07s -> 1787.91s]  Like he was just straight up smurfing on the enemy top laner
[1788.67s -> 1793.23s]  And we all the entire team just like decided to collectively run it down
[1793.71s -> 1802.04s]  Like we all just got shit on
[1802.04s -> 1805.08s]  This was a really weird game because I feel like
[1808.17s -> 1814.45s]  That game was like the first game I felt everybody in the game was like actually high GM challenger, but they weren't right at that
[1814.97s -> 1817.37s]  There's a very weird system going on
[1817.87s -> 1838.99s]  Let's do a Cassiopeia game like I'll show you guys what I mean in a second. I'm assuming I should go this right
[1839.47s -> 1846.19s]  This is probably good
[1846.19s -> 1848.03s]  Or this
[1848.03s -> 1857.52s]  That's probably good, too. Oh well, okay, so yeah, look at this stuff
[1858.52s -> 1865.40s]  Like Nian Tonso is like he's been challenger for a long time, right? I don't even know who the fuck this guy was
[1867.24s -> 1876.12s]  Some random Senna player who's like not playing Senna now and then this guy was like trying to jungle and just like running it down
[1877.64s -> 1881.12s]  It was I don't even know it was the weirdest game that I've played in a while
[1882.80s -> 1885.60s]  Cuz like my 80 carry wasn't bad
[1885.60s -> 1890.60s]  Like this guy's clearly like on a smurf, but I don't know how good he was because he wasn't bad at the game
[1892.12s -> 1894.12s]  The enemy AD carry wasn't bad
[1895.08s -> 1897.08s]  This guy's also on a smurf
[1897.24s -> 1900.54s]  It was the weirdest lobby. It was like a bunch of smurf accounts
[1901.04s -> 1909.75s]  All playing with each other, but it was like a non-smurf queue. This guy was like the only non-smurf
[1910.23s -> 1925.23s]  It was interesting. Ooh, do I take ghost here or do I just I
[1925.23s -> 1939.28s]  I've had ghosts could be really OP versus their team with Cassiopeia, but maybe I should just take I'm gonna try it
[1939.92s -> 1946.66s]  No, somebody dodged cuz yeah, I don't I never know I never know what you take ghost ignite whatever
[1948.48s -> 1954.64s]  Cuz I feel like ghost with Cassio's feels like the same thing's AD carry right same idea where it feels really OP
[1955.20s -> 1966.74s]  Dude, there's so much drama going on in the league community yet again
[1966.74s -> 2005.96s]  by the way it's it's insane yeah I don't know man I I just I'm I like I like
[2005.96s -> 2011.60s]  looking at drama cuz like drama is juicy like I like looking at drama but
[2011.60s -> 2037.20s]  it's also like how are people so stupid yeah I'm getting like I I don't know man
[2037.20s -> 2043.80s]  my view on all of this shit is like I I guess I'm just not hardwired that way
[2043.80s -> 2051.40s]  I can't mentally wrap my head around being like excited the flirt with underage girls or like when like I
[2054.98s -> 2062.97s]  Just I never like had the want like it happens so much
[2065.05s -> 2069.45s]  Between like League streamers and non like just it's not even a league thing. It's just that we're in the league community, right?
[2069.45s -> 2070.77s]  So you see it more
[2070.77s -> 2072.25s]  dude like
[2072.25s -> 2074.61s]  well the drama is like a
[2074.61s -> 2080.77s]  A decent-sized league streamer who was like getting bigger or whatever like the adc streamer cookie roll or whatever
[2081.09s -> 2084.27s]  He was like somebody made a 90 page
[2086.01s -> 2088.01s]  90 pages of
[2088.41s -> 2094.38s]  Google Doc to basically like expose this guy for like
[2095.14s -> 2097.50s]  Talking a bunch like sexually to underage girls
[2098.14s -> 2103.54s]  Not paying his fucking like mods who do work for him and like other stuff and I'm like dude
[2111.74s -> 2113.42s]  Yeah, how man
[2113.42s -> 2124.14s]  Like just be a normal human. It's not that bad like I take it for me being a normal dude
[2124.14s -> 2203.79s]  It's not that bad. Sorry. I was distracted. No, uh, yeah, I don't know man
[2203.79s -> 2208.15s]  I swear to God people are just stupid as fuck people were idiots
[2210.13s -> 2215.63s]  There's got to be some psychological underlying issue with people's brains not working, but it is what it is
[2216.27s -> 2221.24s]  Huh, I've had this market account for a while
[2222.88s -> 2224.88s]  Oh
[2228.75s -> 2230.99s]  Dude, what is that tarik skin?
[2233.80s -> 2237.56s]  You see this we this tarik skin man. He's fabulous
[2238.60s -> 2240.60s]  Good day
[2240.60s -> 2242.60s]  My man, it's just straight up fabulous
[2256.40s -> 2258.40s]  People are desperate. I
[2258.56s -> 2263.90s]  Just can't like I don't think like I've been in the situation where I was like a really really big streamer
[2264.32s -> 2269.68s]  Like much bigger than he is and I got like I this is what I'm saying is like I understand
[2271.72s -> 2276.40s]  Like all of the crap that gets thrown at you like people will literally message you for no reason
[2276.76s -> 2281.48s]  Like you do have like fans that have like when I was at my biggest point
[2281.48s -> 2284.80s]  Like you have fans that are younger girls guy
[2284.80s -> 2288.76s]  It doesn't matter and like you just got a like I just never in my mind
[2288.76s -> 2290.92s]  I guess thought like oh, I'm gonna flirt with these people like
[2291.60s -> 2297.96s]  It made me like I don't even I wouldn't even I literally didn't even see them as like sexual in my brain
[2297.96s -> 2310.26s]  like it blows my mind and then the fact that like if you if you look at the
[2310.26s -> 2315.14s]  Google Doc or whatever the fact that like taco like I keep a taco whatever it
[2315.14s -> 2318.62s]  was literally talking to him telling him he was doing it like what he was doing
[2318.62s -> 2334.76s]  was wrong he was like yeah I get it right then he did it again dude the set
[2334.76s -> 2339.56s]  ulting the pussy that that I'll be on it that may be one of the funniest
[2339.56s -> 2343.73s]  lines I've ever heard
[2355.08s -> 2359.04s]  Like dude, I mean whatever you know, I'm not here to kink shame whatever gets people off
[2359.04s -> 2362.44s]  You know, maybe maybe maybe that's a fetish. I don't know
[2394.95s -> 2399.70s]  Safe and sounds either way
[2401.10s -> 2404.62s]  Don't worry we can not talk about the drama real quick. We can talk about
[2404.62s -> 2409.62s]  about how old and washed up wings of death is though.
[2426.75s -> 2432.83s]  I'm kidding.
[2432.83s -> 2436.31s]  Yo, did you see on a glider note though, did you see Riot?
[2436.31s -> 2438.11s]  There was like a Reddit thread or something
[2438.11s -> 2440.27s]  where Riot was saying that they're like gonna try
[2440.27s -> 2444.77s]  and do something about smurfing in the next few months.
[2444.77s -> 2446.29s]  I don't know what that means,
[2447.89s -> 2457.93s]  but can you tell us something involving wings
[2457.93s -> 2459.09s]  just between us?
[2459.09s -> 2460.81s]  Yeah, yeah, just between us and all the homies.
[2460.81s -> 2461.81s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, in chat, yeah, yeah,
[2461.81s -> 2463.25s]  nobody else say anything, it's fine.
[2463.25s -> 2467.54s]  Yeah, no.
[2467.54s -> 2479.22s]  What's up?
[2479.22s -> 2499.58s]  My chat ain't snitches.
[2499.58s -> 2500.90s]  When I was a teen, I made a montage of him
[2500.90s -> 2502.78s]  having breakdowns in my games.
[2502.78s -> 2504.54s]  Oh my god.
[2504.54s -> 2510.58s]  That's amazing.
[2510.58s -> 2515.18s]  Oh my god, that's amazing.
[2515.18s -> 2518.58s]  I feel like I need to pay you to see this montage.
[2518.58s -> 2521.82s]  Like, I will give you money.
[2521.82s -> 2522.98s]  Like, I need to see.
[2522.98s -> 2545.65s]  This is important to me.
[2545.65s -> 2546.21s]  Oh, I have.
[2546.21s -> 2547.53s]  Dude, you should see that.
[2547.53s -> 2549.25s]  I have so many rage compilations about me.
[2549.25s -> 2550.97s]  It's crazy.
[2550.97s -> 2567.39s]  So many I had a I had a villain arc for sure. I feel you just comes with like being a way extremer
[2567.87s -> 2581.92s]  But you players are not all mentally healthy. Let me let me tell you take it from me
[2589.05s -> 2592.03s]  And okay, I'd like to think I'm not a villain anymore
[2592.81s -> 2607.78s]  Fuck you. I really want this plate
[2614.04s -> 2626.46s]  Dude a nibbius roaming why is there wukong just sitting top by the way
[2626.46s -> 2645.62s]  That's actually hilarious. You know what's interesting? I feel like Tarik actually missed that stun.
[2645.62s -> 2672.54s]  I was kind of side-eyeing that, but I feel like he missed that stun somehow. I feel like this is
[2672.54s -> 2678.50s]  the easiest game I've ever played by the way. I'm on full autopilot, brain still waking up,
[2678.50s -> 2683.10s]  and I feel like they're just walking into me on repeat. I'm just killing them all. I don't
[2683.10s -> 2687.60s]  even know what the fuck's going on. Like they, it feels like the enemy team has
[2687.60s -> 2691.68s]  not like they didn't they didn't like understand we were playing league right
[2691.68s -> 2695.68s]  like they queued up and they were like oh yeah this is league. That's what this
[2695.68s -> 2700.48s]  feels like. This is what I imagine if like Mike Tyson went into a preschool you
[2700.48s -> 2722.42s]  know what I mean like this is what this feels like.
[2722.42s -> 2748.21s]  I probably could have killed those guys but I don't want to the chill. I'm assuming the
[2748.21s -> 2765.61s]  Wukong's gonna come bot soon. There he is. Dammit, I quenched late. I actually killed
[2765.61s -> 2775.29s]  both. That was a late quenched by me. I don't want to take the risk of coming back up. She
[2775.29s -> 2782.25s]  stuns me, they get one shot man. I should have killed the fucking guy though. The Wukong,
[2782.25s -> 2795.26s]  I just backed up too far and then I quenched the stun for no, like really late. Hi
[2795.26s -> 2797.58s]  Hi Jera, it was a man, it's a boys.
[2797.58s -> 2799.90s]  Good evening, good evening, good morning.
[2799.90s -> 2815.41s]  I don't know where the fuck you guys live, so good day.
[2815.41s -> 2826.17s]  Fuck am I watching?
[2826.17s -> 2827.53s]  Wait, that Wukong lived?
[2833.22s -> 2836.64s]  Whoa, bro.
[2836.64s -> 2837.48s]  Oh, and I'm dead.
[2839.60s -> 2841.76s]  Dude, that wall was BS.
[2843.60s -> 2845.88s]  There was a little hole, and then I flashed late
[2845.88s -> 2848.20s]  because I was like, oh, I could walk out the hole.
[2848.20s -> 2852.24s]  But I couldn't walk out the tiny little hole.
[2852.24s -> 2853.52s]  Mother fuckers.
[2853.96s -> 2862.63s]  I shouldn't have even been there, but like I'm stupid. I should have just pushed bot
[2862.63s -> 2866.47s]  I was like dude, that's such a bad fight, but I walked over to it. I was like I'm really fed
[2867.55s -> 2870.87s]  Honestly, I probably could have killed him if I didn't say if I like flashed the
[2872.11s -> 2876.94s]  Done Annie stuns the only
[2878.02s -> 2883.78s]  Like most over like I swear if they reduced Annie stun by like point five seconds. She would never get played
[2885.02s -> 2886.60s]  Like actually
[2886.60s -> 2890.04s]  The only reason to play Annie is her stun is just so OP
[2890.76s -> 2896.88s]  Cuz it's like a it's like the reason they changed Tarek so long ago where like when you have a point click CC
[2900.30s -> 2902.30s]  It's typically really broken
[2911.14s -> 2913.14s]  Okay, I'm just dead
[2913.66s -> 2915.90s]  Does Tarek not have ult leveled up at six?
[2921.47s -> 2923.47s]  He didn't level his ulti
[2940.62s -> 2942.90s]  Maybe it's maybe Tarek ult sucks
[2943.62s -> 2946.93s]  Maybe it's underpowered, you know
[2946.93s -> 2950.09s]  No, yeah, you must have mis-collect
[2959.24s -> 2962.56s]  Honestly, I'm just briefing. I'm like playing to aggro for like
[2963.56s -> 2966.18s]  Like I threw my lead because I was like, oh shit
[2966.18s -> 2971.06s]  I'm gonna walk over and help the homies. You never walk over and help the homies when the homies are getting shit on because
[2972.30s -> 2977.10s]  If you have like 900 gold or a thousand gold lead like like I did or whatever you don't want to do that because
[2977.78s -> 2980.16s]  You'll give MF a ton of kills
[2981.06s -> 2985.40s]  We're in a good spot now though
[2985.52s -> 2996.06s]  But I am still a little
[2996.22s -> 2998.22s]  Wait, Tarek- oh, I doubled his ult, then.
[3000.53s -> 3002.97s]  This Tarek does not know how to play Tarek, by the way.
[3003.63s -> 3007.13s]  He's throwing out his stun so awkwardly.
[3007.81s -> 3013.89s]  That's okay, though. I mean, I apparently don't know how to play Draven, so...
[3018.25s -> 3024.89s]  Can't really blame the guy.
[3024.89s -> 3027.29s]  I mean, you guys are doing dragon with no smite.
[3031.21s -> 3033.43s]  Well, it seems like doing dragon with no smite.
[3033.43s -> 3046.67s]  I mean, we could fight these fights, but...
[3048.29s -> 3052.24s]  It's like, painful.
[3052.24s -> 3054.24s]  We could easily fight these fights.
[3054.24s -> 3057.55s]  I think a lot of it is just like
[3058.39s -> 3063.07s]  Terrik isn't confident enough to walk up and stun right like that's that's what I'm seeing the issue is
[3063.43s -> 3068.15s]  He's doing the thing where like he's not he doesn't have the confidence to actually walk up since he's a melee champ
[3068.99s -> 3074.13s]  So he's walking up and like taking half his health
[3075.09s -> 3077.09s]  And it's making him nervous
[3077.33s -> 3079.33s]  It happens a lot with players
[3079.81s -> 3082.95s]  Who are very melee champ centric?
[3083.89s -> 3086.89s]  Because melee supports are actually pretty risky or they're pretty scary rather
[3086.89s -> 3102.28s]  Oh, he's totally dead. Oh, no, I'm not but yeah, melee supports are scary to play
[3102.80s -> 3104.80s]  Because you have to know
[3105.22s -> 3108.16s]  When you can get a kill by going in because you're gonna take damage, right?
[3109.86s -> 3112.44s]  That's just like the nature of melee supports
[3116.57s -> 3118.41s]  nice
[3118.41s -> 3120.41s]  We're coming back in a bit. Not bad
[3121.03s -> 3124.55s]  We threw a little bit early, but yeah, we're starting to get it back. We're chillin
[3127.18s -> 3129.18s]  Tarek's a never-goon I
[3129.46s -> 3135.62s]  I'm always confused by Tarek because he feels like such a good champion like the champion itself feels broken as shit
[3137.50s -> 3140.30s]  Like whatever I whenever I see Tarek, I think to myself like
[3142.10s -> 3147.94s]  He's either unkillably like super OP or they're like
[3149.62s -> 3151.22s]  0 and 10
[3151.22s -> 3155.10s]  There's no in between right like they either know how to play Tarek or they don't is what it feels like
[3155.10s -> 3172.60s]  Oh, you I mean yeah, you are wrong. Tariq actually requires mechanics
[3174.20s -> 3176.20s]  That's actually true
[3176.48s -> 3182.00s]  Where's like most supports like not always doesn't have mechanics, you know and like what's crank doesn't have mechanics
[3182.00s -> 3185.76s]  They just hit their button and if it if it works, they they get a kill
[3188.08s -> 3207.65s]  Where's like Tariq after you stun there is like stuff you have to do that does make sense or block
[3208.21s -> 3212.78s]  Do you think? Oh, I'm gonna die
[3214.82s -> 3216.02s]  Oh, thank god.
[3219.05s -> 3221.25s]  Do you think Terak's one of the harder supports?
[3221.25s -> 3222.65s]  I think he's pretty hard.
[3225.33s -> 3226.23s]  Like, I don't think he's...
[3226.23s -> 3228.43s]  Well, I mean, he's harder than the other supports.
[3228.43s -> 3229.43s]  Like, I think, like...
[3229.63s -> 3231.93s]  I don't think there's a single support that's hard.
[3232.83s -> 3235.23s]  I know, I'm toxic for that, but...
[3236.03s -> 3237.03s]  I stand by it.
[3241.39s -> 3242.09s]  Whoa.
[3256.20s -> 3257.10s]  I mean, I'm just gonna die.
[3257.10s -> 3258.60s]  I'm not gonna try and flash.
[3258.90s -> 3259.70s]  I don't think...
[3259.80s -> 3261.40s]  I should have just flashed over,
[3261.60s -> 3263.80s]  but I kinda got baited by the Terakult.
[3263.80s -> 3265.40s]  I wanted to see, like, if I could fight.
[3265.40s -> 3270.00s]  But there's too much to see. I was like, oh, he's halting me. Let's go. I
[3271.90s -> 3278.94s]  Can tell this is a really low elo game because there's so much random deaths like I'm falling victim to like I'm auto-piloting and
[3279.26s -> 3282.98s]  Like I'm not thinking and I'm just talking to you guys and I'm just dying for free
[3283.26s -> 3286.98s]  But it's like there's so many people just dying for free. It's hilarious
[3287.62s -> 3290.66s]  Thresh Thresh isn't actually that far so
[3290.66s -> 3296.78s]  So a lot of people think like Thresh mechanically is very difficult because he has harder than
[3296.78s -> 3300.26s]  the other supports, but he's not actually that hard.
[3300.26s -> 3308.66s]  He's like once you learn the Thresh combos, he's pretty much a very upfront champion.
[3308.66s -> 3321.84s]  Yeah, like Lantern for example is one of the most broken things to ever be put in
[3321.84s -> 3324.48s]  League and everybody fucks it up.
[3324.48s -> 3329.04s]  People will just mess up Lantern because they'll throw it for souls or they'll mess up.
[3329.04s -> 3335.78s]  You can literally just hold Lantern perma and your AD carry can walk up, auto the turret
[3335.78s -> 3345.70s]  and you literally, they literally can't play the game after that.
[3345.70s -> 3350.92s]  Like the enemy team I mean, because there's nothing they can do to stop it.
[3350.92s -> 3353.84s]  We can totally fight this by the way.
[3353.84s -> 3357.88s]  So I've done that before where my Thresh, I know I have a good, hold on let me win
[3357.88s -> 3359.68s]  this team fight really quick.
[3360.36s -> 3383.82s]  Give me a sec.
[3383.82s -> 3389.94s]  Okay, cool. So I had to win that teamfight real quick. Okay, so as I was saying, there's a lot more to Thresh than
[3391.26s -> 3393.26s]  people think, right?
[3393.30s -> 3397.22s]  It's essentially, people over complicate like what he needs to do.
[3397.50s -> 3403.02s]  So it's like Thresh is a very basic, like when you see Thresh in pro play, you don't ever see like what you do,
[3403.02s -> 3405.02s]  but it's very rare that you see like the sick
[3405.18s -> 3410.38s]  perma-hooking like, oh my god, like it's mainly like they pick him for like Lantern.
[3411.54s -> 3412.68s]  Throw down
[3412.68s -> 3419.40s]  Like when they when they pick Thresh and high you know, he's not picked to be the god tier like always landing permacicy hooks like flay god
[3419.40s -> 3422.36s]  like he's picked to like shut down engage and
[3423.72s -> 3425.52s]  remove
[3425.52s -> 3432.52s]  Kill threat to your carries. That's all he's picked for that's he's literally just an EW bot
[3434.97s -> 3439.97s]  Armor stacking. I mean, yeah, the armor thing on Thresh is nice, but it's I wouldn't say it's like OP on his kit
[3440.61s -> 3446.07s]  It just makes him like not died to 80 carries in two seconds
[3446.07s -> 3453.96s]  What has happened?
[3453.96s -> 3462.18s]  But I instantly know I'm playing with a good Thresh player when I can walk up to the turret.
[3462.18s -> 3477.14s]  When I can walk up to the turret and the thre- Sorry, I was trying to think and talk at the
[3477.14s -> 3478.26s]  same time.
[3478.26s -> 3481.18s]  When I can walk up to the turret, my Thresh player won't walk up and auto the turret with
[3481.18s -> 3482.18s]  me.
[3482.18s -> 3484.46s]  That's like the sign of a good Thresh player.
[3484.46s -> 3487.46s]  When we don't know where the enemy is, and instead of walking up and trying to
[3487.46s -> 3491.38s]  hit the turret to like help you kill the turret, they'll stand in the back and literally
[3491.38s -> 3500.82s]  just sit there and wait and hold lantern until they just hold their lantern until you get ganked,
[3500.82s -> 3507.93s]  essentially. And that's why, like I said, I just personally don't think Thresh is mechanics
[3507.93s -> 3512.73s]  as hard as people think. I do think he's very knowledge-based. I think Thresh has high
[3512.73s -> 3519.09s]  knowledge caps, where if you're playing, I don't know, Lulu, your skill is basically
[3519.09s -> 3525.89s]  like do i w your decision-making lulu is literally do i w to speed or do i w to cc right like that's
[3525.89s -> 3531.73s]  your that's your decision-making so it's like obviously much higher than that but it's uh
[3534.53s -> 3541.41s]  you son of a bitch but it's still not like that bad i think thresh just intimidates people because
[3542.21s -> 3547.33s]  he can do so much and so i think people just get intimidated but because they they
[3547.33s -> 3554.08s]  they think it looks overwhelming to learn the champ.
[3554.08s -> 3556.14s]  I feel like that actually intimidates a lot of people
[3556.14s -> 3559.14s]  in terms of like people not wanting to
[3559.14s -> 3560.84s]  learn new champions and shits.
[3562.06s -> 3563.80s]  I feel like a lot of it is just,
[3566.24s -> 3568.08s]  people are nervous about learning champions
[3568.08s -> 3572.66s]  that look overwhelming, right?
[3572.66s -> 3574.62s]  Like Iphelios for example, I was talking about this
[3574.62s -> 3577.78s]  yesterday, Iphelios is not a hard mechanical champion.
[3577.78s -> 3582.78s]  Like he's difficult in terms of the knowledge required.
[3582.78s -> 3584.78s]  Like he's knowledge gated very hard
[3585.18s -> 3591.66s]  Right, so like you have to play him a decent amount or like research him to understand what guns do what?
[3591.86s -> 3596.86s]  How to interact with the guns stuff like that, right? But the actual mechanics of using the guns
[3597.58s -> 3599.58s]  It's actually not hard
[3600.18s -> 3615.19s]  Guys, what are we doing? I guess we're just winning the fight
[3618.55s -> 3621.35s]  pike
[3621.35s -> 3623.35s]  Like like I think pike's harder than Thresh
[3626.20s -> 3629.24s]  Maybe that's a hot take, but I think pike is harder than Thresh
[3629.24s -> 3637.36s]  Because Pyke requires like really specific.
[3637.36s -> 3645.08s]  Pyke is a lot harder to play than he looks when you see people play him.
[3645.08s -> 3649.36s]  Because there's like timers of when you can go in off of certain things.
[3649.36s -> 3653.92s]  Like hitting his ulti consistently in teamfights is a little harder than people think.
[3653.92s -> 3658.12s]  And knowing how to position in the lane, like Pyke is capable of a lot more than
[3658.12s -> 3659.12s]  people think.
[3659.12s -> 3663.84s]  So I think pikes I think the reason the main reason I think pikes a little harder is because he's melee
[3668.59s -> 3675.45s]  Like melee champions are always going to be like mechanically more difficult than ranged if the melee champion is like
[3675.99s -> 3680.18s]  You have to engage to go in and do stuff
[3681.30s -> 3683.30s]  Because there's always the counter play factor
[3689.86s -> 3691.54s]  Support role. Yeah, that's what I'm saying
[3691.54s -> 3696.30s]  It's like I'm not saying overall like overall ranged champions require a lot more mechanics than melee
[3696.58s -> 3700.06s]  Just because you're ranged you can die in a global and you have to space and stuff
[3700.06s -> 3704.28s]  But I think that like in just the support you support support specific
[3704.28s -> 3708.86s]  I think melee is a lot harder to play that's why you see a lot of like support players
[3710.08s -> 3714.46s]  We give like the best support boys in the world are really good at like the engage melee supports
[3714.46s -> 3717.60s]  Not the like enchanters and that's why you see like why we praise
[3718.16s -> 3721.46s]  The best support players
[3721.46s -> 3728.46s]  Because like when you see somebody go in like perfectly on recon or go in like find a way in without getting knocked up on like
[3728.46s -> 3731.84s]  I don't know
[3731.84s -> 3736.96s]  something like when they find the angle on thrash and shit it's really nice
[3736.96s -> 3759.18s]  rel I think rel sucks I think that champ is so bad because she just like she
[3759.18s -> 3764.48s]  doesn't do anything like rel's rel's initial thing was like she was supposed
[3764.48s -> 3769.52s]  to go in be really tanky and then be like a stun bot for like team fights
[3769.52s -> 3774.48s]  she was a team fight monster but the problem with rel is like she has one
[3774.48s -> 3779.14s]  One chance essentially in lane phase, if anybody has fingers on their hands and they can move
[3779.14s -> 3783.72s]  left and right, rel is really easy to dodge.
[3783.72s -> 3787.56s]  It's incredibly easy to beat a rel in lane to not die to her.
[3787.56s -> 3789.56s]  You just have to move left and right.
[3789.56s -> 3791.00s]  It's very simple.
[3791.00s -> 3798.60s]  So it's much more difficult to dodge other engaged champs if that makes sense.
[3798.60s -> 3802.84s]  Not unless you can still move left and right, but he can walk at you while it's happening.
[3802.84s -> 3804.80s]  where it's like, if Rell walks at you,
[3804.80s -> 3807.88s]  I'm still like just waiting for the animation
[3807.88s -> 3810.52s]  and then I can simply move to the left
[3810.52s -> 3814.84s]  because like her animation is so slow on using her ability
[3814.84s -> 3817.24s]  that I can like dash, I can flash, I can,
[3817.24s -> 3819.08s]  there's so much counter play.
[3819.08s -> 3820.76s]  And it's like, unless she flashes on you,
[3820.76s -> 3823.00s]  but even then you can tell she's gonna flash on you.
[3823.00s -> 3826.28s]  So it's like, I also feel like mid game,
[3826.28s -> 3830.44s]  Rell has this issue where she has her one trick
[3830.44s -> 3837.81s]  ulti engage fight in teamfights, but after she does that, she does literally nothing.
[3837.81s -> 3841.44s]  She's like a one and done.
[3841.44s -> 3851.12s]  That's why she feels like she doesn't have other expression.
[3851.12s -> 3853.96s]  She's countered so hard by the meta too.
[3853.96s -> 3862.42s]  Milio counters relengage, Thresh counters relengage, either of those champions shits on
[3862.42s -> 3863.92s]  relengage and you can't do anything.
[3863.92s -> 3881.52s]  I don't know if you've ever tried to play rel, gone in and been like Thresh flayed,
[3881.52s -> 3884.44s]  But it's the worst feeling.
[3884.44s -> 3885.44s]  It's a bad feeling.
[3885.44s -> 3892.04s]  It's like when people play Leona, it's the same reason Leona is shit right now.
[3892.04s -> 3896.36s]  Like, they both have the same idea of why they're bad, right?
[3896.36s -> 3899.88s]  They like, have, they're both good at doing what they're supposed to do.
[3899.88s -> 3902.76s]  Like you know, stun and create pressure and point click and shit.
[3902.76s -> 3909.08s]  But the problem is, is like, you can easily counterpick them so incredibly hard that
[3909.08s -> 3910.84s]  they just become worthless the whole game.
[3910.84s -> 3916.73s]  You ever gotten sent a secondary mission? Oh all the time
[3917.37s -> 3921.85s]  With Senna being like with thresh being meta and Senna being like a champion. I'm playing a lot
[3921.85s -> 3923.53s]  I get that all the time
[3923.53s -> 3927.61s]  You don't even notice it though. I'm gonna be real
[3928.85s -> 3934.13s]  When you kill the thresh or whatever and you get these souls you don't even fucking notice it because like it's like 40 armor
[3934.13s -> 3940.77s]  And it's like your level 17 or some shit at that point
[3941.69s -> 3943.25s]  Like at the point you're getting it
[3943.25s -> 3948.77s]  You're such a high level that like the 40 random armor like it's nice, but I never really notice it
[3948.77s -> 3962.66s]  You don't have actually been doing as support on my main account.
[3962.66s -> 3977.93s]  I've actually been roaming non-stop and it's super OP because the key to roaming is all
[3977.93s -> 3984.09s]  you have to do to roam well is literally be there one or two times in the first five
[3984.09s -> 3990.29s]  minutes of the game to completely fuck over the enemy one time on an engage or something
[3990.29s -> 3994.53s]  and they get so far behind from it that you can literally just walk back bot.
[3998.40s -> 4003.28s]  Like I do on Senna. Like I'll push bot lane. This is my strategy on Senna. I'm going to give it to you guys, okay?
[4003.84s -> 4009.12s]  So I don't know if this works in LoL, but in like masters, like high masters, this works at least.
[4010.80s -> 4013.92s]  This is all I do on Senna. Every single player I play against on Senna,
[4014.64s -> 4019.44s]  every single one except for like pike players, even Nautilus, Blitz, they all concede lane level one.
[4020.08s -> 4023.12s]  Every single one of them, right? They just let me push level one.
[4023.52s -> 4031.34s]  And so I'll push the waves in level one and I'll either crash wave two or wave three depending on how far they're giving me like
[4031.64s -> 4037.34s]  Push power, right? So I will always crash wave two or wave three bot and I won't immediately
[4038.94s -> 4040.94s]  roam mid
[4040.94s -> 4042.94s]  every time and
[4044.52s -> 4046.52s]  Even if I don't get a kill
[4047.10s -> 4052.00s]  Usually it fucks over the enemy mid laner so badly because on that exact timer
[4052.00s -> 4057.00s]  there's usually a gank happening on men.
[4057.00s -> 4064.66s]  So a lot of the time people think that you're roaming to get a kill for the laner.
[4064.66s -> 4070.66s]  You're not. You're roaming to counter pressure from the other players in the game.
[4070.66s -> 4076.61s]  How many times have you guys been like, oh, we can win this 2v2?
[4076.61s -> 4079.61s]  You see the enemy jungler? Your jungler comes, you're like, oh, we're going to bait this.
[4079.61s -> 4082.61s]  And then all of a sudden the support shows up and you're like, God damn it.
[4082.61s -> 4084.61s]  And then you die and you're like, what the fuck?
[4084.61s -> 4090.61s]  fuck. That right there is how easy it is to play support. Because all you have to do is show up
[4091.33s -> 4104.32s]  once, twice. And now that entire lane is fucked for the enemy team. Roaming is so easy. The only
[4104.32s -> 4109.76s]  thing, people fuck up roaming really bad when they roam on timers where their AD carry can't
[4109.76s -> 4114.80s]  safely farm. So what ends up happening is on that timer, right, where like I told you wave 2,
[4114.80s -> 4120.12s]  three right what happens is you push that wave in you run mid let's say nothing
[4120.12s -> 4125.80s]  happens okay I can just walk back a bot it's you lose nothing and if usually at
[4125.80s -> 4128.40s]  that point you're not you have like three inner gold so there's no point in
[4128.40s -> 4133.56s]  backing right now let's say like I noticed that my jungler is like invading
[4133.56s -> 4138.80s]  topside I just walk over to top and help him because you have like three to
[4138.80s -> 4145.20s]  for you have like three to four waves before the enemy bot lane the enemy bot lane has
[4145.20s -> 4156.36s]  to play it almost perfectly to be able to abuse your roam on certain timers they essentially
[4156.36s -> 4161.20s]  have to play it perfect to abuse the room what I mean by that is like the way the best way
[4161.20s -> 4167.24s]  to abuse support roaming is you either a if you have the ability to dive you can pretty
[4167.24s -> 4173.68s]  much A, immediately dive, like push the next wave, and then immediately dive if you like
[4173.68s -> 4176.44s]  have that ability, say you're playing Rihanna, Draven or something.
[4176.44s -> 4180.56s]  But even then it's a little risky because then the AD carry can just walk back and they only
[4180.56s -> 4185.28s]  lose one wave and you gave up, you know, a stack chance, so it's not that bad.
[4185.28s -> 4188.56s]  Two, you can stack the wave.
[4188.56s -> 4193.24s]  Now stacking the wave is the best way to counter it, because let's say I'm roaming
[4193.24s -> 4196.64s]  for an extended period, you stack like a three wave, and then all of a sudden
[4196.64s -> 4200.02s]  you're crashing it and then you want to like you're up a level because you've been gaining
[4200.02s -> 4205.12s]  XP and the AD carry has to back off, but the way to counter that is you simply just walk
[4205.12s -> 4209.88s]  back on the timer of the stacked wave crashing as an AD carry or as a support.
[4209.88s -> 4211.88s]  It's so incredibly easy to do.
[4211.88s -> 4214.64s]  It's actually brainlessly easy to do.
[4214.64s -> 4220.68s]  Like it's literally you can roam all you want bot lane as long as you are in bot
[4220.68s -> 4224.92s]  lane for the stacked wave crashes or you are in bot lane when your jungler is
[4224.92s -> 4237.33s]  bot side of the map. It's easy as fuck. But support players drool in themselves. So they
[4237.33s -> 4244.13s]  like to essentially... Support players like to AFK in the lane phase. They like to literally
[4244.13s -> 4251.25s]  sit there and just do nothing. That's like the average support I see is they will stand
[4251.25s -> 4257.68s]  and do nothing. And I've said this before but I'll say it again. Being a good support
[4257.68s -> 4261.16s]  is not being a better player than the enemy team. Being a good support is queuing up
[4261.16s -> 4263.16s]  to play League of Legends.
[4263.16s -> 4265.70s]  That's all it takes.
[4265.70s -> 4270.72s]  All it takes to be a good support is queuing up with the intent to push buttons in the game.
[4270.72s -> 4271.72s]  And not just AFK.
[4271.72s -> 4501.24s]  Alright, I'm back.
[4501.24s -> 4502.24s]  What's up?
[4502.24s -> 4505.04s]  I don't remember what we were talking about.
[4505.04s -> 4506.04s]  Oh, supports.
[4506.04s -> 4507.04s]  Yeah, they're all stupid.
[4507.04s -> 4512.63s]  Don't AFK on support?
[4512.63s -> 4513.63s]  You'll gain LP.
[4513.63s -> 4515.63s]  It's actually that easy.
[4515.63s -> 4529.91s]  Honestly, I don't think supports are stupid.
[4529.91s -> 4533.23s]  I think it's more of a, how do I phrase this?
[4533.23s -> 4535.23s]  In my opinion it's more of like a
[4537.48s -> 4546.83s]  They're like they've never they don't have to learn support players like don't have to learn
[4548.15s -> 4553.07s]  Important things because they can get away with not doing it. So they get they develop bad habits. That's all it is
[4553.63s -> 4564.43s]  Do you have a Spotify playlist?
[4564.47s -> 4570.72s]  Yeah, best role to climb I
[4571.76s -> 4574.40s]  Think every role is good to climb as long as you're good
[4575.12s -> 4577.12s]  Classic Jara. Oh, I don't see
[4577.40s -> 4581.36s]  Whatever you linked like I don't know how links in the chat because I had to turn them off a long time ago
[4582.36s -> 4590.34s]  So I can't see it.
[4590.34s -> 4594.46s]  I would say that climbing is just about like whatever, cause every role you can climb on,
[4594.46s -> 4596.14s]  right, like every single role.
[4596.14s -> 4606.12s]  So climbing a lot of the time is just about what you think is most fun for you and you
[4606.12s -> 4607.72s]  can get the best of it.
[4607.72s -> 4614.32s]  I would say objectively the best roles to climb on are jungle and support for just
[4614.32s -> 4617.48s]  like higher elo.
[4617.48s -> 4621.44s]  Well jungle and lower elo support and higher elo.
[4621.44s -> 4626.36s]  I wouldn't climb on support in like gold because you're not going to have a good time trying
[4626.36s -> 4630.04s]  to like help bad players play the game.
[4630.04s -> 4631.04s]  Bad.
[4631.04s -> 4632.04s]  That's mean.
[4632.04s -> 4635.68s]  I people who don't like you can get it like a gold Ezreal 30 kills by being the better
[4635.68s -> 4638.44s]  support but you won't always win.
[4638.44s -> 4642.52s]  Whereas like if you really want to control solo queue and your teammates aren't like
[4642.52s -> 4647.72s]  good enough to carry at that level by themselves right like you get frustrated just pick
[4647.72s -> 4661.16s]  something that has more agency in the game. You lost 18 of 24 as jungle, you want to try
[4661.16s -> 4667.80s]  any role. I mean you could play AD, if you think it's, AD carry is interesting. I wouldn't
[4667.80s -> 4680.92s]  say it's like fun, but it's not, it's not bad. You're in gold. I mean you could try
[4680.92s -> 4685.56s]  it. My view on it is if people were wondering if they want to play a role or not, my view
[4685.56s -> 4688.48s]  is just try it, see if you like it, because if you don't like the role you're not
[4688.48s -> 4693.36s]  to be able to put in enough games to get good at the role right so like just give it a try see
[4693.36s -> 4698.16s]  if you enjoy it or not and if like it's not fun then if it's not your playstyle it's not fun
[4698.16s -> 4706.24s]  because 80s are a unique playstyle from all the other roles like the reason people don't like
[4706.24s -> 4712.32s]  playing ad carry and like like watching ad carry streamers and shit is because it ad carry is
[4712.32s -> 4716.28s]  is like, it's boring.
[4716.28s -> 4721.35s]  ADC is like, zero, like if there was a graph of shit
[4721.35s -> 4723.31s]  going on when you're playing ADC in the game,
[4723.31s -> 4725.99s]  it's like this, that is like spikes to 100,
[4725.99s -> 4728.43s]  and then it's back to like this, right?
[4728.43s -> 4735.44s]  It's like, ADC is a lot of, every game is different,
[4736.36s -> 4737.20s]  right?
[4737.20s -> 4740.04s]  Every game when you play ADC is different,
[4740.04s -> 4743.84s]  because you're always with a different player,
[4743.84s -> 4745.68s]  like a different support unless you do OQ.
[4745.68s -> 4748.84s]  So, every AD carry game's difference, coupled with,
[4750.44s -> 4752.52s]  you spend a lot of the game just farming.
[4752.52s -> 4755.06s]  Like, you don't get to interact with the enemy a lot.
[4755.06s -> 4757.04s]  So you just kind of farm a lot of the game.
[4757.04s -> 4759.16s]  And even then, you also like,
[4760.52s -> 4762.60s]  you basically are farming for like little dopamine hits
[4762.60s -> 4764.64s]  of like team fights and stuff that you get around the game.
[4764.64s -> 4768.78s]  So that's kind of fun.
[4768.78s -> 4770.24s]  But it's, like I said, it's all you.
[4770.24s -> 4771.92s]  You can climb on any role.
[4771.92s -> 4774.52s]  I think AD carry requires the most mechanical skill
[4774.52s -> 4778.00s]  to climb because the difference between,
[4778.40s -> 4781.10s]  Climbing is like a jungler is about being in the right spot at the right time, right?
[4781.10s -> 4783.82s]  Like you need to path this way get objectives, etc
[4783.94s -> 4789.66s]  Climbing is an ad carry is more about like this person fucked up their positioning. I'm gonna kill them type shit
[4812.40s -> 4818.30s]  Constar to Q
[4818.30s -> 4820.30s]  Also, I want to I want to say something
[4820.74s -> 4823.38s]  if you are playing
[4824.16s -> 4828.42s]  Make sure and this is just a really good standardized bit of advice
[4828.90s -> 4833.26s]  Make sure you're always tracking what the enemy cooldowns are what their spells are stuff like that's
[4833.26s -> 4842.26s]  That's okay because playing the game is not just about like farming and you know like your team goes in and you auto and shit
[4842.38s -> 4846.26s]  Like right now mid's Mia, right? I can see that Varus is Mia, but it is a Varus
[4846.26s -> 4849.34s]  So like I'm not too worried about being like a little toed by a Varus
[4850.06s -> 4853.86s]  Not that much right so I can kind of play backward because I know that
[4854.94s -> 4859.10s]  It's a high chance. He's not gonna run bottom level 2 is a Varus now that was like a fizz or some shit
[4859.10s -> 4860.54s]  I immediately back up
[4860.54s -> 4864.54s]  So we noticed that it's pretty obvious Rakan probably got w level 2
[4864.54s -> 4868.62s]  We don't know what it is, but he has Q so he doesn't have shield which means
[4871.97s -> 4876.11s]  Because he doesn't have shield
[4876.15s -> 4879.55s]  It's hard for the Recon to get back out if he fucks up and engage
[4880.43s -> 4883.03s]  So you need to think about these type of things right now
[4883.03s -> 4885.73s]  This is wave 4 I believe and because it's wave 4
[4886.23s -> 4891.35s]  We're gonna get level 3 on wave 4 you always get level 3 on wave 4 if you have full XP
[4893.87s -> 4895.87s]  you get level 2 on wave 2 and
[4896.91s -> 4898.91s]  you get level 3 on wave 4 and
[4898.91s -> 4905.79s]  And these timers for when you get certain level ups, bot lane, are very important.
[4905.79s -> 4912.24s]  Now I'm going to hover over here, you see how Fiddle is right here.
[4912.24s -> 4919.80s]  I'm actually going to just walk in here and see if I can like, yeah we see him, nice.
[4919.80s -> 4922.76s]  See this isn't exactly what I was talking about before.
[4922.76s -> 4925.20s]  Do you see what my support is doing?
[4925.20s -> 4927.96s]  I left the lane.
[4927.96s -> 4934.58s]  Guys I walked to like stand next to my jungler after we pushed the wave in my Lulu is
[4935.70s -> 4937.86s]  Hanging out by herself
[4938.50s -> 4939.50s]  bot lane
[4939.50s -> 4959.47s]  But she's just chilling you don't want to do that
[4960.43s -> 4965.45s]  You don't ever want to be the guy who's like by yourself bot lane as a support
[4966.67s -> 4967.95s]  because
[4967.95s -> 4971.15s]  You don't know like supports don't need gold right not really and
[4971.15s -> 4973.81s]  And you don't need farm. You don't need all that shit
[4973.81s -> 4977.69s]  So if you're ad carry roams and unless the wave is fucked and they're just being stupid
[4977.69s -> 4980.71s]  You have to fix the wave or something. You don't want to be by yourself in the lane
[4981.27s -> 4988.17s]  It just doesn't do anything. How about an auto tower? Oh, I used
[4989.25s -> 4994.91s]  Tilda so there's a way there's actually a setting you can have in the game where when you hit a button
[4995.35s -> 5000.55s]  It makes it so that I can't physically hit anything, but a champion. It's target
[5000.55s -> 5005.31s]  It's called target champions only and it's basically like here. I'll do it for you right now watch
[5005.31s -> 5007.95s]  You see how like I can hit the tower you see how it's the red
[5008.79s -> 5009.85s]  sword
[5009.85s -> 5011.15s]  look
[5011.15s -> 5014.77s]  So when I hit this button, I can no longer hit the tower or the minions
[5015.91s -> 5017.91s]  But I can still hit the champions
[5019.63s -> 5025.47s]  So essentially when you're fighting in a big minion wave or you're fighting under turret you don't want to miss click
[5026.87s -> 5029.23s]  you just hit target champions only button and
[5029.23s -> 5033.79s]  And it makes it a thousand times easier because you can literally only hit the champion
[5034.19s -> 5037.74s]  It's really nice
[5037.74s -> 5051.51s]  And you can make the button anything you want obviously I just I use tilde. It's the default I
[5057.48s -> 5061.52s]  Actually want to kill these guys, but I need the way for the way to push out just the hair
[5062.60s -> 5066.68s]  The jungler could be bought but it is a fiddlesticks. So it's like I don't really care about a fiddlesticks being bought
[5067.04s -> 5082.99s]  We can straight up just kill them. Okay. Well apparently we can't kill them
[5086.88s -> 5089.92s]  Because apparently my Lulu didn't want to walk up
[5090.88s -> 5099.68s]  That's so frustrating man. I did fuck up my my auto there, but I am a little I am kind of curious what happens
[5099.68s -> 5102.64s]  I don't have to go watch the VOD. I fucked up my kill in the Zaya
[5102.64s -> 5109.52s]  I think I walked left instead or down my movement was bad like essentially when they fought right I walked like this
[5109.52s -> 5111.52s]  I should have walked like this
[5111.76s -> 5117.84s]  Because you want to cut off the Zaya from the gank now. I do think when Lulu just blindly ran away
[5117.84s -> 5123.08s]  I think she kind of grieved you don't need to insta run from ganks, especially when like you could see what I have right?
[5123.08s -> 5125.08s]  I have Dirk and Sheen
[5125.52s -> 5131.20s]  Something that a lot of people do as well is they will see that like the numbers are uneven and they'll instantly run away
[5131.20s -> 5135.02s]  They don't think about like how to win the fight or like what the the win con is of the fight
[5135.36s -> 5139.76s]  Because that's what I was saying before we got ganked right I was like fiddle can't gank us and he can't pre-6
[5139.76s -> 5141.96s]  Fiddle does nothing in the gank. I had cleanse
[5141.96s -> 5148.72s]  They don't actually beat us in 3v2. So the problem was is we weren't focusing the same target
[5148.72s -> 5151.20s]  I went for the Zyre and she backed really far up
[5151.64s -> 5156.30s]  Now if we had played forward a bit like say she played a little more forward with me
[5156.32s -> 5158.98s]  That would have gone a lot better or if I had played a little more back with her
[5159.16s -> 5166.38s]  It was basically like we don't have comms. So the you know, it got rough now fiddle is six now
[5166.78s -> 5168.78s]  So it's a little scary. I
[5169.50s -> 5173.46s]  Don't like playing versus fiddle sticks for like the reason of like 90% of the time
[5173.66s -> 5178.18s]  players don't know how to ward around fiddle, people put wards in weird spots
[5178.18s -> 5192.84s]  we should have won that fight though I'm a little salty mainly myself so this
[5192.84s -> 5199.84s]  too Lulu keeps speeding me up I want to be honest with you I don't like when
[5199.84s -> 5206.21s]  Lulu's do that it's like a pet peeve thing of mine when Lulu's use their speed
[5206.21s -> 5210.25s]  like I'm okay with it if I need to dodge something or I need to chase
[5210.25s -> 5214.33s]  somebody but I think it's just so much less value than using it to CC early
[5214.33s -> 5220.85s]  early game the CC of Lulu like using W is so broken to me because they just
[5220.85s -> 5225.61s]  physically can't move their character for like 1.5 seconds which is crazy I
[5225.61s -> 5239.98s]  think fiddles bot you can kind of tell you see how they're playing really
[5239.98s -> 5245.46s]  aggressive they don't beat us 2v2 so I'm thinking and they just cleared this
[5245.46s -> 5250.70s]  ward out I'm thinking fiddles is either on dragon or he's bush ganking bot
[5250.70s -> 5259.90s]  Somewhere so I don't really want to walk up you see how this guy is confidently hitting the turret
[5260.02s -> 5270.88s]  This is making me think fiddles trying to lane gank because they cannot beat us to be to like I think fiddles in here
[5271.28s -> 5275.10s]  So I'm actually just gonna play safe
[5276.38s -> 5278.38s]  Until we see him on the map, I don't know
[5279.42s -> 5290.51s]  I'm not gonna take the chance because
[5291.95s -> 5294.67s]  You got to think about like what you see and what you don't see on the map
[5294.79s -> 5298.83s]  Like we can't physically see fiddler, right? But think about this. We don't see him top
[5298.83s -> 5304.41s]  That's something you have to think about we we had a ward on riff just now for 15 15 seconds, right?
[5305.31s -> 5307.31s]  We didn't see him top
[5307.63s -> 5314.38s]  So like if he's not top, where is he now? I think he finally left
[5315.14s -> 5331.38s]  This looks like he went to dragon. Yeah, what are we doing by the way? I?
[5332.58s -> 5334.46s]  Mean I guess I'm just gonna die
[5334.46s -> 5337.96s]  Now would be the time to speed me. I
[5338.64s -> 5342.74s]  Mean, I don't even know what to say about that Malzahar just didn't walk
[5342.74s -> 5354.66s]  Gragas didn't flash his E. Malzahar didn't walk. You always walk there by the way. I want to make this clear.
[5354.66s -> 5361.66s]  If you're a mid laner and you're playing a late game scaling mid, you always walk to the fight no matter what though.
[5361.66s -> 5364.66s]  If it's at, if it's going, if it's doing that.
[5365.42s -> 5367.42s]  Okay guys
[5367.90s -> 5375.26s]  We need to walk to fights and Lulu you need to follow up when I go in don't run
[5375.70s -> 5380.18s]  I'm just gonna type it because I'm actually fucking annoyed
[5382.17s -> 5386.93s]  My little frustrated. I still think the game is a hundred percent winnable, but I'm playing Draven
[5386.93s -> 5389.81s]  We're playing like I'm playing fucking Ezreal or some shit
[5390.53s -> 5395.49s]  And I can't walk up because essentially we know fiddle was bought for the last two three minutes, right?
[5395.49s -> 5407.43s]  He just sat down there. What is my Lulu doing bro? What are you doing?
[5410.66s -> 5412.66s]  No, we fight this go
[5413.30s -> 5422.15s]  Yeah, this guy doesn't get to do this for free now. They have a gale force. So I need to be a little care
[5423.15s -> 5425.15s]  This guy has no ulti though
[5427.74s -> 5430.98s]  Like this is what I'm losing my mind man. I
[5431.82s -> 5433.58s]  do just
[5433.58s -> 5438.60s]  follow
[5438.60s -> 5442.24s]  No, what she was doing what she was trying to protect her ward
[5442.24s -> 5449.44s]  She saw the Recon hitting the Ward, but the Ziya walked up to get a Freed to just die.
[5449.44s -> 5458.80s]  The problem is, my Lulu was like, oh I don't want to give up my Ward, and she wasn't thinking.
[5458.80s -> 5462.40s]  Please just sit with me, okay?
[5462.40s -> 5465.36s]  Yep, sorry.
[5465.36s -> 5467.96s]  I need you to follow me.
[5467.96s -> 5470.16s]  Always.
[5470.16s -> 5474.68s]  Even if it looks scary, you gotta follow.
[5474.68s -> 5484.03s]  Okay?
[5484.03s -> 5489.99s]  So one thing is there's actually not a lot of fighting that happens in lower elo.
[5489.99s -> 5493.59s]  So a lot of these players don't know how to fight early.
[5493.59s -> 5497.75s]  Because one thing that I think has gotten really bad about league lately, just in the
[5497.75s -> 5503.07s]  past few years, is people don't ever, limit test and league ever anymore.
[5503.07s -> 5505.91s]  They always just play like pussies.
[5505.91s -> 5510.03s]  Every single player in league plays like a fucking pussie nowadays and it's literally
[5510.03s -> 5519.14s]  just like sad to see.
[5519.14s -> 5522.48s]  Like right there, why aren't we W-ing?
[5522.48s -> 5526.82s]  Use W on the Ziya.
[5526.82s -> 5530.79s]  Not too speed.
[5530.79s -> 5535.91s]  Like I'm losing my mind because all you have to do there is W the Ziya, she gets CC'd,
[5535.91s -> 5538.31s]  we kill her in the W.
[5538.31s -> 5545.39s]  I'm telling you, Lulu players are like hardwired for some reason to not play correctly.
[5545.39s -> 5565.08s]  I'm never going to catch this guy, he's got gale force and tier 2 boots.
[5565.08s -> 5574.23s]  Yeah, I mean I have to go for it though because if I don't go for kills now the game's over
[5574.55s -> 5578.41s]  So it's either we go for it or we lose so I'm willing to like look stupid
[5581.94s -> 5585.86s]  Honestly, this game was my fault for the one 2v3 that happened early
[5585.86s -> 5589.30s]  I misplayed it and if I didn't misplay that we would have won the game off it
[5590.18s -> 5592.18s]  Now the game is pretty much over
[5592.98s -> 5597.98s]  Like it's all okay, so we can always come back, but the problem is I don't think
[5598.22s -> 5602.02s]  We have good enough players to come back like look at what Lulu is doing Lulu
[5603.02s -> 5609.57s]  Why are you bought solo at the moment think like what?
[5612.05s -> 5614.05s]  What are we doing?
[5614.33s -> 5624.68s]  This is exactly what I was telling you guys doesn't make sense
[5625.28s -> 5633.38s]  Remember when I told you supports easy all you have to do is be a human remember when I said that 40 sec or four minutes ago before the game started
[5633.80s -> 5639.88s]  All you have to do to play support is think push buttons and be active in the game
[5639.88s -> 5647.95s]  And if you can do those things you'll get challenger on support like it blows my mind
[5648.59s -> 5650.87s]  Like what look what you did? What are you doing?
[5651.71s -> 5673.85s]  This is a forfeit though. I'm gonna lose my minds
[5676.63s -> 5678.63s]  Auto-filled ad
[5682.61s -> 5683.97s]  I'm gonna lose it
[5683.97s -> 5695.70s]  My bad guess. I'm an auto-filled ad. I'm just bad. It's on me. I apologize. Oh
[5704.44s -> 5706.44s]  Man, these players are crazy
[5706.48s -> 5712.05s]  I'm actually really surprised. We're just not forfeiting now
[5712.05s -> 5720.26s]  The best way to play the game is something that like I fall victim to to where I fuck this up sometimes right?
[5720.64s -> 5722.64s]  But the best way to play the game a lot of the time is
[5723.32s -> 5726.24s]  You essentially don't play to take risks. I
[5727.92s -> 5732.24s]  Know it sounds silly because you got to find essentially you have to find the
[5733.12s -> 5743.38s]  My mouths are hard. Just let let this guy this one thousand gold walk away. Hey mouse
[5744.34s -> 5747.84s]  If you moved by the way, you get one K gold
[5756.10s -> 5759.38s]  Mid isn't hard roll.
[5759.38s -> 5765.36s]  I can mid in my sleep.
[5765.36s -> 5766.20s]  It's not.
[5767.16s -> 5775.88s]  AD is easiest roll.
[5775.88s -> 5778.36s]  I'm AD carry streamer.
[5778.36s -> 5789.42s]  I play AD, but Lulu is small brain.
[5789.42s -> 5790.46s]  That was mean.
[5790.46s -> 5792.58s]  Lulu took some crossfire there
[5792.58s -> 5793.50s]  that she didn't need to take.
[5793.50s -> 5796.60s]  That was my bad.
[5796.60s -> 5815.64s]  That was toxic.
[5815.64s -> 5816.48s]  I'll be real.
[5816.48s -> 5819.20s]  I think today's gonna be a mute all kind of day.
[5819.20s -> 5822.72s]  Listening to low elo players talk about the game
[5822.72s -> 5825.80s]  And then they think that they're right about the game and like how it works and all this shit.
[5826.16s -> 5829.84s]  It actually like hurts me, like it shouldn't. I should just laugh it off.
[5829.84s -> 5834.12s]  But sometimes when I see a low elo player talk about how they think the game should be played.
[5834.48s -> 5835.76s]  And I just know that they're wrong.
[5836.40s -> 5838.16s]  It actually like physically hurts me.
[5841.91s -> 5843.63s]  It does. It physically hurts.
[5853.56s -> 5860.12s]  But I should follow my own rule where if you're playing with people that aren't as good, like they don't see what you see.
[5860.96s -> 5864.52s]  Right. There's like something where it's better to play safe and scale.
[5864.88s -> 5869.28s]  even on Draven. It's better to play safe in scale than to go for plays in lane.
[5872.96s -> 5881.20s]  Mainly because if you go for plays in lane and let's say your support is not as good as you,
[5881.20s -> 5885.84s]  or your support's not confident in their ability to 2v2, right, then you're just going to lose.
[5885.84s -> 5889.04s]  So you're like forcing that person to be in an uncomfortable situation.
[5889.04s -> 5897.04s]  So, like, it's hard for me as a player to just play safe when I see the enemy making mistake after mistake.
[5897.04s -> 5901.04s]  It's like something that I have trouble, like, personally working on, right?
[5901.04s -> 5906.04s]  It's just like a personal issue where, like, I'll see an enemy make a mistake positional-wise and I'm like,
[5906.04s -> 5907.04s]  oh, shit, let's abuse this.
[5907.04s -> 5913.04s]  But a lot of the time the problem that happens is you have somebody who doesn't know that that person made a mistake
[5913.04s -> 5915.04s]  or doesn't see the same mistake as me.
[5915.04s -> 5918.04s]  And because there's no comms, I can't relate to them that we should fight, right?
[5918.04s -> 5921.02s]  Right, so if I go in and they don't know that we should be fighting there
[5921.02s -> 5928.48s]  I I end up dying and it looks it feels really bad, which is I mean
[5929.50s -> 5934.34s]  My fault. It's like a personal thing because you can't control your supports. You can only control yourself
[5934.98s -> 5937.54s]  It's just something that like I suck at doing sometimes
[5939.26s -> 5968.22s]  Right so that's just on man. We could actually kill the Zyra now by the way. She's like 60% HP
[5968.22s -> 6006.44s]  like we could kill her what is my Gragas doing oh he got her though nice bro use
[6006.44s -> 6020.80s]  W to CC people not just speed people that was a good example too oh well I
[6020.80s -> 6029.94s]  just got to get better at doing that where I play safe though that's on me
[6029.94s -> 6060.98s]  that's just a personal thing I got to get better at oh man I think we're
[6060.98s -> 6065.26s]  warmed up though what 80 carry do you guys want to see next game that was
[6065.26s -> 6069.66s]  That was a brutal ass game. I'm gonna be real. That was a brutal ass game
[6071.06s -> 6074.44s]  What ad carry streamer do you guys want to see or ad carry stream what ad carry?
[6076.62s -> 6086.08s]  Champion do you guys want to see this game? I just goofed up and tried to play too aggressive with a player that wasn't willing to
[6086.08s -> 6088.08s]  Play aggressive that was on me
[6088.68s -> 6111.09s]  That's my bed. I'll I'll play better this guy this guy goes scion
[6119.64s -> 6121.94s]  Never change, Twitch chat, never change.
[6141.07s -> 6143.47s]  Well, the thing is, I have to change my mindset.
[6143.47s -> 6145.71s]  So like the thing, okay, let me explain something
[6145.71s -> 6147.63s]  just like a personal thing with me.
[6147.63s -> 6150.31s]  I'm very, very, very good mechanically at this game, right?
[6150.31s -> 6153.43s]  Like it's my best trade, it's like I have very good mechanics.
[6153.43s -> 6156.99s]  So, and I also have like an autistic weird brain
[6156.99s -> 6161.99s]  where I can see, I have really good pattern recognition.
[6162.27s -> 6165.11s]  So when I see that the enemy is fucking up,
[6165.11s -> 6170.83s]  I know that I'm pretty much always going to be better at the 2v2, okay?
[6170.83s -> 6177.91s]  So because I know that I'm always going to be better at the 2v2, I always want to take
[6177.91s -> 6183.95s]  the fight when I see that they make a mistake, like they miss a skill shot or they walk up
[6183.95s -> 6186.35s]  too far, stuff like that, right?
[6186.35s -> 6190.51s]  But the problem is, when you're bought in, you have to work with a teammate.
[6190.51s -> 6192.39s]  And that's part of just playing AD carry, right?
[6192.39s -> 6194.63s]  And if you're in solo queue, you can't always do it.
[6194.63s -> 6202.63s]  So you have to, I have to like train myself to just be okay with them making mistakes and
[6202.63s -> 6205.39s]  us not abusing those mistakes.
[6205.39s -> 6208.51s]  It's very frustrating for me personally because I'm a perfectionist.
[6208.51s -> 6211.11s]  So it's very frustrating for me to like see this happening and I'm like oh I want to
[6211.11s -> 6212.99s]  abuse this because I know we can.
[6212.99s -> 6217.27s]  But we have to like, I have to like tell myself not to and to just like not fuck
[6217.27s -> 6219.91s]  up the wave state, not take bad trades and shit.
[6219.91s -> 6222.27s]  Because every time, there's more to it too.
[6222.27s -> 6224.07s]  So if like I walk up and I take a fight, right?
[6224.07s -> 6231.03s]  like when Rakan w'd in when the fiddle ganked for example right uh if i take that fight i'm now
[6231.03s -> 6236.15s]  banking that fight on lulu also playing correctly right like they they missed all their abilities
[6236.15s -> 6244.55s]  and they fucked up but i also messed like you nobody can play perfectly every game like i can't
[6244.55s -> 6248.47s]  teammates can't nobody can't it's league and we're all humans right so you have to bank
[6248.47s -> 6252.23s]  when you're doing that on like your teammate being able to know what you want to accomplish
[6252.23s -> 6257.83s]  in that moment in solo queue with no comms and it's really hard like it's a really bad mindset
[6257.83s -> 6265.59s]  that I have sometimes but it's hard to get over because like I like the landing phase for me is
[6265.59s -> 6272.25s]  the most fun part of the game. I love landing phase because in my opinion landing phase is like a
[6272.25s -> 6277.29s]  little mini chess game between the enemy bot lane right it's like a it's like a chess game with
[6277.29s -> 6284.09s]  like mechanics where it's like how well can like I auto space them right? Can I space them well?
[6284.73s -> 6290.01s]  Can I space them like can I by spacing I mean can I walk into them trade and not take damage back
[6290.01s -> 6294.17s]  right? And I'm always thinking to myself like okay can I do that? I can and then I'm like I want
[6294.17s -> 6298.33s]  to do this right? And then I'll like get somebody to half and then they'll panic and they'll
[6298.33s -> 6303.93s]  engage on me and the problem is though is like I said without comms or without like people
[6303.93s -> 6307.77s]  who are recognizing what you're trying to accomplish.
[6307.77s -> 6313.55s]  Sometimes supports and junglers, people get flustered and it will go badly.
[6313.55s -> 6317.39s]  And it's my fault at the end of the day because I'm choosing to that playstyle of relying
[6317.39s -> 6322.27s]  on my teammates instead of knowing that I can probably outscale and play better late
[6322.27s -> 6326.37s]  game and just keep good CS and not die and shit, which is what you guys should
[6326.37s -> 6328.15s]  all do.
[6328.15s -> 6330.93s]  And that's what I tell people to do when they ask me how to play AD.
[6330.93s -> 6333.57s]  I tell you like don't die scale up get items
[6334.07s -> 6338.03s]  But like because I've played the game for so long and my favorite part of the game is
[6339.97s -> 6342.93s]  Lane phase and like winning lane and playing that little chess game
[6342.93s -> 6344.93s]  I fucked myself over in a lot of games
[6345.65s -> 6351.77s]  Because I'll like, you know force fights that like my teammate would have to play well in as well to win and
[6352.49s -> 6357.97s]  I'll make a mistake or they'll make a mistake and we'll just lose the game off it and it's not a good play style
[6357.97s -> 6365.89s]  right? It's not a good poi style. That's just like something that like I know other people probably
[6365.89s -> 6370.29s]  also have and I'm telling you that like if you want to climb you got to get out of that mindset
[6370.29s -> 6379.31s]  and get into the mindset of like consistency because you can see last game for example I just
[6379.31s -> 6386.35s]  straight up like lost the game off of me trying to fight when my support didn't know how to
[6386.35s -> 6394.37s]  fight or want to fight and we lost the game off it. Like I was too aggro and even though if they
[6394.37s -> 6399.89s]  did play correctly we win they didn't so we lost. So it's basically like it's just not like a good uh
[6401.01s -> 6413.94s]  it's not a good uh what's the word I'm looking for strategy because last game was my fault
[6414.90s -> 6419.54s]  because I'm good enough at the game that I know that I can't play like that if I want to be
[6419.54s -> 6430.90s]  Consistent and I still point like it. So it's my bad. All right, what are we playing this game boys? We got Rengar karma Jin
[6431.90s -> 6435.58s]  What do people want to see? Let me see if any of the 80 carries people want to see if I could play these I
[6437.14s -> 6441.78s]  Can't play vain into this the vein would be way too hard in the karma Jin. I would just get zoned off the wave
[6441.78s -> 6451.88s]  I could play a fellios
[6453.04s -> 6462.90s]  This is actually a good a fellios game. You know what kind of sucks I feel kind of bad playing a fellios
[6462.90s -> 6468.88s]  when I'm on my like teaching account, like this account I teach you guys, I feel bad
[6468.88s -> 6474.86s]  playing Aphelios sometimes because I know a lot of people don't want to learn
[6474.86s -> 6483.82s]  Aphelios or play Aphelios because he is like really, he's very unique, like he's
[6483.82s -> 6487.74s]  he's hard to learn for a lot of people, so I feel I always feel kind of bad
[6487.74s -> 6494.82s]  doing it right but I'll be real I don't know in this specific situation outside
[6494.82s -> 6501.90s]  of like Jinx I didn't really know what else to pick like Jinx is good Kaisa is
[6501.90s -> 6512.64s]  probably okay but you still get zoned off the wave on Kaisa because like if we
[6512.64s -> 6521.27s]  if we look at this right Kaisa would have been I guess okay but when you're
[6521.27s -> 6525.23s]  picking a champion for bot lane right when you're picking a champion for
[6525.23s -> 6530.11s]  bot lane, one thing that you guys should think about when picking like what you know what champion you want to play
[6530.11s -> 6531.91s]  Unless you're a one trick and then play whatever you want
[6531.91s -> 6537.61s]  But if you're like somebody who wants to actually like play the meta and learn why champions are meta and when to pick what?
[6540.72s -> 6542.72s]  They picked gin karma now
[6543.60s -> 6549.72s]  We have a Lulu if we had something with a hook like a Nautilus a blitz a thresh a pike
[6550.04s -> 6553.92s]  Like if we had something like that I could pick a low-range fighter, right?
[6554.32s -> 6556.56s]  Like I could pick a low-range fighter if we had a hook champ
[6556.56s -> 6567.56s]  But because we don't have a hook champ and we have an enchanter, I have to pick something that can safely, consistently farm and not get zoned off by their bot lane.
[6567.56s -> 6577.56s]  So there's not a lot of options that can do that. You could pick Ezreal here, it's not the worst, but we had a Lulu so I didn't want to pick Ezreal because Lulu goes to waste.
[6577.56s -> 6582.56s]  So it's like you could pick Jinx, but I kind of didn't want to pick Jinx this game because Jinx bore the shit out of me right now.
[6582.56s -> 6587.62s]  So this would be a good jinx game though if you guys are curious like this would
[6587.62s -> 6594.44s]  be a completely fine jinx game. Your E stops Rengar jump. You can follow up
[6594.44s -> 6601.16s]  really easily with Lulu. Like this would be a good jinx game. But it's a
[6601.16s -> 6605.36s]  good a felios game too. It's both. It's good a felios game, good jinx game. It
[6605.36s -> 6609.68s]  could be a good Zerri game. Zerri wouldn't be that bad here with Lulu
[6609.68s -> 6615.58s]  And against their comp they're all really squishy. She's really mobile can get away from like ring our ganks pretty easily
[6616.58s -> 6619.62s]  Tristana, I okay, so Trist is unique because
[6620.86s -> 6624.80s]  You only pick Tristana if you plan on winning lane, okay?
[6625.92s -> 6630.14s]  Tristana doesn't actually scale better than Jinx in any way
[6631.72s -> 6633.88s]  Like she does not have a better scaling than Jinx
[6633.88s -> 6641.80s]  Trist, Trist vs Jynx 3 items, Jynx wins every time in teamfights no matter what, she just
[6641.80s -> 6645.28s]  does what Trist does better.
[6645.28s -> 6649.00s]  Now the reason you pick Trist is because you do want to win lane, you want to jump in,
[6649.00s -> 6651.00s]  you want to kill them, you want to be aggressive, right?
[6651.00s -> 6654.24s]  So that's what you're picking Trist for, it's going to get kills in lane.
[6654.24s -> 6656.92s]  The problem is, is again what we were just talking about, right?
[6656.92s -> 6659.16s]  Let's say I pick Trist to get kills in lane.
[6659.16s -> 6664.58s]  Now let's say my support doesn't want to be aggressive, and let's say like the Jhin and
[6664.58s -> 6667.90s]  the Karma have a really good push, okay?
[6667.90s -> 6671.66s]  Something that Trist is really weak at is being pushed in, right?
[6671.66s -> 6675.34s]  That's one of her weakest things, because she struggles, especially early game, she
[6675.34s -> 6678.34s]  struggles quite a bit on farming under turret.
[6678.34s -> 6682.80s]  So let's say, it's just like a coin-flippy pick.
[6682.80s -> 6688.54s]  You could pick Trist if you had like a support duo, for sure, into Jhin.
[6688.54s -> 6693.42s]  is amazing into Jhin. It's one of Jhin's hardest actual counters, but again, it's not
[6693.42s -> 6696.72s]  about countering the champion, it's about countering the lane and what the lane is going
[6696.72s -> 6701.82s]  to do to you and being able to play around that. And this lane is a shove lane. Jhin
[6701.82s -> 6705.66s]  Karma doesn't fight you. They poke you and shove waves in. That's what they do. They're
[6705.66s -> 6709.90s]  a prior win. So they're just going to shove and shove and shove, right? So because
[6709.90s -> 6712.26s]  they're just going to shove and shove and shove, I need to play something that
[6712.26s -> 6715.58s]  isn't going to have issues playing under turret or something that can shove back if
[6715.58s -> 6725.12s]  I need to. Right, which is why Jinx and Aphelios are both good. Ezreal again would just get
[6725.12s -> 6728.36s]  shoved in. Stuff like that. These are things you actually have to think about when you're
[6728.36s -> 6735.88s]  playing the game for certain champions and certain matchups. Because a lot of the time,
[6735.88s -> 6739.32s]  people will pick a champion that's meta and they won't understand why they're still
[6739.32s -> 6742.92s]  losing the matchup even though they're good at that champion. And it's just that
[6742.92s -> 6748.52s]  you're not bad at the champ. The matchup is just unplayable. You could put Faker,
[6748.52s -> 6753.20s]  If fucking goomy Aussie in certain matchups, and they will just lose they will lose the matchups
[6753.20s -> 6755.88s]  And it's because no matter how good your mechanics are
[6756.40s -> 6759.24s]  If the matchup is played correctly it doesn't it's not winnable
[6759.56s -> 6763.86s]  And that's why you see in pro play drafting is so important
[6763.86s -> 6767.50s]  It's perfect example of why in pro play drafting is 10 times more important than solo queue
[6767.50s -> 6770.80s]  And it's because when everybody plays the matchups correctly in shit, right?
[6771.30s -> 6774.67s]  When everybody's playing the matchups correctly in shits
[6775.83s -> 6779.27s]  The matchup like skill becomes a thousand times more important
[6779.27s -> 6785.17s]  Or like you know how the matchups being play like the champions become way more important
[6785.71s -> 6787.71s]  Whoa, what the fuck?
[6787.91s -> 6795.99s]  I'm on there. Just fuck them. What the hell is going on another little tip for you guys
[6795.99s -> 6798.75s]  Oh, I fucked that but another little tip for you guys is
[6801.55s -> 6804.53s]  melee champions or melee minions take
[6810.78s -> 6817.77s]  One turret shot two autos or sorry two turrets one auto and casters take one auto one turret shot
[6817.77s -> 6824.61s]  when you're under turrets like luck okay so learning this will be actually a
[6824.61s -> 6827.97s]  pretty good game to explain to you how to farm under the turret actually I was
[6827.97s -> 6829.89s]  thinking about like what I could teach you guys because we're just gonna get
[6829.89s -> 6841.12s]  shoved in a lot this game it's actually not that bad though so right now we
[6841.12s -> 6845.92s]  could actually space forward here okay that did not hit me that was BS but
[6845.92s -> 6862.21s]  sure I did the same thing I did last game man I did the same thing you
[6862.21s -> 6868.81s]  You see I walked up, it wasn't, it was a good fight but again, I keep doing that.
[6868.81s -> 6873.57s]  Where like I see the fight and I'll take the fight because I know it's a good fight.
[6873.57s -> 6878.56s]  But Lulu was too far back so I ended up just inting.
[6878.56s -> 6879.56s]  It's really stupid.
[6879.56s -> 6898.04s]  Like it was such a dumb play by me.
[6898.04s -> 6902.44s]  Cause I had to blow up both my sums right there because the Jhin, or I mean the
[6902.44s -> 6905.16s]  Jhin was in a really bad spot and the Karma was in a really bad spot because I
[6905.16s -> 6909.40s]  was level 3 and they were level 2 and they were walking up to contest waves.
[6909.40s -> 6914.76s]  my Lulu is behind me and when you're playing you know solo queue you have to
[6914.76s -> 6919.40s]  play as a team with your teammate okay so this Jin is kind of griefing right now
[6919.40s -> 6935.32s]  he's griefing by like walking up when I'm blue gunning him I don't know what
[6935.32s -> 6938.32s]  Lulu is doing I'm just killing that guy nice yeah they're they're griefing
[6938.32s -> 6942.28s]  really hard so the blue guns OP for what you just saw all you have to do with
[6942.28s -> 6945.28s]  the blue gun if you really want to just like have a funny ass overpowered
[6945.28s -> 6950.64s]  fucking when they're farming under the turret like that just hit the minions
[6957.89s -> 6970.52s]  okay we're getting ganked back up so i kind of did a cardinal sin there i would say like a sin of like
[6971.48s -> 6980.44s]  i overstayed a bit i think oh okay we'll fuck off dude that was greedy i should have back that
[6980.44s -> 6984.12s]  the turret but i didn't think karma was actually gonna do that but uh i did overstay because
[6984.12s -> 6987.92s]  Because you can see, like, this is the perfect example of why I overstayed, so they stopped my back, right?
[6989.12s -> 6991.52s]  I can give you guys a really good example of what just happened.
[6992.12s -> 6996.52s]  I overstayed, and when I overstayed, I didn't actually get anything out of it.
[6996.72s -> 6999.82s]  Like, I got, what, you see how I just have extra gold for nothing?
[7000.02s -> 7001.72s]  So now I just have extra gold, right?
[7001.92s -> 7006.22s]  And because I have extra gold, the Jinn actually gets a net positive because they stopped my back.
[7006.42s -> 7010.62s]  So he gets a free plate here, I miss a cannon, and even though I'm still up 10 CS,
[7010.62s -> 7017.12s]  It's like, I could have been up 10 CS, not given a plate and not missed a cannon.
[7017.12s -> 7023.16s]  So it's basically like, it's interesting.
[7023.16s -> 7024.96s]  Should you get Pryo for your jungler every game?
[7024.96s -> 7025.96s]  No.
[7025.96s -> 7029.94s]  No, that's not important.
[7029.94s -> 7031.74s]  Some games, Pryo is important.
[7031.74s -> 7034.10s]  It's very important some games.
[7034.10s -> 7038.06s]  But you don't need to always be thinking about getting Pryo for your jungler.
[7038.06s -> 7040.54s]  That's not something you should be like thinking about like always, right?
[7040.54s -> 7043.62s]  Like you think about it in terms of like timers.
[7043.62s -> 7049.62s]  important but prior for jungler always is not like something you should be worrying about
[7049.62s -> 7058.00s]  because if you're perma shoving and you're like oh I have prior for my jungler but then
[7058.00s -> 7062.32s]  your jungler doesn't do anything like having that prior would if you don't have prior it
[7062.32s -> 7070.29s]  doesn't do anything like I'd rather hold the wave in like a certain spot oh my god
[7070.29s -> 7109.24s]  I suck I mean it worked out I think if I was six I triple killed them there but
[7109.24s -> 7115.64s]  I think we actually triple kill them too if Lulu helps me, but again, you guys know what
[7115.64s -> 7117.12s]  I'm gonna say, I go back to the thing.
[7117.12s -> 7166.61s]  I don't know if Rengar has ulti or not.
[7166.61s -> 7183.03s]  I wanna shove this because chill.
[7183.03s -> 7186.27s]  I wanna shove it in for a second and I really don't have anything to do, so I'll just
[7186.27s -> 7187.27s]  stand here.
[7187.27s -> 7191.87s]  You wanna also be backed once it's hit for when you buy boots?
[7191.87s -> 7195.03s]  I bought boots, I felt like I was supposed to buy boots really early.
[7195.03s -> 7201.99s]  Champion where the more attacks you do is actually very valuable and positioning on a failure is very important. It's kind of like
[7202.83s -> 7207.43s]  Some AD carries like you don't need boots really early like like with like Jinx for example
[7207.43s -> 7213.95s]  I usually go free boots right or I go boots like after my Kraken but with a failure's I
[7215.03s -> 7217.83s]  Really like the early mobility the early trading
[7218.43s -> 7227.93s]  Stuff like that. Okay, so always be watching the map to we see the Rengar's top, right?
[7227.93s -> 7230.97s]  We can actually just straight fight these guys 2v2 right now
[7232.97s -> 7245.75s]  What wait what what's my Lulu doing homie what what are we he's alting us
[7256.73s -> 7258.73s]  So you're saying
[7258.89s -> 7271.78s]  Helping the ad carry is bad got it. I can't believe my Lulu just walked away from me and
[7272.50s -> 7275.70s]  Just like watched like you work as a team
[7275.70s -> 7286.19s]  This is something that I cannot stress enough. Play as a team when you play League of Legends.
[7286.19s -> 7291.87s]  This tilts me more than anything because this happens even in Grandmaster. I see teammates
[7291.87s -> 7299.75s]  who will be selfish and not help each other. Just help each other. Help each other please man.
[7299.75s -> 7311.29s]  we are a team. Don't just run and leave your ADC. Like, I'm not even flaming you, but like,
[7311.29s -> 7318.01s]  dude, you can't do that. You can't be upset that, like, I can't dodge every spell, right?
[7318.01s -> 7321.53s]  Welcome to the League of Dreams. I feel like something that I noticed that happens a lot
[7321.53s -> 7327.37s]  in League of Dreams is players will have this weirdly high expectation for everyone
[7327.37s -> 7334.01s]  to play absolutely perfect at all times and and they want me to like be goomy assi and
[7334.01s -> 7341.21s]  I'm like dude I dodged two of the gin bullets I dodged a karma queue like you literally like
[7341.21s -> 7353.14s]  I can't dodge literally everything will slow right like that's not how it works like
[7353.14s -> 7396.24s]  dude I'm gonna lose my mind with this guy my Lulu is blaming me it's okay it's okay
[7396.24s -> 7400.44s]  I don't need to be upset, it's fine.
[7400.44s -> 7409.02s]  The Lulu player is totally okay.
[7409.02s -> 7424.69s]  You know, sometimes people think they're right, it's just what happens in the worlds, right?
[7424.69s -> 7427.77s]  It's just, it is what it is.
[7427.77s -> 7428.77s]  No big deal.
[7428.77s -> 7445.90s]  Sorry, I'm trying really hard to not be an asshole right now.
[7445.90s -> 7450.42s]  This Lulu player is making me one of like fun Thanos.
[7450.42s -> 7451.26s]  You know what I mean?
[7451.26s -> 7454.42s]  Like this guy is like making me, like this guy,
[7454.42s -> 7457.70s]  like we talk about, like in League,
[7457.70s -> 7460.14s]  we talk about like the players,
[7460.14s -> 7463.18s]  like we talk about 80 carry players having ego.
[7463.18s -> 7467.70s]  I genuinely think support players have five times
[7467.70s -> 7469.86s]  the ego 80 carry players have,
[7469.86s -> 7475.58s]  but with like a third of the skill.
[7475.58s -> 7480.54s]  I think 80 carry players do have massive egos,
[7480.54s -> 7487.74s]  But again, I don't think that, like, I think support players are genuinely the dumbest motherfucking humans on the planet
[7488.24s -> 7490.74s]  and they think that they're the best players to ever touch the game.
[7491.54s -> 7493.14s]  And it hurts my fucking balls.
[7515.22s -> 7515.72s]  Hey, Lulu.
[7517.22s -> 7520.42s]  Would you be willing to have a...
[7521.62s -> 7522.32s]  VOD review...
[7523.72s -> 7526.02s]  with me in Discord after the game?
[7527.12s -> 7530.02s]  Let's just see. I wanna see if, like, this person is willing to listen to reason.
[7531.82s -> 7559.27s]  Let's see. I'm trying to not tilt, but it's really frustrating
[7560.81s -> 7564.03s]  Because this player is playing specifically for KDA and
[7565.45s -> 7571.25s]  They're playing like they don't understand how like I can already tell you if I go look at this person's OP.gg
[7571.43s -> 7574.93s]  They only play for KDA. I can tell you right now right here
[7575.25s -> 7579.43s]  This person plays only for KDA never takes any risks
[7579.81s -> 7585.37s]  Doesn't ever help their AD carry ever when they get behind doesn't ever to walk up to like try and fight
[7585.41s -> 7590.07s]  Doesn't do any of that. I can tell you right now without even looking at their OP.gg from how this person plays
[7590.45s -> 7593.63s]  That they have high KDAs, but really low win rate
[7594.05s -> 7600.72s]  But I don't want my entire stream to be beat bitching about this Lulu
[7600.72s -> 7602.72s]  So we'll try and focus on how to win from this position
[7603.38s -> 7607.86s]  So I'm sure you guys get shitty supports too. So we'll try and focus on how to win from the current position we're in
[7619.93s -> 7621.03s]  Yeah, it doesn't get better
[7621.03s -> 7626.87s]  I mean, I'll be honest with you my Grandmaster supports on my main suck like it doesn't get better
[7626.87s -> 7633.13s]  They get better like mechanically at the game, right like the higher elo supports get better mechanically
[7633.59s -> 7636.37s]  But they get work they don't get better when like
[7637.21s -> 7641.71s]  It doesn't get better. It's always like you'll either have a really good support or you have somebody who sniffs glue
[7642.07s -> 7650.77s]  I'm just dead
[7650.77s -> 7673.64s]  Or I'm not dead
[7676.86s -> 7683.42s]  Honestly our biggest issue here is I need to get blood thirst or ASAP once I get BT the game gets a lot easier
[7692.24s -> 7694.24s]  We could kill this guy right now
[7694.72s -> 7697.52s]  If the Lulu helps me, we can actually just straight kill these guys.
[7698.32s -> 7700.32s]  Because I can ulti to heal myself, right?
[7700.32s -> 7703.52s]  We have Lulu ult, I have ult to heal myself, and I'm strong.
[7704.72s -> 7711.52s]  She has ignite, I have ult, I have everything, we could easily kill that Taliyah right there.
[7713.52s -> 7714.92s]  I mean, yeah, whatever, man.
[7715.82s -> 7717.22s]  This is what I'm talking about.
[7721.38s -> 7727.08s]  Again, are you willing to get into Discord and Vod review?
[7727.08s -> 7742.80s]  Yes or no? I mean, I have to be honest with you. The reason this is frustrating is because
[7742.80s -> 7748.36s]  as an AD carry player, you want to be able to rely on your support, right? You want to
[7748.36s -> 7753.60s]  be able to make plays, go in, fight and rely on your teammates because as an AD carry player,
[7753.60s -> 7758.68s]  support and AD are like a duo, right? Like you want to play it together. No, no, man.
[7758.68s -> 7764.66s]  I'm not attacking you, I'm saying let's discord after.
[7764.66s -> 7776.06s]  You can explain your POV and I'll explain mine.
[7776.06s -> 7781.10s]  Maybe we can like improve this player, like get them to be a better player and not ruin
[7781.10s -> 7784.62s]  every game they play in.
[7784.62s -> 7804.00s]  That would be the goat, like that did not hit me by the way, that hitbox was BS.
[7804.00s -> 7810.16s]  I don't even understand.
[7810.16s -> 7817.16s]  Oh man.
[7817.16s -> 7825.45s]  This is the person's, by the way, this is the person's opi.gg.
[7825.45s -> 7832.27s]  Average win rate, 50% win rate, like I said, has really good KDAs on all his champs, but
[7832.27s -> 7834.71s]  he doesn't win.
[7834.71s -> 7840.57s]  I'm telling you right now, the biggest thing in League, the fAKEST thing in League of
[7840.57s -> 7846.57s]  Legends is believing that you are a good player based on KDA.
[7846.57s -> 7854.69s]  If I go look at any challenger level support player right now, their KDAs will be like 4.
[7854.69s -> 7861.45s]  They'll still have good KDA, but it'll be like 4 and 3, and it'll be on, that's your mutual.
[7861.45s -> 7867.69s]  I'm gonna be real with you right now, T. This Lulu player, like, you could tell me that
[7867.69s -> 7872.49s]  this person sniffed glue as a kid, and their parents never told them to stop, and I would
[7872.49s -> 7873.49s]  believe you.
[7873.49s -> 7876.45s]  I'm not even memeing, like I would say that makes sense.
[7876.45s -> 7882.73s]  I mean, like I said, I don't even care. I don't care if it's a girl a guy. The e-girl thing is like that doesn't bother me
[7882.73s -> 7887.49s]  Right like it could be a girl a guy a pigeon. They could they could fucking they could
[7888.05s -> 7892.97s]  Relate as a fucking peanut in a in a fucking plane. I don't care about that at all
[7893.33s -> 7898.09s]  You know, I mean like so that shit doesn't bother me at all
[7899.19s -> 7903.85s]  Like then be like I actually think it's stupid when people are like oh, it's an e-girl e-guy like I
[7903.85s -> 7907.67s]  I think that's dumb as shit because that argument's so crap
[7908.17s -> 7911.73s]  Because like I don't give a shit if it's a guy or girl because like you know what I mean
[7911.73s -> 7915.03s]  I'm more upset at the fact that this person is delusional than anything
[7915.85s -> 7917.69s]  That's like what's tilting me
[7917.69s -> 7930.28s]  Here I'm just gonna mute
[7930.56s -> 7935.72s]  We'll do one more game on this account after this game and I'm gonna mute from the start of the game for you guys, okay?
[7942.34s -> 7945.24s]  Dude if he didn't actually get me into the wall there
[7945.24s -> 7949.50s]  I tried to walk forward so that I wouldn't get condemned in the wall if he didn't stun me I kill him
[7950.10s -> 7953.10s]  Ah, that's annoying.
[7953.10s -> 7955.82s]  That was actually such a good hitbox for him.
[7955.82s -> 7970.55s]  My bad.
[7970.55s -> 7971.55s]  Nice.
[7971.55s -> 7972.55s]  Huge shutdown.
[7972.55s -> 7973.55s]  Nice job.
[7973.55s -> 7976.27s]  If you're wondering why I'm even here by the way, I'm actually, I'm not trolling.
[7976.27s -> 7979.51s]  I'm trying to get this turret because this gives me a lot of gold.
[7979.51s -> 7982.23s]  At the moment, I'm not actually worth that much gold.
[7982.23s -> 7983.35s]  There's nothing going on on the map.
[7983.35s -> 7985.31s]  There's no objective or anything like that, right?
[7985.31s -> 7990.35s]  So I'm trying to push in top waves right now so that I can get gold to try and like
[7990.35s -> 7994.27s]  hyper inflate my two item before this next dragon because this next dragon is
[7994.27s -> 7998.91s]  gonna be incredibly important if we if we want any chance to win we have to win
[7998.91s -> 8003.31s]  that this next dragon and the only way for me to do that is to either get really
[8003.31s -> 8008.95s]  lucky or go get some gold in a sidewind it's just support difference
[8008.95s -> 8014.25s]  every game it is I want to point this out this person is playing this victim
[8014.25s -> 8018.19s]  complex bullshit like you know what I mean but it is it is actually support
[8018.19s -> 8057.19s]  Sorry, I'm tilted. I'm playing bad this game.
[8057.19s -> 8062.19s]  I need to mute these players because these players are actually tilting me.
[8062.19s -> 8067.19s]  Like, I was fine with it before, but I'm actually getting a little irritated that's made me play bad.
[8067.19s -> 8070.19s]  So I need to mute them so I don't keep inting.
[8070.19s -> 8074.57s]  Like, it's affecting my gameplay and it's pissing me off.
[8074.57s -> 8078.01s]  That's just my bad.
[8078.01s -> 8088.27s]  T-Split, are you here? T?
[8088.27s -> 8091.27s]  Yo, T, message this Lulu.
[8091.27s -> 8097.47s]  I mean this in the nicest way. I don't even want to be toxic. I genuinely want to use this for content
[8100.81s -> 8102.81s]  Like this guy's been flaming me the whole game
[8103.13s -> 8109.33s]  Like I want to use this for content to show you guys that it is so easy to tell people how the game should be played
[8109.97s -> 8113.25s]  So easy if you if you can communicate by talking
[8116.75s -> 8122.23s]  Because this guy's been doing nothing but flaming me the entire game this little right, but he's an absolute
[8122.23s -> 8129.15s]  Like he played the lane completely bad, then he stopped trying to win, stopped shielding
[8129.15s -> 8134.13s]  me, stopped doing anything right after he played the lane bad.
[8134.13s -> 8137.21s]  Then he started playing the victim thing when I asked him to be a human and like come over
[8137.21s -> 8139.01s]  and like help me and play teamwork.
[8139.01s -> 8141.61s]  You gotta remember I didn't flame him a single time, right?
[8141.61s -> 8143.69s]  Like I didn't say a single negative thing to this guy in game.
[8143.69s -> 8145.73s]  I said let's work as a team.
[8145.73s -> 8146.73s]  He got upset.
[8146.73s -> 8154.99s]  Like I genuinely think it'd be great content if I could talk to this guy on discord.
[8154.99s -> 8179.68s]  just like oh I'd be so good right dude I'm trying to kill these people guys that
[8179.68s -> 8183.60s]  wasn't bad though we got 800 golden not the worst but I don't know if my team
[8183.60s -> 8192.26s]  can stall this maybe if they can like kill this they can stall it but no they're
[8192.26s -> 8235.38s]  yeah that's that's GG that was a disgusting Talia W I'm gonna add him
[8235.38s -> 8241.85s]  and he'll probably not add me but I might as well try this would be such a
[8241.85s -> 8255.69s]  good learning experience. Oh, excuse me. Dude, I've had like bad heartburn today. I need to take
[8255.69s -> 8266.87s]  one of those heartburn pills. What, Lulu? What, man? Just say it. Just let it out. Let it out.
[8269.75s -> 8284.79s]  Let it out, baby. Yo, Lulu, let's just have a talk. Yo, let's discord. We can bottom review
[8284.79s -> 8303.25s]  Since I'm so bad, trust.
[8303.25s -> 8315.26s]  You just blamed everyone but yourself, but you didn't play correctly at all.
[8315.26s -> 8327.28s]  You played lane completely wrong, didn't help each other, left people to die on repeats,
[8327.28s -> 8371.92s]  played victim. I genuinely want to help you. This guy screenshotted what I just said and put it in the
[8372.48s -> 8390.56s]  end game chat. What is happening right now? What is going on? There is no way that this is not
[8390.56s -> 8414.70s]  an NPC there is no way this is not an NPC there's no way there's no way it's
[8414.70s -> 8422.82s]  Geronimo the mouth it is me yes bro just come talk in discord I'm not even
[8422.82s -> 8436.21s]  gonna flame you what does this even mean bro I don't think I've seen
[8436.21s -> 8443.02s]  Anybody more insecure in my life, bro, you are so insecure
[8444.72s -> 8451.95s]  It's cringe how insecure you are like oof
[8453.45s -> 8457.89s]  Good luck man on the climb to masters, but
[8459.37s -> 8464.09s]  Jesus Christ
[8464.09s -> 8467.98s]  That's sad. Oh
[8468.14s -> 8469.86s]  God I
[8469.86s -> 8475.06s]  Dude, I don't even know what to say like I'm gonna be real. I was like, I'm not even gonna flame the guy, right?
[8475.06s -> 8479.04s]  I just genuinely want to like improve the community
[8480.82s -> 8485.10s]  Because that was three straight supports in a row that didn't know how to play Lulu and
[8485.74s -> 8490.58s]  I'm not even gonna flame the guy's skill. He's not a Lulu player, right? He doesn't play Lulu. That's fine
[8490.90s -> 8498.46s]  But the issue was that I had with that guy specifically was that it's okay to be bad at the game, right?
[8498.46s -> 8502.44s]  But there's nothing wrong with being bad at league, everybody has bad games.
[8502.44s -> 8505.52s]  But when we're playing a game together and you're saying it's winnable and you want to
[8505.52s -> 8512.22s]  win the game, you can't pick and choose who to like help win the game.
[8512.22s -> 8516.94s]  Like if I'm sitting there bot lane, we're both being dove by Jin and you're intentionally
[8516.94s -> 8523.02s]  trying not to take damage and not die because you want to value your KDA over everything
[8523.02s -> 8524.26s]  else.
[8524.26s -> 8528.62s]  So that I, you know what, hold on, let me think about this.
[8528.62s -> 8531.94s]  I think I figured this person out.
[8531.94s -> 8533.70s]  This person lives in delusion.
[8533.70s -> 8534.70s]  And I think I figured this out.
[8534.70s -> 8535.70s]  Let me, let me explain this.
[8535.70s -> 8538.78s]  A lot of players do this, but I think I'm figuring this out as I'm, as I'm thinking
[8538.78s -> 8540.34s]  about this.
[8540.34s -> 8544.90s]  So this person has really good KDAs on their profile, right?
[8544.90s -> 8548.74s]  This like this eye catching person, they've really, really good KDAs on their profile.
[8548.74s -> 8549.74s]  Right?
[8549.74s -> 8555.38s]  person doesn't ever take risks doesn't ever do anything to try and win the game
[8555.38s -> 8562.24s]  outside of like just existing and hitting buttons and what they do is they
[8562.24s -> 8567.20s]  will always have good KDAs and they will they will sit here and never like I know
[8567.20s -> 8570.28s]  why they're losing they will sit here and they will do this shit where they
[8570.28s -> 8574.68s]  have good KDAs they don't ever die that much blah blah blah but what they
[8574.68s -> 8579.72s]  do is they lie to themselves and they say look how good my KDAs are if I
[8579.72s -> 8589.62s]  had better teammates I'd always win. Like I cracked the code, actually. That's totally
[8589.62s -> 8597.00s]  what it is. The players actually like play so safe and they play for statistics, right?
[8597.00s -> 8602.36s]  They play like purely for the stats and then they can say that it was their team's fault
[8602.36s -> 8612.74s]  that they didn't win because they played really bad, but they didn't die. Because
[8612.74s -> 8618.18s]  Because I mean, in theory, I could have a perfect KDA on every AD carry I play.
[8618.18s -> 8623.02s]  All I'd have to do is literally walk up, get one kill, and then AFK and stand in the base
[8623.02s -> 8625.84s]  the rest of the game.
[8625.84s -> 8627.74s]  And I could be like, yo, why is my team not able to carry?
[8627.74s -> 8631.33s]  What's happening?
[8631.33s -> 8632.33s]  Right?
[8632.33s -> 8633.73s]  Well, you could literally do that.
[8633.73s -> 8637.21s]  No, I seriously think the person's self-gaslighting himself.
[8637.21s -> 8638.93s]  I'm serious.
[8638.93s -> 8642.89s]  I think this person's self-gaslighting where they're like, oh, it's my team's fault
[8642.89s -> 8643.89s]  every game.
[8643.89s -> 8649.39s]  Like they're always blaming their team for their their their loses and their mistakes and shits and it's sad because like
[8649.95s -> 8653.09s]  There's a reason you're D2 and I'm not saying that to be toxic
[8653.09s -> 8655.29s]  I'm saying that like you haven't improved in four years
[8655.29s -> 8660.79s]  And you haven't improved because all you're doing is playing to blame your team every single game when I just saw like
[8660.99s -> 8671.78s]  500 mistakes that you made that we could have won the game off of early game here
[8671.78s -> 8676.54s]  I remember somebody wanted me to play a Caitlyn game last game, so we're gonna play Kate I
[8676.54s -> 8680.84s]  I don't remember I don't remember who it was in the chat somebody's like two people said Kate
[8681.34s -> 8683.34s]  But we'll do a cake game for you guys. I
[8684.14s -> 8703.95s]  Got your boys. Don't worry. All right. I'm gonna take
[8704.71s -> 8710.39s]  Ghost flash because they have three melee champs for melee champs. They've they have for conzed clad Gregus
[8710.39s -> 8712.39s]  So I'm gonna take a ghost flash
[8712.99s -> 8714.75s]  These are gonna be my ruins this game
[8714.75s -> 8718.11s]  I'm gonna take a little more mr because I don't think we're gonna be fighting too much in lane
[8718.35s -> 8721.47s]  We're pretty much just gonna be poking them with karma Kate
[8721.47s -> 8726.03s]  So I'm going to take a little bit extra MR because I'm going to be playing for mid delay game. I'm just scaling
[8727.51s -> 8737.03s]  And these are gonna be the runes that I take
[8737.11s -> 8739.59s]  Even class on ad carry or the easier to play ones
[8740.19s -> 8745.15s]  In ad carry, I usually do like when I'm playing on this account right now. This is like my teaching account
[8745.87s -> 8749.75s]  It's a little lower MMR right? It's like D1 low masters. I usually
[8750.71s -> 8757.07s]  Play ad carries that like the chat wants to see me play so that you guys can learn like good and bad matchups and things like that
[8757.07s -> 8764.39s]  the last two games I got way too tilted by shitty support players like egos and
[8764.39s -> 8767.67s]  all that shit I got way too frustrated and I played bad the last two games so
[8767.67s -> 8770.99s]  we're gonna honestly I'm just gonna I think I'm just gonna mute these people
[8770.99s -> 8774.47s]  at the very start of the game normally I wouldn't suggest you meet people because
[8774.47s -> 8779.43s]  like playing as a team is really important because like you know you
[8779.43s -> 8783.27s]  need to communicate and all that shit but I am just like I'm gonna mute them
[8783.27s -> 8789.01s]  cuz I dude my mental is taking a fucking hit right now so we're gonna just chill
[8789.01s -> 8797.41s]  and play I I just don't know how to play Nila I think Nila's really good I just
[8797.41s -> 8804.66s]  don't I don't know how to play her I think she's a great champ like I've
[8804.66s -> 8809.06s]  been getting shit on by Nila on my main account like a lot of Grandmaster
[8809.06s -> 8822.02s]  Nila's have been dumbstering me I think she's just really good at abusing
[8822.02s -> 8827.30s]  solo queue like the the issue with Nila is from what I've seen all the
[8827.30s -> 8833.56s]  losses I've had with Nyla. It's like the thing I was telling you about before. People don't
[8833.56s -> 8839.24s]  play aggressively in the lower elos, like even in Grandmaster, people don't play aggressively
[8839.24s -> 8842.80s]  enough. It sounds crazy to say that, but it's true. They don't play aggressively enough
[8842.80s -> 8848.60s]  in lane, so you can get away with just picking Nyla and scaling. And Nyla at one item, you'll
[8848.60s -> 8853.30s]  always be up in levels, right? Because that's how the champion works. The champion works
[8853.30s -> 8860.18s]  like you'll always be up in levels because of her passive so you basically just like scale through
[8860.18s -> 8869.43s]  existing it's pretty it's pretty interesting all right so we're playing cake karma oh i missed
[8869.43s -> 8876.23s]  the minion because i suck i'm gonna ward this bush uh just because i don't want the recon in the
[8876.23s -> 8888.36s]  bush so now that the bush isn't warded anymore um okay he warded nice i was gonna say what i
[8888.36s -> 8890.36s]  What I want to do is I actually want to play-
[8890.36s -> 8893.54s]  Aw, I suck.
[8893.54s -> 8894.54s]  I actually wanted to play-
[8894.54s -> 8896.02s]  Oh man, I'm so bad at Cait.
[8896.02s -> 8900.46s]  I wanted to play on the top side of the wave so that I'm not standing near the bushes,
[8900.46s -> 8901.46s]  right?
[8901.46s -> 8905.70s]  Because if you stand near the bushes, the Rakan can obviously like W me and I just
[8905.70s -> 8907.06s]  get fucked, so.
[8907.06s -> 8908.66s]  I'd rather play in a safer spot.
[8908.66s -> 8912.82s]  I can't believe I missed 2 CS, I'm so fucking bad.
[8912.82s -> 8916.26s]  Now I want to push in wave 3 and I want to go buy a cull, so I'm going to ping
[8916.26s -> 8917.26s]  to push.
[8917.26s -> 8926.30s]  Okay.
[8927.02s -> 8931.80s]  So I actually want to back here and I'm gonna go buy a call so this is called a cheater recall
[8933.28s -> 8937.10s]  You usually have perfect CS to back on this timer
[8937.82s -> 8939.82s]  Go and you can go buy a call. Okay
[8940.34s -> 8944.34s]  This is like something that you can do if you're in a lane that's gonna be perma shoving
[8944.50s -> 8951.32s]  So what happens is the reason it's called a cheater recall is because we push the wave in they had to stay and form the wave
[8951.62s -> 8953.62s]  Right now watch
[8953.62s -> 8961.37s]  They have to push this wave in right now if karma was here instead of roaming this room is fine by the way
[8961.37s -> 8964.03s]  But if she was here instead of roaming she could actually hold the wave
[8965.15s -> 8970.43s]  And if you notice here, I don't actually miss that many minions right we're chilling now
[8974.95s -> 8978.91s]  We can so push this we're safe. I should actually fast push this
[8979.79s -> 8983.23s]  Because I wanted to bounce. I don't want to so push this but I can't I
[8984.19s -> 8987.63s]  Can't fast push this at level three by myself
[8987.63s -> 8993.63s]  So we're just gonna chill
[8994.69s -> 8997.71s]  Kaelin's really good at abusing like early lane phase
[8998.21s -> 9003.47s]  Bullying just based on like what our kit does we see where con on the map top side you get you see that's
[9004.47s -> 9011.15s]  So because we see where con I can walk up a bit and we can play a little aggro here
[9011.53s -> 9022.48s]  You can kind of see like I don't have to play behind the minion wave. You see what I'm doing to this guy, right? I
[9023.48s -> 9033.71s]  Hate this game. We can quit we can forfeit. It's fun. I hate this game. I really hate
[9033.73s -> 9041.06s]  this game. Dude, what is wrong with me right now? It's like my brain doesn't work. It's
[9041.06s -> 9052.38s]  the 280K nerf telling you. So, Rakan's gonna be bot right now. I know he's gonna be bot.
[9052.38s -> 9060.67s]  So, I need to be a little care. Now, my karma is here. There we go. So, you notice I didn't
[9060.67s -> 9072.20s]  use any spells. I'm just chilling. Dude, are you kidding me, man? I'm gonna be honest.
[9072.20s -> 9075.24s]  I'm getting really tilted by these players now.
[9075.24s -> 9080.96s]  Like the Recon W's in, they just stand there and watch me die.
[9080.96s -> 9082.56s]  Okay, it's fine.
[9082.56s -> 9084.28s]  Listen, I'm not going to get too mad about it.
[9084.28s -> 9085.28s]  It's fine.
[9085.28s -> 9086.98s]  I should have flashed the knockup, I guess.
[9086.98s -> 9090.50s]  Even though in reality I should never have to flash the knockup, but I should have
[9090.50s -> 9092.92s]  flashed it because I can't trust the teammates.
[9092.92s -> 9095.84s]  So what I'm saying is right there, Karma and Fiddle were both right here.
[9095.84s -> 9097.60s]  I was being chased down.
[9097.60s -> 9098.60s]  They stood here.
[9098.60s -> 9100.40s]  They didn't walk up to do anything.
[9100.40s -> 9103.14s]  They just stood and waited.
[9103.14s -> 9109.86s]  That pisses me off because I hate when players play selfish and scared.
[9109.86s -> 9114.27s]  It's my biggest pet peeve.
[9114.27s -> 9116.19s]  It drives me fucking crazy, man.
[9116.19s -> 9123.26s]  Sorry, I'm losing my mind.
[9123.26s -> 9124.26s]  It's so easy.
[9124.26s -> 9127.08s]  It's fine though.
[9127.08s -> 9130.08s]  I shouldn't have walked up and egoed it.
[9130.08s -> 9142.00s]  It's on me.
[9142.00s -> 9143.00s]  I want to soul push this wave.
[9143.00s -> 9149.53s]  Dude, I'm losing it.
[9149.53s -> 9157.25s]  This, by the way, would be an example of a bad time for Karma to run.
[9157.25s -> 9158.25s]  She needs to come back bot.
[9158.25s -> 9165.48s]  There's absolutely no reason for it to roam on that timer.
[9165.48s -> 9167.42s]  There's also no reason for it to be in that bush over there.
[9167.42s -> 9170.64s]  We should be playing up to try- we're playing Kate Karma, right?
[9170.64s -> 9174.16s]  We should be playing forward so that we can actually be aggressive.
[9174.16s -> 9175.44s]  Kate Karma's a lane bully lane.
[9175.44s -> 9177.00s]  We don't want to sit here and just do nothing.
[9177.00s -> 9180.32s]  If you pick Karma, you want to be aggressive, you want to be playing up, you want to
[9180.32s -> 9183.36s]  be stunning, you want to be doing like aggressive things, playing the game.
[9183.36s -> 9197.79s]  For level 6, I'd really like to like go in, yeah, like- that was actually not
[9197.79s -> 9198.79s]  bad by the Karma.
[9198.79s -> 9202.07s]  W'd the Zaya and then I got to trap off of it. So that wasn't too bad
[9203.35s -> 9224.26s]  Not the worst not not bad. That was good. That was good
[9225.44s -> 9243.77s]  Really nice really nice. Okay, so I'm gonna back here cuz I don't want to overstay for the wave. I'm gonna grab boots
[9245.85s -> 9249.68s]  You don't think a lot of it is to I
[9250.48s -> 9254.76s]  Think a lot of it is people get really scared when they like Rickon is really strong in this meta, right?
[9254.76s -> 9258.48s]  Like he's very very powerful. He's like numbers are a little too high right now
[9258.48s -> 9260.36s]  So like everything he does is just a little too good
[9260.72s -> 9266.24s]  So I think people get nervous around Rakan especially with Zaya because it's like when people would get nervous around non-milution
[9266.24s -> 9269.20s]  The lane like plays itself. It's very strong. It's very hard to beat
[9269.56s -> 9272.28s]  But you can still see people making mistakes when they play the lane
[9272.28s -> 9283.71s]  So you got to watch for that type of stuff now a good way to play against a Zaya once you hit six is
[9287.75s -> 9289.75s]  you don't want to
[9291.07s -> 9296.07s]  You don't want to ever walk melee range of her or give her the ability to just kill you with the feathers
[9296.07s -> 9301.61s]  your main goal here is gonna be try and stay in a good spot when it comes to
[9301.61s -> 9306.09s]  feathers like I want to be to the side of her the side of her is the best option
[9306.09s -> 9309.57s]  like where she can't pull in like I'll get hit by maybe a few but she can't
[9309.57s -> 9316.69s]  pull in all of them that's a really key thing when playing versus her because I
[9316.69s -> 9319.13s]  remember back in the day I didn't know how to play Versaia and I would always
[9319.13s -> 9323.41s]  get fucking frustrated this shit so Rakan's five I want to hit tab see
[9323.41s -> 9331.39s]  Rakan's 5. We shouldn't be able to die here. I want to push this wave in but I
[9331.39s -> 9336.90s]  also need to stay away from where the Rakan could be. So if you want to push
[9336.90s -> 9341.66s]  waves in and reset the wave make sure that you're standing as far away as
[9341.66s -> 9350.75s]  you can from where they can engage on you. Now they're about to be six Rakan
[9350.75s -> 9354.63s]  is. So they have a really strong level six. She has pickaxe and noonquiver. We
[9354.63s -> 9358.91s]  do want to be a little hesitant here. We don't want to fight. Now I'm
[9358.91s -> 9360.91s]  I'm gonna kind of push this in a bit
[9361.49s -> 9366.99s]  We should have been spam pushing the whole wave because that's okay karma plays. We just push push push push
[9367.83s -> 9371.35s]  But we played that that early roam by karma
[9372.59s -> 9374.59s]  Kind of put us behind on that
[9375.19s -> 9379.27s]  It's not a big deal. It's just something that we have to adjust
[9380.03s -> 9385.64s]  Why does this say 88 and this say 90?
[9387.90s -> 9408.39s]  Which one is it? Is it 88 or 90? I mean that guy's dead
[9410.03s -> 9415.88s]  Don't know what that karma's thinking, but we probably have to give this drink
[9415.88s -> 9422.44s]  I mean, maybe we could fight it if fiddle had ulti, but
[9423.16s -> 9432.36s]  Him not having all the others no way the higher one counts ward kills
[9433.40s -> 9435.40s]  Why I?
[9436.10s -> 9439.10s]  Think that's so stupid, so they might try and engage here
[9440.88s -> 9442.56s]  Unless they somehow know
[9442.56s -> 9446.12s]  Fiddles in the bush, which would be impressive because we know it's not warded
[9446.56s -> 9465.49s]  So that'd be pretty impressive if they knew that we could actually rift
[9472.10s -> 9473.38s]  I'm just gonna ghost.
[9477.26s -> 9479.36s]  This is crazy. What the fuck?
[9480.26s -> 9481.26s]  Oh, this is interesting.
[9486.24s -> 9487.34s]  They saw Fed 100%.
[9487.34s -> 9489.04s]  Yeah, I don't know where though. It must've-
[9489.24s -> 9490.44s]  Cause he used this thing.
[9491.94s -> 9493.94s]  But he'll use his, uh, whatever it's called.
[9495.92s -> 9496.82s]  His effigy.
[9497.62s -> 9498.42s]  I'd have to go look.
[9502.60s -> 9504.30s]  One million. Oh, I guess I didn't see it.
[9506.28s -> 9507.48s]  Uh, I should back.
[9507.48s -> 9508.48s]  I can get dove here.
[9508.98s -> 9511.18s]  We don't know where Gragas is. Like if Gragas happens to be like,
[9511.18s -> 9512.68s]  he eaves over this wall or something.
[9513.28s -> 9514.78s]  I can get dove really easy.
[9514.78s -> 9518.44s]  I'm greeting really hard greeting usually gets you killed
[9519.18s -> 9527.58s]  typically I shouldn't be doing this they're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right?
[9528.46s -> 9530.14s]  it's like
[9530.14s -> 9532.62s]  If you know something it's going to be a bad habit you should not do it
[9535.42s -> 9537.42s]  Just cue the bush
[9538.06s -> 9540.22s]  Okay, that was I meant use like an actual cue
[9543.34s -> 9546.22s]  They could also be in the alcove so i'm a little hesitant, but it's fine
[9552.22s -> 9556.22s]  Okay, so the reason I stayed was because now I have my uh, I have my medic, right?
[9556.90s -> 9561.06s]  Because we we finished the coal and we finished the mythic at the same time or finished the wave so
[9562.74s -> 9570.36s]  Now I have two options I go gale force here to dodge a lot of their shits or I can do what sounds like a fun option
[9571.74s -> 9573.74s]  We're gonna do shield though
[9574.14s -> 9577.02s]  I'm gonna show you guys why I like shield bow on Caitlyn
[9577.90s -> 9579.90s]  It's not the best mythic
[9579.94s -> 9582.34s]  But it's good into certain comps
[9583.50s -> 9585.50s]  If you don't want to get
[9587.74s -> 9589.74s]  Yeah
[9589.82s -> 9591.82s]  Because I have a lacquer do this game. I don't have bloodline right
[9592.78s -> 9604.41s]  So I kind of want to go shield bow and then i'm going to end up going uh either ie or i'm going to end up going
[9608.09s -> 9610.09s]  like bloodthirster seconds
[9610.09s -> 9612.09s]  ie or bt
[9612.33s -> 9614.33s]  probably ie just because uh
[9615.45s -> 9617.69s]  I think i think it's actually easier to go ie this game
[9624.72s -> 9628.40s]  But yeah, this is a kind of boring game. Our team's doing really well though. So we just chill
[9637.00s -> 9639.00s]  We got to be a little care
[9639.56s -> 9657.28s]  It was kind of hard to do anything there
[9657.68s -> 9662.12s]  Even though I got like a few autos on the Gragas. It's a little difficult to actually play the game there
[9662.56s -> 9672.52s]  Because if I walk up too far like see we're cons there if I walk up too far. I just get killed by Rakan
[9672.80s -> 9677.01s]  Alright, I'm just gonna reset and go get boots
[9679.78s -> 9682.10s]  Typically any carry is really fucking boring
[9682.82s -> 9684.82s]  in games like this
[9685.22s -> 9687.22s]  Where
[9687.22s -> 9697.27s]  You can't really blow the game open. Oh, I'm dead. Maybe wait karma shield me. I'm not dead
[9697.31s -> 9728.22s]  Nice. Fuck! Motherfucker co-read me, man. Here is like co-read. We can fight this though. They have no ults.
[9728.22s -> 9742.99s]  Like this is actually fightable. They have no Zyar and no, uh, Gragasar. And this is also why it's
[9742.99s -> 9747.79s]  really important that you relay to your team the cooldowns of your team. Remember that. Don't
[9747.79s -> 9752.27s]  forget that. If somebody uses a big cooldown, tell your team. Because that was an illegal
[9752.27s -> 9756.31s]  Dragon right like they just that was one of the most illegal things I've seen in
[9756.31s -> 9779.92s]  the while homie completely griefed that that's another very very very important
[9779.92s -> 9783.50s]  thing that you need to take away from playing league and being like this is
[9783.50s -> 9787.78s]  what I was saying about the teamwork and shit earlier being good at the game is
[9787.78s -> 9793.06s]  a lot of spreading knowledge as well right like if you if your team doesn't
[9793.06s -> 9795.98s]  know if a flash is up or down you have to play completely differently right
[9795.98s -> 9798.70s]  like you got to think about the game in that in terms of that as well
[9798.70s -> 9800.70s]  like how many times have you seen like
[9800.70s -> 9804.14s]  you know you're like oh i can walk up here if this guy can't flash ult me or something right
[9808.07s -> 9812.38s]  it happens all the time
[9812.38s -> 9832.10s]  i wonder if i can kill a duskblade zed i don't know i probably could uh i should go med
[9835.27s -> 9838.23s]  what do you think about timo and other top lane as ad carry
[9840.26s -> 9843.30s]  i play timo ad carry when i'm playing for fun sometimes
[9844.42s -> 9855.03s]  it's okay yoga look on your game man
[9856.31s -> 9860.31s]  so during the mid game as katlyn uh a few things that i can kind of teach you
[9860.31s -> 9863.43s]  This was kind of a boring lane phase right like we didn't really do that much
[9863.99s -> 9869.11s]  The lane phase was essentially just like we died once and then you know everything all hell broke us
[9870.15s -> 9872.15s]  When you're walk up the fights like this
[9872.71s -> 9875.03s]  Make sure that you're putting traps down in places
[9877.34s -> 9885.02s]  Where the enemy has to walk just like that
[9885.90s -> 9890.06s]  Playing 80 playing Caitlyn is not always about just like autoing and getting cues and shits
[9890.46s -> 9893.98s]  If you noticed during that fight, I put two traps here two traps here
[9893.98s -> 9898.02s]  I forced the enemy team into like a location where they had to eat traps or
[9900.33s -> 9901.57s]  they
[9901.57s -> 9904.21s]  They can't find us right and even if like
[9904.77s -> 9912.72s]  They avoid the traps. They're still having to like move their character in a very unique specific way that they
[9913.28s -> 9914.86s]  Probably don't want to do
[9914.86s -> 9921.23s]  So you should always be thinking where should I put these traps down at the start of fight?
[9921.23s -> 9928.33s]  Not like how do I get autos off think about using your traps to zone and to like control the team fight before the fight starts rather than using it to
[9928.33s -> 9934.49s]  to do damage because they'll step in the traps themselves.
[9934.49s -> 9936.65s]  People will just, people are stupid.
[9936.65s -> 9937.65s]  They're bad.
[9937.65s -> 9938.65s]  People aren't paying attention.
[9938.65s -> 9939.65s]  Everything.
[9939.65s -> 9940.65s]  I'm bad.
[9940.65s -> 9941.77s]  You know what I mean?
[9941.77s -> 9945.85s]  People can't pay attention to every bush that you're putting traps in during a big fight.
[9945.85s -> 9947.53s]  It's too much attention span.
[9947.53s -> 9961.75s]  Nobody has it.
[9961.75s -> 9964.12s]  Nice.
[9964.12s -> 9967.51s]  I'm gonna go grab this red.
[9967.51s -> 9970.15s]  Oh, big tip for all the AD carries in chat.
[9970.15s -> 9971.15s]  Guys.
[9971.15s -> 9972.83s]  I'm gonna tell you right now.
[9972.83s -> 9978.31s]  Once the 20 minute mark happens in league, your jungler's camps are no longer his.
[9978.31s -> 9981.15s]  I know, I know junglers are gonna hate me for this, okay?
[9981.15s -> 9983.99s]  Listen, if you're a jungle player and you're like, fuck this guy now, I hate him.
[9983.99s -> 9985.59s]  Listen, you know it's true.
[9985.59s -> 9991.19s]  You know at 20 minutes your camps no longer, like, they're not yours anymore, man, okay?
[9991.19s -> 9994.23s]  Like you, you, you are full items at this point, okay?
[9994.23s -> 10000.48s]  Like, I want to be honest, you would, I'm taking your camps.
[10000.48s -> 10014.49s]  I'm trying to get my 3rd item as fast as humanly possible because AD carries spike on 3 items extremely hard.
[10014.49s -> 10024.73s]  I want to walk top, but we have no vision of this area so it's a little scary.
[10024.73s -> 10034.22s]  Like I said, I typically don't like to take jungles camps early game, ever.
[10034.22s -> 10039.22s]  That's why I say at 20 minutes, usually you have 2 items at this point.
[10039.22s -> 10042.22s]  If you're farming decent, etc.
[10042.22s -> 10046.22s]  Sometimes it'll be faster, but usually it's around average.
[10046.22s -> 10074.58s]  Always be tabbing to the teamfights even if you're farming as well. Zed is in this bush
[10075.26s -> 10081.66s]  Wait, where is he? Wait, I'm stupid. Where'd he go? Oh?
[10082.66s -> 10084.66s]  He died I killed him
[10085.38s -> 10094.73s]  Wow, I'm really smart. I like didn't notice that I killed that guy
[10095.87s -> 10097.55s]  I'm so dumb
[10097.55s -> 10111.18s]  80 carry brain right boys. I was like playing that so scared too cuz I was like I was like is he there
[10112.50s -> 10122.98s]  Pull the dragon out
[10122.98s -> 10128.50s]  Oh, I asked this yesterday, but what do you guys think the coolest looking dragon is? I swear it's the
[10130.10s -> 10132.10s]  I think mountain Drake looks fucking sick
[10169.46s -> 10171.82s]  Here you shall like time to push man, right?
[10173.42s -> 10181.98s]  That's mainly because we are karma just got picked off and I don't want to give them the option of pushing the wave
[10181.98s -> 10207.54s]  So by pushing the lane nice by pushing the the lane in it takes away an option for the enemy
[10207.54s -> 10210.58s]  That's something that a lot of people think like oh, I just want farm
[10210.58s -> 10214.98s]  I don't care about the farm right like when I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game
[10215.34s -> 10216.94s]  and I'm pushing like a
[10216.94s -> 10220.82s]  Mid mid wave in before a fight if we're just sieging around the Baron
[10222.10s -> 10226.62s]  Having that wave pushed in gives them gives us another option. I'm like what we can do in the game
[10227.26s -> 10229.66s]  And it takes you three seconds to push it in so
[10230.46s -> 10232.46s]  if the fights already over and
[10232.46s -> 10240.44s]  And you have time always be paying attention to like trying to push in waves so that you can create a little bit of that pressure
[10240.62s -> 10242.78s]  Yo, hail. Thank you so much for the 14 man. Welcome back
[10243.70s -> 10246.18s]  What do I get next I kind of want to get BT
[10246.98s -> 10251.43s]  I'm gonna get BT I
[10251.43s -> 10256.39s]  Could get Dom's but I think BT's better because the I already have over here, right?
[10256.39s -> 10262.11s]  So the shield from BT plus shield vote plus IE. I don't think I'll be able to die. Okay. I think I'm unkillable
[10262.11s -> 10266.27s]  Act- actually, like actually unkillable.
[10266.27s -> 10269.23s]  So here I'm gonna actually give these camps to Fettel cause he's literally pathing to
[10269.23s -> 10287.30s]  them I don't want to be an asshole but- wow.
[10287.30s -> 10288.50s]  What just happened?
[10288.50s -> 10290.74s]  I'm bad.
[10290.74s -> 10294.54s]  I feel like I got hooked by Kled.
[10294.54s -> 10296.22s]  Oh he flashed.
[10296.22s -> 10297.22s]  Okay.
[10297.22s -> 10301.34s]  I was like- I feel like what just happened was like I mispositioned cause like I went
[10301.34s -> 10304.38s]  up here right like I ghosted and went up here cause there was two people here
[10304.38s -> 10305.46s]  two people here.
[10305.46s -> 10311.02s]  I put traps down these kind of sloppy traps and then I positioned here and then clad flash cued me under the yeah, okay
[10311.02s -> 10312.46s]  That makes sense
[10312.46s -> 10313.74s]  I'm just bad
[10313.74s -> 10317.72s]  It was okay though because
[10317.72s -> 10322.35s]  if the entire enemy team has to literally
[10325.23s -> 10330.35s]  Like double flash on you to kill you under the turret and then your team follows up. It's not that big of a deal
[10331.07s -> 10333.07s]  Gale force would have saved me there though. Actually
[10334.47s -> 10340.52s]  Loki Gale force totally gonna save me
[10341.40s -> 10343.40s]  Because he has serpents
[10343.40s -> 10350.23s]  Serpent's definitely shits on Shilbo. I'm kind of stupid for going Shilbo this game.
[10353.23s -> 10363.23s]  I wanted to try it out because I, when I, before when I was playing Caitlyn, like before the IE rework and everything, everybody would go, uh, or there was like one guy in Challenger would go Shieldbow into shit every game.
[10364.23s -> 10370.23s]  And I wanted to see if like, it was still viable, but there might just be better options now, like Always Scale Force, uh, BT or something.
[10374.52s -> 10375.52s]  Oh my god, I flashed late. I'm dead.
[10375.52s -> 10386.27s]  late. I'm dead. Dude I flashed late for some reason. I'm so dumb. My bad. I was giving
[10386.27s -> 10395.19s]  an Mb. Like my brain is moving slowly. Like I can feel it turning. I'm just playing bad.
[10395.19s -> 10399.19s]  Like I was baiting the Kled to go in on me because Karma was there. But what I need
[10399.19s -> 10404.27s]  to do is I need to trap on top myself when he goes in. Then I need to flash Nett and
[10404.27s -> 10405.27s]  And the Kled just dies.
[10405.27s -> 10410.52s]  You can also just kill him.
[10410.52s -> 10415.84s]  I was gonna say, they have nothing.
[10415.84s -> 10416.84s]  We just play for dragon here.
[10416.84s -> 10423.96s]  I don't know why I'm playing so bad today.
[10423.96s -> 10424.96s]  I played bad yesterday too.
[10424.96s -> 10425.96s]  I don't know what's going on.
[10425.96s -> 10427.96s]  My brain is broken.
[10427.96s -> 10459.57s]  Dude, that recon was trying so hard.
[10459.57s -> 10487.67s]  Oh, I've made so many mistakes this game.
[10487.67s -> 10499.47s]  I fucked up positioning, mechanics, farm, all kinds of shit.
[10499.47s -> 10502.07s]  Uh, I still don't want Lord Dom's, actually.
[10508.49s -> 10509.93s]  I don't think Lord Dom's is good this game.
[10512.43s -> 10513.67s]  Like they have no armor.
[10513.97s -> 10515.37s]  Like Kled has merc treads.
[10517.17s -> 10518.17s]  Which I feel like
[10520.07s -> 10521.47s]  really bad indoor team, but
[10531.42s -> 10533.42s]  Oh, a little tip that you guys can have for Caitlyn too.
[10534.22s -> 10535.32s]  When you are
[10536.32s -> 10538.12s]  like barons up in 50 seconds, right?
[10538.22s -> 10541.72s]  So a little thing you can do that's actually kind of fun is
[10541.82s -> 10543.52s]  you want to be at the objective before the like
[10543.52s -> 10559.52s]  Rule of thumb, when an objective is coming up, you always want to be on that side of the map before the objective comes up, but you can put down traps in the bushes around the objectives and people will face check them and you can just one tap them away game.
[10561.52s -> 10563.52s]  It's actually incredibly fun.
[10563.52s -> 10578.16s]  Like you just put them in the corners of the bushes where people have to walk. Like right here I can put it right between the turret.
[10578.16s -> 10591.20s]  I don't know why I didn't ghost.
[10591.20s -> 10597.29s]  I'll be honest, I have no idea why I didn't ghost.
[10597.29s -> 10602.87s]  I was like saving it for something, I'm not sure what.
[10602.87s -> 10605.49s]  Next year, a birthday present, who the fuck knows?
[10605.49s -> 10613.12s]  Oh I could have one shot that guy if I was better at Cait.
[10613.12s -> 10618.70s]  I did a really classic combo right there, I just didn't Q because I'm bad.
[10618.70s -> 10621.86s]  I should have, when he hit the trap, your two headshots, sit on him for a few seconds,
[10621.86s -> 10624.66s]  so what I should have done is I should have instantly Q'd on top of the trap,
[10624.66s -> 10626.62s]  then auto-auto'd and he would have died.
[10626.62s -> 10630.90s]  your Q does the max damage when they're trapped too so it would have been like just a perfect
[10630.90s -> 10631.90s]  three shot.
[10631.90s -> 10636.10s]  But like I said I don't play Kade enough and my muscle memories kind of trash sometimes
[10636.10s -> 10638.82s]  so that was my bad.
[10638.82s -> 10674.93s]  Oh we're getting cluttered I don't know where he is but I shouldn't have done that.
[10674.93s -> 10677.41s]  I'm limit testing really hard right now.
[10677.41s -> 10680.09s]  I suggest you guys don't limit test well actually I do think you should limit
[10680.09s -> 10683.53s]  test but not if you want to win like play safer like right there the play wasn't to
[10683.53s -> 10684.85s]  go back in.
[10684.85s -> 10690.96s]  The player was like back off, but I wanted to see if I could like, I wanted to see if
[10690.96s -> 10693.76s]  I was terrible or not.
[10693.76s -> 10695.26s]  You know?
[10695.26s -> 10696.26s]  I was.
[10696.26s -> 10701.98s]  But yeah, I mean the combo with Kate is like if they're trapped, you want to queue while
[10701.98s -> 10707.50s]  they're in the trap essentially because your auto will always give you the range.
[10707.50s -> 10714.04s]  So if you auto and then queue, when they're trapped they get, not a lot of people know
[10714.04s -> 10721.12s]  this because I just found this out like a few years or like after I should have when
[10721.12s -> 10726.28s]  you queue on top of a k trap the way k is q works is when you queue the initial like
[10726.28s -> 10731.20s]  it hits initially and then it does less damage to the targets behind it right it's very narrow
[10731.20s -> 10736.12s]  and then it likes it like gets bigger so when they're trapped though it does the
[10736.12s -> 10740.52s]  maximum q damage that it can do in like the isolation of the queue so that's why
[10740.52s -> 10746.57s]  why when people are trapped you want to open up with your queue. You either want to net
[10746.57s -> 10753.71s]  into the queue and then double auto, or you want to net, or you want to queue, then trap
[10753.71s -> 10759.51s]  net at the same time, then double auto. It's a very interesting way to play. You always
[10759.51s -> 10764.23s]  want to try and overlay a trap on your trap. So when they get trapped, you can overlay
[10764.23s -> 10768.79s]  a second trap to either in front of them or behind them. And what will happen is
[10768.79s -> 10770.43s]  is there's actually like a little mini,
[10770.43s -> 10772.95s]  like I wanna say one second cooldown
[10772.95s -> 10774.03s]  of being able to be trapped, right?
[10774.03s -> 10776.35s]  Like a little 1.52 second cooldown.
[10776.35s -> 10778.19s]  But what can happen is that you sit in the trap,
[10778.19s -> 10780.27s]  then what you can do is your net can slow them,
[10780.27s -> 10783.07s]  so you can actually queue in the first trap,
[10783.07s -> 10784.95s]  then you can drop a second trap,
[10784.95s -> 10786.75s]  net slow them into the second trap,
[10786.75s -> 10788.23s]  and then triple auto headshot them
[10788.23s -> 10791.07s]  from all three of the two traps.
[10791.07s -> 10796.92s]  It's really complicated sounding,
[10796.92s -> 10805.59s]  but this man does redeemed end my stream
[10805.59s -> 10806.63s]  whenever you want.
[10813.22s -> 10823.57s]  What why? Why would you want to end my stream right now?
[10829.25s -> 10831.25s]  Why would you want to be that guy?
[10831.35s -> 10852.88s]  Wow, okay, don't you don't end just change the camera position
[10854.20s -> 10863.49s]  Did you just spend one million points to tell me to put the camera back on the right side of my fucking
[10868.92s -> 10870.92s]  No way
[10871.80s -> 10880.46s]  No way you just did that. I was like this man is just flexing
[10880.92s -> 10885.44s]  He's just like, yeah, I got some points to spare. I guess I could like throw him, you know
[10886.32s -> 10902.45s]  All right, fine. There's that better
[10903.29s -> 10910.04s]  Is that better?
[10910.04s -> 10917.01s]  Drink water. Actually, that's a good one. I'll be our B. I'm gonna get some water. Should we play in our main?
[10917.01s -> 10919.01s]  I kind of want to try and hit GM
[10919.93s -> 10923.41s]  Yeah, let's get on our main account. It's like 1 p.m. So it's like 3 p.m. Eastern. I
[10924.29s -> 10925.65s]  think I
[10925.65s -> 10927.69s]  Can get cues at the moments
[10927.69s -> 10934.37s]  Let me get some water and then we'll queue up or we'll queue up then get some water real quick
[10934.71s -> 10946.48s]  Because I think I think it's late enough than day. I can get cues now without waiting 40 minutes
[10952.62s -> 10957.40s]  By the way, it is it is a teaching stream when I'm doing that like 80 carry Academy thing
[10957.40s -> 10960.48s]  So if you guys have any questions you want to ask or like you guys can ignore that
[10960.72s -> 10962.72s]  If you guys have any questions you want to ask or anything like that
[10963.64s -> 10966.44s]  You know if we're just chilling between games just ask whatever you want
[10966.44s -> 10970.42s]  I I can answer a lot easier between games that I can't in game
[10970.42s -> 10974.20s]  You know it's a lot easier for me to see that shit. I try and answer in game
[10974.20s -> 10977.66s]  But like sometimes I'm like focusing and shit, so it's a little harder
[10984.69s -> 10988.01s]  I'm gonna get some water though, so I'll be right back. Okay
[10989.09s -> 10991.09s]  Talk amongst yourselves
[10991.25s -> 10994.73s]  Is Kraken troll on Kate? No Kraken's good on Kate
[10995.57s -> 11001.65s]  You can go Kraken into bloodthirster or Kraken in the IE if you really need it if if they have like tanks
[11001.65s -> 11003.65s]  so they have like Scion
[11003.65s -> 11006.99s]  So 20 stuff like that that you have to like you're the only damage
[11006.99s -> 11011.89s]  So say you're like the only tank killer on the team. You're the only 80 damage you have to go cracking sometimes
[25507.26s -> 25525.18s]  a
[25525.18s -> 25531.18s]  a
[25531.18s -> 25533.18s]  a
[25533.18s -> 25535.18s]  a
[25535.18s -> 25537.18s]  a
[25537.18s -> 25541.14s]  a
[25541.14s -> 25543.14s]  a
[25543.14s -> 25546.90s]  a
[25546.90s -> 25550.21s]  a
[25550.21s -> 25562.24s]  Smurf. Why is this player in my game? Why is this player in a 400LP Master game? Why?
[25562.24s -> 25571.65s]  Or rather, why am I in a Diamond 1 game? You can go to his previous games, he doesn't
[25571.65s -> 25578.45s]  even have good MMR. Like if you look at these games, they're all like 100, 200LP, right?
[25578.45s -> 25584.25s]  Why am I in this game? Why did you put me in a game with this player? Like this guy,
[25584.25s -> 25588.45s]  I don't even care if he sucks. I'm more frustrated at the fact that these players
[25588.45s -> 25591.49s]  mental boom at the first sign of any negativity. Look at this.
[25592.93s -> 25596.13s]  They just give up. First sign of anything negative, they go next.
[25597.81s -> 25600.85s]  Like, I actually could have 1v9ed this game too. Like, actually.
[25601.41s -> 25606.13s]  But I'm not allowed to try and 1v9 because my team wants out of the game at fucking four minutes
[25606.13s -> 25614.05s]  or 15 minutes. That sucks, man. The new system is trash. Like, I'm sorry, but the
[25614.05s -> 25618.53s]  But the 4-5-15 system is good sometimes.
[25618.53s -> 25622.37s]  They should have a requirement that you have to be losing by x amount of gold for it to
[25622.37s -> 25624.37s]  kick in.
[25624.37s -> 25626.09s]  That should be it.
[25626.09s -> 25627.81s]  They should have a requirement.
[25627.81s -> 25634.46s]  You have to be losing by 5k plus for it to work at 15.
[25634.46s -> 25639.66s]  Like there needs to be something where there's a requirement because people are
[25639.66s -> 25641.90s]  so stupid, right?
[25641.90s -> 25643.94s]  Like that game was 100% ours.
[25643.94s -> 25648.18s]  We had two dragons, we're down 2,000 gold at 16 minutes,
[25648.18s -> 25651.82s]  and Wukong's three and one, we were down four kills.
[25651.82s -> 25657.02s]  Wukong's three and one.
[25657.02s -> 25660.52s]  I'm literally insanely strong.
[25661.50s -> 25663.46s]  Even though we got weak-sided, I'm still winning.
[25663.46s -> 25665.54s]  We just 2v2'd them bot side of the map, right?
[25665.54s -> 25666.78s]  We just won a 2v2.
[25668.54s -> 25672.26s]  Rumble's just like, like, ah, sorry, I'm just mad,
[25672.26s -> 25673.10s]  I'm mad.
[25673.96s -> 25677.06s]  Like, they need to require something other than
[25677.06s -> 25681.74s]  People like require four people and a gold lead or something like that's so cancer
[25684.62s -> 25691.58s]  That's so fucking frustrating men like I can't believe how bad people's mentals are
[25692.82s -> 25697.76s]  Like the okay, I get it the the rumble and the the rumble in the nocturne
[25697.76s -> 25702.40s]  I understand wanting to forfeit. Okay. Okay. They're having a bad game. They want out. They're raging
[25702.40s -> 25705.40s]  They need to get their frustration. I get it, but why are we forfeiting?
[25708.96s -> 25711.56s]  When wukong is three and one I
[25711.56s -> 25716.76s]  I have seven of our KP. I'm the 80 carry. I'm very strong. I just got my mythic
[25717.34s -> 25719.34s]  We have two dragons and
[25720.00s -> 25722.28s]  Rickon's forfeiting to I don't know man
[25726.28s -> 25735.88s]  That's just frustrating is all like I'll be real I carry this game every day of the week
[25737.16s -> 25768.41s]  Like every day of the week I carry those so apparently riot is doing something about smurfing though
[25769.03s -> 25771.03s]  And I can't wait until they do
[25772.11s -> 25776.81s]  This is actually a really good thing that I wanted to talk about earlier in the stream, but I forgot
[25777.65s -> 25783.07s]  Apparently riot is like doing something to make smurfing harder because like apparently smurfing is outrageous right now
[25783.07s -> 25787.45s]  And I kind of think that they need to stop this too
[25788.23s -> 25792.51s]  so there's a there's a thing you can do in solo queue right now where
[25793.39s -> 25797.75s]  You can make a new account and you can duo with somebody on
[25799.19s -> 25801.19s]  different accounts on a new account
[25801.71s -> 25804.51s]  And your MMR doesn't actually get like
[25805.59s -> 25810.23s]  lowered so if you win a game
[25810.95s -> 25812.95s]  Let's say you win a game
[25814.23s -> 25815.91s]  I
[25815.91s -> 25821.07s]  Think this is just him wobbling the account, but let's say let's say you win a game and in that game you
[25821.95s -> 25828.04s]  Do it with somebody in a lower MMR right now when you do it in a lower MMR
[25828.04s -> 25829.32s]  I don't know if this guy did this or not
[25829.32s -> 25836.64s]  but when you deal with somebody in a lower MMR your MMR is based on now the game thinks that you're in that MMR and
[25836.64s -> 25838.64s]  You can do it in placements
[25838.76s -> 25845.32s]  So in your very first games for some reason there's no MMR lock on placements. So you can in your placements
[25846.56s -> 25848.56s]  Do it with somebody who's like
[25849.04s -> 25856.06s]  Bronze right and you can play with them and then the game thinks you're still winning so it keeps amplifying your MMR
[25856.06s -> 25863.02s]  So when I'm describing this really poorly, but essentially you can duo in lower elos and the game doesn't know your MMR
[25863.30s -> 25869.62s]  Belongs in that elo because you're winning in that elo the game can't figure that out for some reason the algorithm
[25869.90s -> 25874.58s]  So when they stop duo queuing it still inflated them
[25874.82s -> 25878.34s]  It's still inflated their MMR to where it would be if they had solo queued
[25878.78s -> 25880.78s]  Does that make sense and what I'm saying?
[25881.42s -> 25884.78s]  So it basically says that they went like 10 and 0 in their placements
[25884.78s -> 25891.74s]  right so now they're in like a master tier MMR from a brand new account so now
[25891.74s -> 25897.22s]  those people are in like D1 masters MMR but they played they won in gold I
[25897.22s -> 25910.33s]  also don't think you smurfing should be so easily accessible like this guy's not
[25910.33s -> 25914.65s]  a bad player per se but I don't think he's a master tier player right like
[25914.65s -> 25918.93s]  this guy's a rumble player on a new account I from that game alone the fact
[25918.93s -> 25941.85s]  he gave up tells me he's not a good player dude I'm a heavy
[25941.85s -> 25947.17s]  advocate for like Riot hat you have to attach like a verification to your
[25947.17s -> 25952.49s]  accounts I know Riot would never do that but I'm like a heavy advocate for
[25952.49s -> 25958.25s]  like having to attach verification to play ranked I think it'd be great
[25958.25s -> 25975.77s]  honestly I think it would help so much if you get your very very
[25975.77s -> 25979.67s]  count Vander you done for it yeah you have to get like a VPN to play other
[25979.67s -> 25985.65s]  Like you would have to that's my point though like if you get your verified account banned
[25986.79s -> 25989.43s]  Right like okay that counts done
[25989.93s -> 26009.48s]  Like I said, I don't think Riot would ever do it because it's too it's too
[26010.84s -> 26015.28s]  Extreme and I don't think Riot has the balls to ever do that shit VPNs only five dollars
[26015.60s -> 26018.56s]  Yeah, but dude, are you gonna tell me that you're gonna you're gonna buy it?
[26019.56s -> 26024.60s]  People who get banned on accounts typically get banned consistently. That's why they're making smurfs
[26025.64s -> 26026.64s]  Right?
[26026.64s -> 26032.52s]  So you're telling me somebody's going to be willing to pay $5 for a new phone number verification
[26032.52s -> 26036.16s]  or whatever every time they have to make a new account?
[26036.16s -> 26047.68s]  They're not.
[26047.68s -> 26048.68s]  Not you, me.
[26048.68s -> 26051.76s]  Lulu, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[26051.76s -> 26052.76s]  Don't I have smurfs?
[26052.76s -> 26053.76s]  Yeah, I do.
[26053.76s -> 26058.96s]  And I stand by all my smurfs should be attached to the same, like, account.
[26058.96s -> 26064.56s]  Like, if you make a smurf, okay, this is what I think should happen.
[26064.56s -> 26067.48s]  You should be able to put all of your smurfs on one account.
[26067.48s -> 26073.94s]  So you can make smurfs and you can add that smurf verification to an account.
[26073.94s -> 26074.94s]  But it kind of like battle.net.
[26074.94s -> 26075.94s]  Does that make sense?
[26075.94s -> 26080.12s]  You know how like battle.net has all your accounts in the battle.net thing, but you
[26080.12s -> 26082.14s]  can sign in to battle.net?
[26082.14s -> 26087.38s]  I think that the way to make it viable would be like you could put all, if you didn't
[26087.38s -> 26091.22s]  have a second phone number or didn't want one, you could put smurfs up to like a
[26091.22s -> 26092.22s]  limit.
[26092.22s -> 26095.18s]  three smurfs, or like two smurfs in your main account, right?
[26095.18s -> 26097.38s]  So you could have like three total accounts
[26097.38s -> 26099.90s]  and you would have to like, you could add those
[26099.90s -> 26102.78s]  to the same like Omega account, right?
[26102.78s -> 26105.42s]  And that Omega account could be your verified account.
[26105.42s -> 26107.50s]  Now, if any of your accounts get punished
[26107.50s -> 26115.28s]  on your Omega account, all of your accounts get punished.
[26115.28s -> 26116.60s]  So if any of your accounts get punished,
[26116.60s -> 26130.02s]  all of them get punished.
[26130.02s -> 26132.26s]  Like I feel like that'd be a good play.
[26132.26s -> 26134.26s]  Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like it would work.
[26134.26s -> 26135.50s]  Yo, what's up Rush?
[26135.50s -> 26140.99s]  That calls you Rush, what's up RF?
[26140.99s -> 26142.99s]  What do I want to play I
[26145.07s -> 26149.28s]  Don't know what I want to do here
[26150.00s -> 26154.68s]  Okay, I wish I didn't have cleanse cleanse is so worthless this game. We actually
[26156.40s -> 26158.40s]  Cleanse does nothing this game at all
[26159.00s -> 26165.92s]  I just down a sum like maybe if the brand like tries to flash stun me or some shit, but I'm just like down a summoner
[26166.28s -> 26180.34s]  All right boys
[26180.34s -> 26186.43s]  We got night blue three on our team. This is a throwback
[26192.75s -> 26260.58s]  him oh we got him I'm not gonna lie I kind of looked like I was scripting that
[26260.58s -> 26265.46s]  that movement like if I was watching the game I'd be like what the fuck was that
[26265.46s -> 26271.38s]  like my movement was real sauce on that like that that all in right there that's
[26271.38s -> 26306.99s]  him that's some there's some sus movement we can gank these guys they
[26306.99s -> 26321.26s]  have no oh there's gonna be a warden here these people have no flashes
[26321.26s -> 26324.76s]  Enemy bot lane has no flash. This should be a free kill, honestly
[26326.12s -> 26329.92s]  We just let these guys push in they can't walk up and we just play for that
[26334.76s -> 26347.79s]  Even if they try and 3v3 we should just win the 3v3 because we're stronger. Oh, this guy's just dead. Yeah, it's I
[26358.40s -> 26360.40s]  need level three I
[26363.04s -> 26365.04s]  Kind of fucked my entire wave here
[26366.08s -> 26378.51s]  Yo, can we push? Is there any way we can just push this? Oh nice
[26378.51s -> 26405.10s]  Nice. Nice, well played. Nice job. My Lulu's fucking fetish shit. Oh I should have gone
[26405.10s -> 26413.62s]  free boots this game. I didn't even think about it. Cuz uh, I don't need Sork this game.
[26413.62s -> 26418.74s]  You know how like the last game I told you I was going boots? I went boots for the uh,
[26418.74s -> 26423.90s]  you know the fast boot to rush for Thresh. I don't need that this game because we
[26423.90s -> 26430.26s]  We just went through like faster mythic.
[26430.26s -> 26433.74s]  So I should have gone free boots for like more efficiency.
[26433.74s -> 26445.06s]  Can't understand, and I could just kill a man.
[26445.06s -> 26469.37s]  You can't understand, and I could just kill a man.
[26469.37s -> 26473.33s]  I want to push this wave so we don't get like shit on.
[26473.33s -> 26505.91s]  I'm gonna just kill a man, and you can't understand.
[26505.91s -> 26507.91s]  Just kill a man.
[26507.91s -> 26514.95s]  Kill a man, there is something you can't understand
[26515.95s -> 26516.95s]  Kill a man
[26544.35s -> 26559.28s]  Hmm, I could go back here, but I don't see any reason to go back yet. I think I'm dead
[26565.34s -> 26569.34s]  I misplayed that that was actually really good by Lula cool dance. No, you're fine, man
[26569.34s -> 26574.34s]  I wish I could I wish I could tell him that he played it fine. I messed up not him. I messed up
[26576.72s -> 26584.65s]  I feel bad. I want to like say no you're fine because that was my bad
[26585.65s -> 26589.33s]  I should have- okay, so when I flashed and I was running away from the twitch, right?
[26589.33s -> 26592.69s]  The second that twitch flashed on me, I should have instantly started autoing him.
[26593.41s -> 26597.01s]  Like, I- and it was one extra auto. Like, one single extra auto.
[26597.01s -> 26602.92s]  And it would have been fine. Why can't I tell her?
[26606.18s -> 26607.94s]  You know, I just choose not to type anymore.
[26608.98s -> 26613.36s]  It's my choice. You know.
[26615.59s -> 26620.61s]  Yeah. My choice.
[26639.54s -> 26641.54s]  Oh, that guy's actually doing that, huh? Wow.
[26644.55s -> 26646.31s]  We win 2v2 really fucking hard.
[26646.31s -> 26668.18s]  Especially with tier 2 boots, but I need uh, dude I'm doing some scripty shit. I'm gonna be real
[26669.04s -> 26678.88s]  Dude Lulu wasn't six. I thought she was six. I'm so bad. I
[26681.74s -> 26685.24s]  Wish I could tell her my bad again. I'm actually trolling
[26686.14s -> 26689.84s]  like I ran out of mana because I'm bad and then I
[26690.78s -> 26695.12s]  And then I thought she was six
[26695.12s -> 26699.40s]  So I walked up to like take tank deterrent for a second right because I was like, oh shit
[26699.40s -> 26704.52s]  Maybe I'll get like maybe we can kill this guy. Maybe Lulu has a spell or something. I just oh I played bad my bad
[26710.58s -> 26712.14s]  W that make sure
[26712.14s -> 26722.33s]  Echo's not there. I feel I actually just feel so bad because the Lulu is actually playing really this like the best support
[26722.33s -> 26723.49s]  I've had all day
[26723.49s -> 26725.49s]  Like this guy's actually impressing me right?
[26725.89s -> 26727.89s]  Like this guy's playing really well
[26727.97s -> 26760.82s]  And I'm just griefing
[26760.82s -> 26765.54s]  Lulu gave her life for me
[26765.54s -> 26772.36s]  Lulu gave her life for me boys. Can we get a salute for Lulu and chat boys?
[26773.40s -> 26778.18s]  Do we get a salute? Can we get some blood for Lulu?
[26779.90s -> 26788.52s]  She gave her life for the homie.
[26803.95s -> 26806.85s]  Honestly, that was a really cool 2v2 by the way.
[26808.47s -> 26812.63s]  Oh, Night Blue's smurfing it. What the fuck? Yo kill that bitch too.
[26829.41s -> 26839.99s]  Nice.
[26839.99s -> 26841.99s]  No, oh.
[26841.99s -> 26846.99s]  If I lost that cannon, I would have lost my life in-game.
[26846.99s -> 26878.69s]  I'm gonna go BT second item.
[26878.69s -> 26879.69s]  We have Lulu.
[26879.69s -> 26883.45s]  So, wait, what the fuck is this pathing?
[26883.45s -> 26885.81s]  I clicked to go bot and it pats me in the weirdest spot ever.
[26885.81s -> 26886.85s]  We have Lulu.
[26886.85s -> 26893.13s]  So I could actually go IE second, but I think if I go BT, I'll be actually unkillable.
[26893.13s -> 26897.28s]  Like it'll be the greatest thing ever.
[26897.28s -> 26900.48s]  I actually still might go IE as I'm thinking about it out loud by saying we have Lulu
[26900.48s -> 26905.76s]  and not be stupid but hey I guess don't might you know I still might go IE but I
[26905.76s -> 26949.78s]  don't know yet we'll see cuz I took a Lackardy so it's like wow no I mean I
[26949.78s -> 26957.80s]  don't know why I flashed away I'm playing bad it's my fault I think the
[26957.80s -> 26961.32s]  game's over so I'm just I'm playing bad I'm like limit testing a little bit
[26961.32s -> 26973.01s]  much today.
[26973.01s -> 26993.86s]  Nightblue help!
[26993.86s -> 27025.59s]  Help!
[27025.59s -> 27028.96s]  Help!
[27028.96s -> 27041.81s]  Bum bum.
[27041.81s -> 27043.81s]  Bum bum bum bum.
[27043.81s -> 27055.89s]  Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.
[27055.89s -> 27057.89s]  The prize they haven't forfeited though. What the fuck?
[27057.89s -> 27059.89s]  Dude! How does this game?
[27059.89s -> 27061.89s]  Oh, I'm even more mad.
[27061.89s -> 27063.89s]  You guys have no idea.
[27063.89s -> 27065.89s]  So, I...
[27065.89s -> 27067.89s]  It's 24 to 8.
[27067.89s -> 27069.89s]  The enemy team doesn't forfeit.
[27069.89s -> 27076.73s]  forfeit but my team forfeits when the score is 10 to 14 and we're only down a
[27076.73s -> 27102.94s]  thousand golds sorry I was that was my bad I was tilted by you know I was thinking
[27102.94s -> 27108.02s]  about about how they weren't forfeiting and I was getting mad it is a little
[27108.02s -> 27111.22s]  interesting because I said they still can't win so I don't know who the fuck
[27111.22s -> 27114.82s]  setting no but it's probably echo well no echoes definitely heading no but like
[27114.82s -> 27115.82s]  Who else?
[27115.82s -> 27121.67s]  Maybe Brands?
[27121.67s -> 27122.67s]  Maybe Riven.
[27122.67s -> 27123.67s]  Maybe Riven's like, yeah.
[27123.67s -> 27128.84s]  They did just get a thousand gold.
[27128.84s -> 27137.06s]  Alright, I should probably stop trolling.
[27137.06s -> 27140.22s]  I'd feel pretty silly if we lost because I'm bad.
[27140.22s -> 27143.54s]  After we like dumpstered him and lain that hard, I'd feel pretty silly if we lost because
[27143.54s -> 27144.54s]  I keep getting caught.
[27144.54s -> 27163.52s]  Alright, I should be unkillable now.
[27163.52s -> 27166.90s]  Like, I'm not even farming.
[27166.90s -> 27169.06s]  I'm actually griefing.
[27169.06s -> 27171.38s]  I should probably go make dinner after this game.
[27171.38s -> 27174.82s]  I want to keep playing because I'm playing well today, but like dude, my brain is
[27174.82s -> 27179.14s]  starting to go like I probably need to go make some food I'm getting the full
[27179.14s -> 27201.01s]  ADHD brain experience going so let's see if I can muster all my focus let's see
[27201.01s -> 27205.25s]  if I can muster up all my focus really quick just for push out and finish this
[27205.25s -> 27213.19s]  game we'll go terminator mode for the the end of this game right now we'll
[27213.19s -> 27226.41s]  muster up all of the all of the focus demon mode engaged voice god that was
[27226.41s -> 27279.57s]  sounded really cringe I'm actually really impressed though and I played this
[27279.57s -> 27287.06s]  game really really well like I'll be honest my last like thought of night blue was him
[27287.06s -> 27303.92s]  being bad at league he played this game really well my man's gotten so much better okay nobody
[27303.92s -> 27308.34s]  saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody
[27308.34s -> 27313.06s]  saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that not one of you saw me flash after the echo
[27313.06s -> 27325.64s]  didn't I one of you wasted flash no that was assertive flash an assertive
[27325.64s -> 27338.00s]  dominant flash not wasted at all they might actually go for Baron here we
[27338.00s -> 27350.52s]  should look for this like they could try oh he's here pretty sure the ribbons
[27350.52s -> 27357.84s]  here too though yep I did not mean to do that I didn't mean to hit the thing I
[27357.84s -> 27359.40s]  I accidentally hit the blast plans.
[27360.90s -> 27361.98s]  That was an accident.
[27361.98s -> 27363.92s]  It was a literal pure accident.
[27366.79s -> 27369.81s]  Like I did not mean to hit it.
[27369.81s -> 27371.65s]  I was like, I know Riven's here.
[27371.65s -> 27374.21s]  I'm gonna wait for Yasuo before I go over
[27374.21s -> 27375.21s]  or before I do this, right?
[27375.21s -> 27376.37s]  And I'm gonna bait him.
[27376.37s -> 27379.57s]  And I just completely whiffed every, like I'm bad.
[27379.57s -> 27380.69s]  We'll leave it at I'm bad.
[27380.69s -> 27382.49s]  That's a good way to put it, I'm bad.
[27382.49s -> 27385.05s]  I'm hungry, I'm old, I'm bald, I'm bad.
[27385.05s -> 27386.05s]  Nothing else to say.
[27387.13s -> 27388.73s]  Short too, short and bad.
[27402.75s -> 27405.55s]  Yeah, that was a pedestrian flash.
[27406.75s -> 27412.15s]  It is she as well. Oh yeah, it's it's a plethora, a plethora of terrible things.
[27416.66s -> 27418.26s]  I still got to go to the gym tonight, too.
[27443.03s -> 27444.13s]  Zed's bot.
[27444.63s -> 27445.23s]  Okay.
[27446.13s -> 27448.23s]  I'm a little nervous of like getting flanked.
[27449.43s -> 27451.73s]  Right. Their junglers could just like sit in places.
[27469.10s -> 27470.80s]  Nice. We got top in him. Not bad.
[27471.90s -> 27473.60s]  Yeah. I mean, we just try and get mid and hit here.
[27473.60s -> 27475.60s]  Oh
[27475.60s -> 27477.60s]  Let's go help our homie though
[27477.72s -> 27500.58s]  Like I'm actually so sad. I'm playing so bad
[27501.90s -> 27506.58s]  Like I was playing so good at the start and now I'm playing so bad. That actually makes me sad. I
[27516.05s -> 27518.05s]  Was tanking for that guy?
[27529.16s -> 27542.35s]  Alright, let's just leave. I don't want to I don't want to throw the game for my my teammates
[27542.79s -> 27544.79s]  Cuz like I'm getting like, you know
[27546.99s -> 27575.44s]  I've already died five times like a dipshit. Oh where'd he go?
[27575.80s -> 27583.40s]  We should just push bot honestly
[27584.68s -> 27596.12s]  We don't even need this dragon
[27596.12s -> 27598.12s]  Fuck it. We just I'm just gonna push bot
[27643.96s -> 27658.62s]  Not bad
[27658.62s -> 27663.30s]  Not bad at all. I gotta give it to I want to give it to night blue, but I got to give it to this Lulu
[27664.34s -> 27671.31s]  Lulu played that game so good. I got to give it to Lulu. She played so fucking good
[27676.02s -> 27693.61s]  Like actually, I don't even know if she's still in here
[27693.61s -> 27733.61s]  I'm not a scripter she thinks I'm a no I'm serious she thinks I'm a
[27733.61s -> 27763.80s]  scripter bro I'm streaming it did the homie thought I'm a scripter you know
[27763.80s -> 27777.95s]  I'll take it my ego feels good honestly that feels good that feels good
[27777.95s -> 27787.00s]  hi well that I was a script dude I'm not gonna lie though some of those
[27787.00s -> 27791.92s]  movements were sus as fuck that I was making like I was I like I like turned
[27791.92s -> 27796.44s]  on the fucking mental scripts for that game some of those movements early were
[27796.44s -> 27804.00s]  nuts like like just like this tiny little tiny little movements I was doing
[27804.00s -> 27809.00s]  early game and lame were crazy like look at this watch this like this movement
[27809.00s -> 27819.53s]  right here right like look I dodged that right then I walk up cleanse the
[27819.53s -> 27833.48s]  thing kite down like that that movement is gross man look that was actually
[27833.48s -> 27840.64s]  some gross ass movement I'm not gonna lie we this in the corner man in the
[27840.64s -> 27851.36s]  corner my brain was like yo andromeda thank you man yo you played really good
[27851.36s -> 27857.80s]  now I felt bad I felt so bad because I was grieving like I was like at the
[27857.80s -> 27862.64s]  At the start of the game, we were just snot- like I literally fucked up like three times
[27862.64s -> 27865.52s]  during like the really important fights and I was like, oh no.
[27865.52s -> 27871.84s]  Yeah, thank you for the bits.
[27871.84s -> 27872.84s]  Can I play Callista?
[27872.84s -> 27878.29s]  Uh, I can.
[27878.29s -> 27881.97s]  I'm trying to figure out if I want to play a Callista game or if I want to go make
[27881.97s -> 27889.21s]  dinner.
[27889.21s -> 27892.09s]  There was one other movement that I thought was kind of nuts.
[27892.09s -> 27898.78s]  I did a really good movement too, somewhere, I don't remember what it was.
[27898.78s -> 27900.14s]  Here's where I fucked up.
[27900.14s -> 27905.58s]  So right now I should have just been, for some reason my brain lagged and I should have just
[27905.58s -> 27911.58s]  been sitting here, I should have just cleansed and then started fighting the twitch.
[27911.58s -> 27915.46s]  For some reason I didn't cleanse, but this wasn't like your fault at all.
[27915.46s -> 27919.26s]  The second the twitch flashed, I should have insta cleansed the ignite and I should
[27919.26s -> 27923.02s]  have just been killing him right now, just like autoing because I can't get away from
[27923.02s -> 27924.02s]  him, right?
[27924.02s -> 27930.09s]  But it took me an extra second, see how I started fighting him now?
[27930.09s -> 27936.17s]  I barely died. I wouldn't have died had I cleansed and had I just turned initially it was fine
[27936.97s -> 27946.36s]  And then like here I fucked up too because I went in and I thought we were six. Oh
[27954.40s -> 27956.40s]  I could have killed that guy. I
[27957.04s -> 27960.80s]  Should have gone forward one more. Oh, you know what? I should have done there
[27960.80s -> 27963.44s]  I should have gone forward one more auto killed this guy
[27963.68s -> 27968.16s]  Lulu would have gotten six off of the kill. I would have used my speed to come back out
[27968.32s -> 27970.56s]  Then she could have altered me. We could have killed the uh
[27970.56s -> 27974.52s]  We could have got the twitch and then we could have turned on this echo too. Oh
[27981.82s -> 27984.30s]  This was a really cool 2v2. I
[27985.58s -> 27987.58s]  Actually thought this 2v2 was really sick
[27992.51s -> 27996.67s]  Lulu is a real one for this man. Listen. You're a real one for this one
[27997.27s -> 27999.59s]  You just took the death to save me
[28004.66s -> 28006.22s]  respect
[28006.22s -> 28008.14s]  Your real one for that
[28008.14s -> 28019.31s]  That was so good
[28019.31s -> 28022.51s]  Jesus was fun. Yeah, geez. You were the best support I've had today
[28022.51s -> 28028.35s]  Like legitimately you played better than all the other players in the silo. That was really good. Like I was surprised
[28028.35s -> 28033.73s]  I was telling my stream. I was like, yeah, this she's actually like they I said she cuz you're a little I don't know
[28033.73s -> 28035.73s]  You know, but I was like, yeah
[28035.99s -> 28039.51s]  She's playing super good. She's playing way better than all of my fucking teammates
[28044.36s -> 28046.08s]  Yo
[28046.08s -> 28048.08s]  What time is it six?
[28048.42s -> 28053.86s]  Man, do I want to do I want to keep streaming or do I want to go or do I want to go get food and go to the gym?
[28053.86s -> 28059.12s]  I can't like 24 hour fitness is not actually 24 anymore
[28059.40s -> 28068.04s]  So I'd have to go soon if I'm gonna go to the gym, but it is only like six
[28077.97s -> 28079.21s]  hmm
[28079.21s -> 28083.22s]  But I could just end on I
[28084.18s -> 28088.40s]  Could just end on the hitting the like 400 LP mark and just chill for now
[28091.19s -> 28093.97s]  Right like we had 400 LP. We'll probably hit GM tomorrow
[28095.67s -> 28098.43s]  So I could just chill for now and then we just hit GM tomorrow
[28098.43s -> 28107.99s]  That's probably a better idea because then I won't get mad like say say we get like like say we get another game like this, right?
[28109.33s -> 28114.31s]  Like say we get another game like this where like we're literally winning the game and my team's like no
[28114.31s -> 28117.91s]  Let's forfeit like that's gonna make me mad. I was mad. This is gonna make me mad, right?
[28117.91s -> 28118.79s]  Like I
[28118.79s -> 28123.19s]  So I'd rather just like get off on a good note like a happy note. You know like not be tilted
[28123.59s -> 28133.58s]  GM tomorrow. Yeah, I hope so. I've been I think I can get challenger back this year
[28133.58s -> 28139.58s]  but we got to get to GM first I'm telling you I this elo is so miserable like
[28139.86s -> 28146.66s]  Master tier is the worst elo. I've ever played in in my 12 years of
[28147.10s -> 28149.10s]  playing this game
[28149.34s -> 28153.28s]  Whatever NA 300 400 LP Masters is is
[28154.38s -> 28156.38s]  Literally disgusting
[28156.38s -> 28163.10s]  These these are not real people like I feel like half these games. We are playing with NPCs
[28163.58s -> 28170.86s]  who quite literally don't even, like I don't even know what to say, they're bots.
[28170.86s -> 28176.22s]  And they can't be real humans, they get mad over nothing, they rage quit over nothing, they
[28176.22s -> 28182.97s]  give up at 15 minutes when we're winning the game, these cannot be real people.
[28182.97s -> 28189.25s]  So I swear to God, the game has to get better in GM, it has to get better.
[28189.25s -> 28193.37s]  There's no world that it gets worse.
[28193.37s -> 28195.37s]  I refuse to believe that
[28195.81s -> 28203.78s]  Because this is this is the worst grind I've ever had is it bad to be a bot?
[28204.22s -> 28209.94s]  Are you saying I'm bodiced?
[28209.94s -> 28214.84s]  Are you gonna cancel me because I because I because I don't like bots. I said it. I'm saying it
[28214.84s -> 28216.84s]  I don't like fucking bots. Well
[28217.30s -> 28221.24s]  Okay, I didn't need to add fuck it. You know what? We're just gonna I'm gonna get off. I'm gonna yeah, that's it
[28221.24s -> 28222.84s]  That's it for me
[28222.84s -> 28228.66s]  I'm gonna get off voice. I'm tired. I need to go to the gym before I run out of juice make some dinner
[28228.66s -> 28234.46s]  I will be live tomorrow same time as today. I've been starting my stream at 10 a.m. My time
[28235.50s -> 28240.90s]  Maybe I'll do it tomorrow at 9 a.m. I don't know it's 10 or 9 1 between there
[28240.90s -> 28242.90s]  I always start my stream and so
[28243.42s -> 28247.04s]  And that's my time so it's like seven eight nine PST
[28247.82s -> 28251.62s]  You're good at it. Thanks, man. I think I suck my goal is
[28252.62s -> 28258.62s]  Hopefully I can get challenger back and then I'm not gonna play like I just want to
[28258.66s -> 28261.38s]  My goal is Challenger so that I can prove to myself
[28262.34s -> 28266.82s]  It's a really stupid thing, but I want to prove to myself that I can still do it at 32
[28267.38s -> 28270.42s]  Because 10 years ago was the first time I started streaming this year, right?
[28270.42s -> 28272.10s]  I've been streaming for 10 years this year
[28272.74s -> 28274.74s]  And so I want to get Challenger
[28275.22s -> 28279.06s]  Because when I first started streaming I was in Challenger and I want to see if like after 10 years
[28279.14s -> 28282.02s]  I can still do it
[28282.02s -> 28284.02s]  And then I'm never going to care again
[28284.58s -> 28287.14s]  This will be the only time I ever give a shit about getting Challenger
[28287.14s -> 28290.72s]  I just want to get it see if I care and then play for content, you know
[28292.34s -> 28296.54s]  But uh, yeah, it's just it's like welcome to the league of Draven
[28297.38s -> 28300.80s]  See if the old man who has fucking arthritis and
[28301.54s -> 28305.14s]  Fucking carpal tunnel and all that shit, you know what I mean see if I can still do it
[28306.74s -> 28309.82s]  Yo, thank you for the twitch prime man. I appreciate it. Thank you so much
[28310.42s -> 28311.70s]  Appreciate it a lot dude
[28311.70s -> 28313.42s]  All right guys, that's gonna be it for me
[28313.42s -> 28317.74s]  If you like the stream, don't forget to follow all my socials and tiktok and Facebook and Instagram and all that shits
[28317.74s -> 28320.82s]  All the clickable garbage is underneath the stream. Don't forget to check it out
[28322.06s -> 28324.24s]  I'll be back tomorrow same time in the morning
[28325.06s -> 28329.02s]  I tomorrow's my last day for the weekend though. I'm not gonna stream on Saturday
[28329.02s -> 28335.34s]  I might do some off off stream grinding on Saturday. I've been taking I've been like forcing myself to take a day off of streaming
[28335.82s -> 28341.38s]  Every week just so like I can mentally recharge and I think it's actually been really good for my stream
[28341.38s -> 28344.74s]  because like I've been in a much better mood while streaming and I've been much
[28344.74s -> 28349.22s]  less tilted and I've been even if I play League of Stream or whatever it's just
[28349.22s -> 28352.78s]  like it doesn't feel as forced so I feel like the break's nice so yeah
[28352.78s -> 28357.10s]  tomorrow no stream on Saturday tomorrow for sure and Sunday I might I might do a
[28357.10s -> 28360.94s]  short stream but yeah I'll see you guys then thanks for watching I appreciate
[28360.94s -> 28369.38s]  you guys and yeah that's it I'm gonna go make dinner oh we guys have a good
[28369.38s -> 28373.62s]  night day wherever the fuck you are later dudes hope you guys have a good
