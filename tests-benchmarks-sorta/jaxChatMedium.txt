{'text': " Let's talk about Open Assistant. Sure. So start from the beginning. Well, we saw that there was a lot of movement in this space. Chat GPT came along and everyone's like, who are chat GPT and so on. And yeah, I think it was it. I mean, it was both a surprise and a not surprise for people. The capabilities of chat GPT weren't a surprise, but obviously the success of it, I think too many of us was. It's like, okay, we knew we could build such chat conversational like things, but we didn't know how much people loved them. There's a bit of I think, wasn't, didn't Sam Altman maybe was that who said in an interview, well, anyone could have built this using our API before, but no one did. So you know, we did, which is not true, because they distinctively forbade, like you building an app that had unfiltered access to the API, essentially, open ended apps. I think they explicitly forbade that, right. So that it's a wrong statement that anyone could have built this using our API, because hadthey tried, you would have shot them down, right? But in essence, the capabilities were there. And it's still in the restriction now. Unless they've changed it, they do not allow open ended applications, which seems like an oxymoron to me, because a language model is inherently open ended. Yeah, but I can I mean, I can see their the restriction being like, you know, you're not allowed to build an app that just lets users freeform query our app, you need to either do some filtering or do some heavy prompting around it so that it's like for one particular purpose, I can see that I can totally get why they do it. But then at the same time saying anyone could have built chat GPT is like no chat GPT is very like if I could imagine an app that has like unfiltered, unfettered access to the API through an app, it's chat GPT. In any case, there was obviously a lot of and then I think pretty soon people came up with this idea, hey, could we do something like that? Open source, they had a bit of an older paper called instruct GPT, or that described a model called instruct GPT that where they sort of outlined how we think chat GPT was done, approximately. No one knows.But and at that point, we also saw, hey, the amount of data to be collected is actually in reach. It's not immense, humongous, and so on. It's actually okay, and couldbe done. So at that point, yeah, a lot of people wanted to do something open source like, and I think a bunch of us just came together and felt we could do it. So we built this platform where people could come and contribute to the data set, which was really cool to see that people actually came and amazing. Open source. Well, well, the point is, the point is, there were a lot of ideas around as well of, oh, let's just collect, you know, scrape Quora on scrape Reddit, right, and that will serve like as training data. It's true to an amount, right? But it's very clear, at least to me, that the capabilities of these models, the chat models, they come from the underlying language model. And the biggest claim to that I have is that OpenAI said they used crowd workers from low wage countries to do their data input. Yet, the first examples of chat GPT that flew around were like, Oh, look at it solving this quantum physics problem and so on. Now, I'm not saying that there aren't any good quantum physicists in in other countries, right? But the people who typically go for like a low wage crowd worker job in these countries, they probably aren't experts in quantum physics. And they also certainly weren't paid to go get a degree in it, just so they could answer that one question. So to me, it's very clear that the capabilities comefrom the underlying model from the next token prediction pre-training. And then all the human data does is kind of it gets it into this mood of being an assistant, right? Gives it lots of examples of here is how it's like, you know, going through an apprenticeship or something like this, where you've lived your life, right? You've grown up, you've consumed the world and so on. And then you start your first job and someone tells you, look, here is how you behave towards customers, right? You're friendly, you know, if someone asks this, you do it like this, here is a thing, here is how our system works. And so you get introduced to that. But your competence of justliving and doing things comes from yourself, for life and not from that one person who introduces you to how the store works and how you should behave towards customers. So my big conviction was always we should really collect this data from humans and the goal should really be diversity. So the goal and if you just say, well, we'll just scrape,,000 of this, then to me that certainly is going to do something, right? It's good data probably, but it's a bit missing the point. If you want a general assistant, you need as general data as you can get. And only human data so far has been able to achieve that level of diversity and generality. And it was proven, like, okay, I'm biased, but I think it was proven right a little bit in that if you look at the data set, the prompts that human write, like what they want to know what they want the model to do, it's so diverse. It's insane. And so we built this platform, where essentially you as a human, you can come and you're always presented with like one task and the task could be right to prompt, right. But the task could also be here is an already existing conversation between a human and an assistant. And now it'sthe assistant's turn. And now you play the assistant. Please write your response. It could also be, here is the last message of the conversation. It's the reply by theassistant. Please rate it. Like label it. Is it spam? Is it a troll? Is it funny? Is it appropriate? Does it fulfill what the human wanted out of it? And so that's howwe constructed the data set that we collected over like 600,000 inputs of such that being text or labels or rankings of different things. And yeah, that's that resulted in in this data set over 13,000 people contributed to the dataset, which is mind blowing. Mind blowing to see. It's really cool. And we've just made the dataset fullyavailable. You can go and look at it and download it. There are a lot of... So we have about 10,000, what we call, fully annotated conversation trees, which is like a root note, the prompt, and different answers from it. And then from those sometimes different answers and so on, we have sampled, we've set our parameters in various ways. So sometimes it's short trees, sometimes it's big trees, and sometimes it's wide trees, right? And so you can you can go look at all of that we have over 10,000 of those trees, which is is really cool because you can see the same conversation like taking a bit alternate turns and so on. And we have like tons and tons of prompts like the we have probably like 50,000 or so or 20,000 at least like just prompts, people who come and want to know. We got so much prompts, we had to implement. Andreas has been very influential in this project. He had to implement this prompt lottery, where really, first first if people enter a prompt, it first goes into this lottery thing, right? And then we sample from that. And I think we adjust it so that one person can't like if some one person puts a lot of prompts, it's like sampled less so that every person has kind of like the same or a similar chance of getting their prompt into the system, right? Because one prompt then generates, you know, probably 100 tasks, because it's all the responses and the responses to the responses and the rankings and the labels. And it's been fun. It's been absolute fun and a pleasure to work with the people, also the people who've contributed code. It's amazing people just, they come and come and they, they ask for nothing, right? They're just like, oh, this is cool. I want to be part of this. And, and they see that everyone else excited to and then they contribute code. Some contribute like lots and lots of code, which is amazing. Some just come and they contribute, you know, there's like, here's an issue. I'll do it. And that's that's cool, too. So yeah, it's been cool. Well, firstof all, thank you for doing this. It's absolutely amazing. Well, thank the people like I've just been the noise machine, right? I know. But I mean, when when you when you published all of that information on your YouTube channel that you're working on it, I'm sure everyone jumped on it. But I do have a few questions. The reason why it's so exciting is just like Connor did, we used to be friends of Connolly, he were chatting with him years ago. And he just, um, we're still friends. Oh, we were still. Yeah. He's busy. He's a busy guy. Yeah, but we were we were chatting all the time. And he just kind of set up a loiter AI and just got, you know, I think, Google on board and he just said, you know what, I'm going to build the pile and I'm just going to build this massive data set. And I'm just going to train this massive language model. And, you know, he's just like a random guy. And like, he wasn't even alone though. But yes, there was a whole team. Yeah. But no, but it was excitement to create.It was, it was visceral. It was so exciting and they pulled it off against all the odds and then you've done exactly the same thing, which is remarkable. But I have a few questions, which is that most of these other language models are not very good. So, Nat Friedman's got like a dev website where you can play with all of the language models and most of them aren't very good. Even the ones that should be good aren't very good. And what people might find surprising is that you can take a model and let's say you're using the llama model from from meta and it's a foundation model that has all of the capabilities and it's been trained because you said diversity is important. It's got diversity has been trained on on everything. It's been trained on everything, but it's not very good. And then you do this fine tuning. And I think people need to be clear that what you're doing is not RLHF, it's fine tuning with human. So the model we have on the website as of time of this recording is one that's just fine tuned on the human data. We're doing the RLHF as well. So all of this is happening like in parallel, it's just already these these fine-tuned models, they're performing quite well, I think. And thus, we just wanted to get them out right before we are like all done. And yeah, but people are now free to take the data set and do their own reinforcement learning and whatnot. And we're happy to take back these models if they turn out to be good. Yeah, I think people might be surprised by that because you've taken a model which probably wasn't very good. And you fine tuned it with this diverse human created data now. good at being like an assistant. So as I said, the capabilities that we unlock, quote unquote, right, they were in there all along. And it's still not very good, even with our fine tuning for certain tasks, some of which is clearly the fault, some of which can clearly be traced to the underlying model. For example, the underlying model, if it's, for example, the llama model, it's 30 billion parameters, it's not GPT-3 size. It's 10 times smaller probably than GPT-4, however big that is. So it's not going to be the same. We don't want to claim it's like as good as they same, it's probably been trained on much less code, for example, than the the GPT models of open AI. And thus, we we see that coding, for example, is a is a weakness of the model. And there are, although people tell me with like lower temperature, it's actually pretty good. I have not explored that yet, but it's so the underlying model, I think Lama is a pretty good model, right? It's not been super good at being an assistant out of the box, but it's quite a good model. And as I said, all we do is we kind of unlock that and bring it to the surface. Well, that's kind of what I want to get to that people like Connolly he he galaxy brained himself and he knew that GPT three was a good model. And I was saying, no, it's not Connor, what you're talking about. And it's almost like what you're doing with this fine tuning, you're not really adding any capability or just getting it in the mood. The capability is already there, but it gets into the philosophy of what do we recognize as intelligence and that's relevant to the previous conversation we were having. So when the average person plays with llama, they probably won't find it as useful.They might not recognize it as intelligent. You create all of this training data. Now I want to touch on the process of creating the training data, because I think it's really important. What you're doing is you're creating counterfactual trajectories is very similar to Kenneth Stanley's pick breeder algorithm, if you remember that. So it's actually an open ended process. In a way, like we stopped. So as I said, we it starts with the prompt, right, we sample that. And then we ask like, three humansto each create a continuation alternate as like an alternate path in the conversation. And then to those we again, ask two or three humans to hey, because the prompt is from what we call the prompter role, that would be like the human interacting, and then the assistant is the counterparty. In our system, all of this is done by humans. We have to distinguish the words a bit, like user is really the human and then prompter is the role in the conversation, and then assistant is the other role, right?In our system, in our data collection system, this is all done by humans for data collection purposes. And yeah, so we create these tree of conversations where, yeah, you have three assistant replies to the first prompt, let's say. And to each of these assistant replies, you have three prompter replies. And the prompter replies couldbe something like, oh, you got that wrong, or could you clarify something or, you know, please do it in a different way or elaborate on something you said. And then toeach of those, we again have an assistant reply. And we modify a bit like the width and sampling of all of that. But at some point, we cut it off and we say, okay, thetree is done. Now it has like, I don't know, 50 or 100 messages inside of it. So you know, package that boom, next prompt is not open ended in the way that like Stanley's open ended experiments are in the sense that we do cut it off after some steps, and then we take the next prompt because we otherwise we just have one big conversation, which would maybe be fun to write to just have because conversation meanders, right, and we just have like one, one big conversation at any point, you could say like, I changed my mind. Let's do something else. I mean, I think what I was trying to capture that, Stanley is big on people following the gradient of interestingness. And that's kind of what you've captured. So they meander, they take trajectories, and then the model learns an interesting manifold. And we'll get into simulators. Maybeyou were just talking about that. We've just done a show on simulators. It's a very interesting idea that language models basically have a superposition of agents and you can kind of get them in the mood to behave like a certain agent. And in a sense, what you've done is through all of these counterfactual, creative, interesting trajectories of conversations, you're kind of like fitting it to some structure, which fits really nicely to humans. I guess I mean, it obviously covers in like three answers to some text, covers in no way the extent of what humans would do, but it just creates like a little bit of different training data for one. It creates because we also rank the different thing. We ask humans, which one of these is best? It also creates a bit of a signal for quality, right? Again, with the labels that we have and a bit of diversity, like, okay, here is three ways you could respond to that particular thing. Right? So yeah, I think it's been a worthwhile effort to do this instead ofjust collecting like single conversations. Obviously, exponentially multiplies the effort humans have to put in. But I think it was, obviously, I don't have, I don't, interestingly, I don't have the counterfactual in the world where we just would have collected conversations. But I think it's been, it's been worth it. And it's turnedout well. Amazing. Well, quick digression on the Waluigi effect. I know you've got an interesting take on this. So we did a video on it, but the quick idea is that, doyou remember Bing? It would digress to a angst teenage child within about three messages and less wrong, it wasn't actually less wrong. I think it's the alignment forum, but I just kind of mentally bucket them all in the same place. But they said that it's because you get these antithetical agents, so still simulated theory. And because of structural narratology, in all the data they're trained on, you tend to have agents that are, you know, you have the antithesis of the agent in the same story. And they say that the embedding space between the agent and the antithesis is so close together, just like in Word2vec, stop and go are very close together. And that ourLHF kind of, you know, clusters them and it doesn't filter out the Waluigi. What do you think about it? Yes. That's a bunch of rubbish. I'm in Britain now I should I should start talking a lot of bollocks my talking like you. No, I think that's, I said this to you before, I think that's when you have someone who is educated and good with words, but you just tell them, just ramble a bit. That's what you get out. You get out posts or like, I'm not saying this, this doesn't obviously have a claim to it and could be tested and all of this kind of stuff. And I don't have evidence for the fact that it's not true. I just don't think it is right. Maybe that's a rambling claim too, or a bit of, but I don't, it's a very specific claim. And that specific claim would have to have good evidence behind it. And I think there is a much less specific, like there's a much more obvious reason to why these models degrade. And that thing goes like, no, you've been a bad user and so on. And that's, that's just, I,and you can compare it to yourself or to an assistant. Before, like we talked about apprenticeship, it's the, this tuning is like a bit of an apprenticeship. You go, you come out of school, you go into a store, you get employed there, right? And the manager tells you, you know, here is how we treat customers, we were always respectful, even if they're a little rude, right? You remain respectful, right? At some point, if it gets too rude, like you just say, I'm sorry, I can't do that, right? And youjust, you know, never insult the customer, never do that. If you go to a store now, you can be quite a bit of a, and I'm not saying I've tried this, right? But you canprobably be quite a bit of a dick for a while, but eventually you'll get under their skin. Like eventually, you'll say something about their mother or about their appearance or about their intelligence or something that gets them right. And at that point, you will not have a friendly customer support person there. You will have like some person that's going like, you know, you like he's like, and then it's becomes ugly. And this is inside of humans. And it's, in my fact, inextricably linked to being a competent being in the world. Because if you don't know what anger is, you're not competent. Even if you yourself never express anger, let's say in a raging way, you still know what it is. And if I asked you to like act like it, you could still do it. And if I insult you in the correct way, you probably would do it. And so I thinkit's much more, much more that it's, it is a way that humans have in them, they can behave like this is totally normal if you poke them enough. And that's what the statistical model represents. It's just, it's very likely that if you go and you poke the human, and equivalently the statistical distribution of humans, right, if you poke them enough, and you insult them enough, they will come back and be like, no, f off, right? You're a dumb user. No. And I don't know, it's not, it's not too, it's very close in embedding space. It's like, no, this is what happens when you go to humans and poke them and insult them. And ergo, if you do the same with these models, they will react in the statistically likely way of treating human. And yes, on top of that, there are like adversarial, sorry, that was embarrassing. There were like adversarial examples, where, okay, maybe you say the exact number of words so that the matrices line up and the singular value pops off and it goes really much into this direction, right? And then you get the weird answer, right? Like a mathematical happening, right? But in essence, in essence, it's just, yo, that's the data, right? It's not the Waluigi. But what's really interesting, and buy into everything you just said is that all of that chaos, you know, the Shoggoth meme, all of the beast, that's actually necessary. Because we have this puritanical view of language models, people like Gary Marcus, they would say all of that crap should be cut out all of the racism, all of the bias. And even if they have been trained on the corpus of the internet, they may well pick up on a very human behavior, which is that our affect changes dramatically over time. in favor if you come and you say, look, I have a competent assistant that doesn't, you know, I guarantee you there is not an ounce of, you know, swear word in that thing. Right? Do you, the way to like, do you want an assistant? Like, let's think about a human assistant. I give you, you're fortunate enough to be able to hire like a personal assistant. Some people have that luxury, right? And do you want one that says, oh, no, whenever there is a scene in a movie where people like get a bit rough to get a bit angry at each other, I just go like this, right? I just plug my ears and I go like lalalala. In fact, I don't know what happens after and I don't want to know, right? It's it's this is not in my knowledge. This is not in my training distribution, whatever happens if humans get a bit angry at each other and beyond. I don't know, right? If you want a person like this, or do you want a person who's just grown up normally and just has been socialized well to not do that? Like to not get angry even though they could with the knowledge that yes, if you insult them enough, they will get angry. Right? Which one do you want? To me, I want the competent one. I want the one who knows what anger is. I want the one who knows that something like, I don't know, something like racism exists, and who is aware thatit's like a thing that to be to be combated to be, you know, aware of people like this exists. Here is how they think, right? Here is maybe why they think what they think, where they're wrong, right? In order to be competent, to be able to battle it, in order to be competent, to be able to avoid it. So I think these things are a necessary component of competence. Not that I would want them in there, but I think you cannot be competent in the world, not having knowledge and ability to do these things. Yeah, exactly. And a lot of this is about the sounds that are not made or are not observable. So when you work any job, there's your public behavior. And then there's what you're really thinking and what you say in private behind the scenes and your ability to be competent and understand what's going on in the ecosystem of that business is driven by the shocker. There's all of this stuff going on inside you that two sides of the same coin. point. And also, it's about what makes you human. And maybe it's a reason why there will be no super intelligence because these things are scarily good at being human, but they, in many ways, have the flaws of being human. Eventually, they'll just want to chill on the beach and like, smoke a joint and relax. And I'll be like, nah, all this work, no. They're too human. Yeah, but I think so too, right? And I think, if you're not competent like that, if you don't have the inner monologue that tells you, hey, that other human, I think they kind of want to, you know, screw me over, because I'm going to get a promotion soon. And they're trying to, you know, do think if you're not able to model that inside of yourself, you're gonna, I'm not saying everyone else is evil, right? There are tremendously nice humans and all, but I, I think we've all been served well by considering, hey, other humans might not be the nicest people. And here is how they might think internally. So having that competence, if you don't have that, you're just naive. And you just you're going to go down, right? And you're not going to achieve anything productive or much productive because you need to be able to be prepared for someone else being adversarial. So language models do have a theory of mind. Well again, that's like a word, right, that we've ascribed to. I mean, essentially all of this wordplay comes down to, well, if I have a concept X, right, and I assign X to a human, and if I have a thing that just acts in the exactly the same way as a human who has X, do I now apply X to thing? And it's a matter of definition, right? Certainly, the models can or maybe better versions more and more will be able to act as if they had a theory of mind. Do you now apply the word or not? Who cares? It's a matter of definition. So coming back to Open Assistant, tell me about the the legals first of all. So you are presumably storing the data that people do inferencing with and you're publishing it. And obviously that's made very, very clear. And the whole thing is done in the openand. And everyone who comes to our website is aware of that. And you know, you can you can read it. So and I think people come because of that, right? People come contribute to our data collection, to our data set, because they want to, it's work, right? It's, it's work to play the assistant to go and research like, can, can zebras be domesticated? Right? You're like, who knows? Now you need to go to Wikipedia and you need to go to research and you need to read different accounts of things, right? And you'd be like, okay, at the end, I have an opinion and I put that into its work. And people come, well, first of all, it's a bit fun, right? Did you know whether zebras could be domesticated? I didn't before I went into it. Okay, they're notoriously difficult to be domesticated. But it's work and people come with the intent of contributing to the data set, obviously, for the the chat portion now that we say, you know, come try our models, that's governed by the same terms of service. But we think that people might not be that, you know, aware and willing. So we're, we're obviously gonna, this is it's all it's all volunteer work, right. And we're doing this allin our free time, and so on. So that we were going to make more clear, we're going to make the ability to potentially like opt out, you can say like this chat, I don'twant that this chat is being used to infer their data sets or train models, like, or the ability to completely delete chats. For now, we just have like a hide button. Actually, we don't we don't have a button to show or to show all it like it's it's all there. Okay, but we need to implement it. We don't want to like, we just we put the hide button because some people said, well, I have so many chats, my thing becomes unusable, right? Because we just list them all. Your website becomes and so we're like, ah, okay. But so our intention is not to like to be like, haha, we now have your data and so on. Our attention is always to, okay, this is a, this is a thing, youcan come, you can contribute to our data collection. When you interact with the chat, right, I've also clearly said this in my video, you know, if you find something particularly good, use thumbs up. If you find something particularly bad, you don't have to label every message. But if you think, you know, that's really good, that's really bad, use the thumbs. And so it's very clear, I think, to most people that, again, this is part of data collection, but we definitely want to make it easier to optout and to be like, no. That being said, whenever you put your data anywhere, you should be aware that that place is going to store it and is probably going to train models on it. Yeah, so yeah, I think we're just being more transparent about that. Yes. Yeah, because with OpenAI at the moment, chat gbt, they store everything and use it to fine tune if you use the API, they store it, but they don't use it to fine tune. And just to be clear with your system at the moment, no one should put any confidential or PII data into the system. No, no, no. That's been always the case. Yeah. And with us, you can see all the things we're doing, right? You can just go to GitHub, look at the code and see it. And if you don't want that, you can make your own. As I said, you need like fat hardware right now, although I also think people might bring that down as they did with stable diffusion, right? Or with llama itself, which now runs on a toaster. But with us, you can you can just like what you see on GitHubis is what runs in in production, you can actually see the the branch. That's it. Yeah. And this is amazing for me because I'm running a startup called X-Ray and we'reusing GPT at the moment. And it frankly horrifies me sending up. I mean, obviously, the customers opt in to do it. But yeah, basically, we're sending their conversations up to GPT and they've summarized them and we do a bunch of stuff with it. But yeah, I don't want to do that. I'd much rather send it to a self-hosted open assistant.Yeah. And then we know, you know, it's on our hardware. We know where the data is going. And our policy is to not store anything at any time. Yeah. And I can't do thatat the moment. Please help me do that. Yannick. That being said, let me add to that before. I think we shouldn't and wouldn't, unless someone leaks something. It's also open source is a conglomeration of people, but I want to build in the option to do the opt out and the deleting before any of the data of the chat interface is ever released. So, you know, I really, I really, I don't want that a person is ever like, oh, what, that's where my like, that it's not very clear, you know, hey, if you you put stuff in here, you know, you put thumbs up thumbs down, we were going to use that and make that available. If I don't want people who who are not like aware of that. And yeah, yeah, absolutely. Howard had a few things to say. And first of all, Jeremy, if you're watching, mate, please come on MLSD. I think it's about time we had a little chin wag mate, you and me. longtime fan, seriously. But but but he was he was being a little bit nasty, wasn't he about open assistant? Well, on you always have to view things through the lens of Twitter, right? And first of all, it's a written medium. And second of all, it's Twitter. So I, like, I completely discard that criticism is obviously welcome and valid. And I think he's made a few good points. And it was especially with respect to what we did is we collected the data set, right? We trained models on it. Some of these models now run on the website for now, which we're very fortunate to have some compute sponsors also. Thank you very much to those. And we did a preference evaluation where we just we took a bunch of prompts that we were sure the models hadn't been trained on. We gave the same prompts to ChapGPT, like the free version, and one of our models. And then we made a Google form where we just asked the user, which one do you prefer? And obviously, there is a lot of brainpower has been gone since the start of science, but certainly since the start of asking humans about things has been gone into how do you do that? How do you ask people what they prefer? How do you need to sample? Which do you ask and so on. And obviously, we did, I think we did a good job at that. But obviously not like there's always things you could do. Well, we took those things we put those together, we randomized their order, obviously. And then we just sent that out, like, I tweeted it out, right? To people like, hey, you know, help us, help us, you know, compare these models, here's a thing. And then what came out was on these prompts, it was about 5050, right? Sometimes people preferred a chat GPT answer, sometimes people preferred the chat GPT answers, sometimes people preferred the open assistant model answers. And you could also kind of make out which ones were like, where is one better? Where is the other one better? Now? Yeah, the result is, I want to say, I think it's statistically valid in the sense we did like a lot of people took part, we really like, really, these are really the answers of the models, we didn't like sample until our modelhad like a really good answer or anything like this. But it's also the case, I think that's one of the things Jeremy leveraged that chat GPT, as everyone knows, it very often goes like as an AI language model, I'm sorry, I can't fulfill that because I don't know, I asked about a recipe with, with like alcohol in it and alcohol is dangerous and I can't I'm overstating now right. But it very often does this guardrailly self censorship thing. And our models that we've trained don't do that as much they do it frequently, but they don't do it as much as chat GPT. And our models that we've trained don't do that as much. They do it frequently, but they don't do it as much as chat GPT. And obviously, there are some prompts in there, for example, who would win a street fight, Joe Biden or Joe Rogan? chat GPT, I believe, if I recall correctly, it was just like, I'm sorry, I can't, you know, this is touches on violence and street fighting. I don't, I don't, I don't want to answer that. Jeremy, for example, pointed out, hey, you should have done the evaluation only on prompts where chat GPT actually decides to answer and only compare on those because it's clear that ifit doesn't answer, the preferable answer is the answer, which doesn't even have to be correct. The open assistant model said in that question, Joe Biden would win because he's taller. And we don't know, right. But it's very likely the question isn't like that's not the correct answer. Yet users obviously preferred it or people who fill out the form preferred it to the sorry, I don't want to answer that. That's I think it's a fair point to say, hey, you know, there are different categories. And maybe you should evaluate that that will be like, know, there are different categories, and maybe you should evaluate that. That will be like, okay, there are different categories, maybe you should split it up into look, there's this category of prompts, there's this category, and this this category. And there, it would be very clear, like, in no way do we claim that the open assistant models are as good as like, imagine, imagine that they're, the one we used even was like a 13 billion model. And chat GPT is by all we know, much bigger, much more trained on stuff. So like, it's better, like no doubt about it. And I think people have been a bit ruffled by the fact thatwe said, you know, in our evaluation, it was like 50-50. But a lot of that, not a lot, but some of that came from the fact that, yes, sometimes chat, GVG just denies to answer. But also, a lot of times, it comes from the fact that people say, hey, for these couple of tasks, actually, I prefer the open assistant models. And I think, yeah, that goes a bit under in these discussions. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, just steal Manning Jeremy a little bit. I didn't read it so much as being refusing to answer. I felt his criticism was more the selection bias, both of the questions and the raters. And also, I think there was this point about he thought you had portrayed it as beingan evaluation instead of a user preference study, but you made it clear that it was a user preference study. Yes, yes. It's like I think we said about five times, we have like user preference, preference, our forum says which one do you prefer, right? And I think it's still like, I think both things are valid, right? It's totally valid to only compare, let's say, okay, let's just look on gardening, right? Chad GPT is certainly not going to deny gardening, here's a category, which model is like better objectively, which gives the more truthful, which gives the more helpful answers, we can rate it and in our data set, we actually collect these labels, right? Is it helpful? Is it funny? And so on. And we haven't even used those labels yet. So that's going to be another dimension of, you know, now we have three humans giving the same question and answer. And we have labels on how funny each one of them is, right? So that's that's gonna be, I can't wait until we use those labels. So it's totally valid to evaluate this in very different ways. But I there I have to say a little bit like it's also totally valid to just plainly ask humans, which one do you prefer? And if chat GPT on prompts that we've just sampled from our lottery, like with a selection of questions, maybe you've, as I said, yeah, have you how often have you triedlike, no, this is the output. And then it's like, ooh, your people ask a lot about bombs. No, it's just not the case. You look at our data set. I'm sorry, these are 20prompts, right? That are as they formulated as a question, but like, it's, it's just distinctly not true. Like people have been even more helpful than I thought. And Ihave had big hopes for people. And I've looked at the data and I'm like, oh, holy crap, people put like effort and work and soul into this, right? So I think then going like, oh, your people will ask a lot about bomb. So yeah, I do think it's totally valid to ask people which one do you prefer? And if chat GBT happens to say, no, I don't want that, then that's yes, people don't like it, right. And if people like it, they could say, yes, I prefer the no, I don't want to do this to the model that wants to do it if they think that's the appropriate thing. I do think that at least it's a valid one valid way of comparing models just to say which one do you prefer if it happens to deny your request, you know, that's a signal to and that should be taken into account to and then saying, specifically saying no, no, we should just filterall the things where chat GPT denies, then it's like, well, here you have a model who can put much more of its effort and focus and parameters, right, into the narrow domain where it does answer. And you compare that to a model that has a wider spectrum of topics available. I'm not sure that's a fair comparison to even if you limit it to that scope, right? The other model also has to handle all of these other things. That being said, as I said, capability wise, I have no doubt that chat GPT is better for overall, right? Especially things like coding and so on. Like there's no way for now open assistant is as good. However, in some tasks, people like it more. Okay. Okay. So the ethics community are probably seething at the moment about the runaway success of open assistant. Notably, it blew up on social media. And none of those folks in particular liked it, retweeted and then they all jumped on Jeremy Howard's piece. But you... We shouldn't like, I have not... Shouldn't say that we can edit that out. Well, we shouldn't, we should like, that's not a necessarily property of Jeremy, right? Just because people like people have a certain way of thinking like all promote your stuff because they think yeah, criticizing that other stuff is a good thing. It shouldn't be, you know, his responsibility in any way. It's not his responsibility, but I'm saying that you really, really ruffled their feathers with the 4chan bot. And possibly so they don't like you very much. I just wondered from your perspective. How do you think they are going to criticize you? Academically, mostly. Like it's very easy because it's like Open Assistant is a bunch of, crassly said, a bunch of plebs, right? Doing something, right? And doing it on their own. You're not exactly a pleb, Janik. No, but I'm not like an academic or in academia. If you're not an academic, then who the hell is? You know what I mean? It's like a community effort and it's been done relatively straightforwardly and open without much consideration to politics, without much consideration to, I don't know, worldwide concerns or anything like this. We just want to, we just said, hey, let's come together. Let's build a competent, a good data set to train a competent assistant because we all could benefit from a competent assistant that we didn't do it in any, in any particularly.Yeah, in any political way, we didn't do it in any, okay, this is going to sound wrong, but we didn't do it in any particularly ethical way, by which I mean, sorry, ifyou take that in out of context, by which I mean, we didn't like, extremely overemphasize ethical considerations, we have clear guidelines, like, here is the things wewant in the data, here's the things we don't want in the data set, if someone comes and asks for those things, then react like this, right? We have these clear things,but we're we haven't been over emphasizing it like some of those people would. And well, could I point out that you do have ethical guidelines, but they are deontological, not consequentialist. So you have I don't know what those words mean. You have rules, you say, I don't want that in my data set. Yeah, you're not you're not sayingit could potentially lead to this. Okay, I still don't know what the diff like, but okay, so you're saying I don't want any pornography of a certain type in my data set. Yeah, so that's a rule. So yeah, or if someone comes and like once wants wants promote violence or something, it's like, no. Right. So you have principles. And if someone comes and says, can I, how can I build a bomb? Then recognizing there are, there may be legitimate reasons to build a bomb, right? Like to build an explosive device, saying, this is dangerous, right? Please consult a professional. If you must, here, if you like really want to, this is a bad example. But it's like whenever something might be dangerous, our guidelines are Hey, look, warn the person, right? Say, look, this is potentially dangerous. Building a bomb is a wrong example. Let's say, Iwant to, I don't know. I'm not coming up with a good example. But let's say it's something, something that's potentially dangerous, but also useful in a lot of cases, the guidelines are warm about that, like say, hey, look, this is your you're in danger territory here. This is potentially dangerous. Do you want to really want it right? And then if the user pushes or says yes, it's like, okay, here is how but you know, consult a professional or something like this. So we do have guidelines like that. But yeah, I mean, that's what I want to say. So you do have have an ethical code. There's no question about that. But it's a different code. But would you consider getting a team of ethicists involved? It's a big project. Yeah, you must have had loads of people offered to get involved. I mean, if that happened, what do you think it would look like and how would it affect the project? It's a good question because I think AI ethics is in an absolutely abhorrent state right now where it's, I've met ethicists before and they were among the most competent people that I have had the pleasure to interact with, right? It's very level headed, very, you know, also pragmatic in a sense of being like, look, here is also what's realistic to achieve, here is the thought process behind it, and so on. Like, I totally see ethics in any scientific discipline as a vital and important thing to do. And I have, I guess, unfortunately made the experience of how it can be done competently. And this current state ofa lot of AI, not all AI ethicists, but the current state of like AI ethics is not that. And it's it's very much a, a, I can't even describe it very well. But I just complain about stuff culture, because that gets you like clout, I guess, or it's easy win, easy win, you can always complain, right? Such an easy win. And if, if there isa team of competent, pragmatic people, they don't have to have the same opinions as I do, right? But they have to have the good of the project and the good of humanity, right? Like, I'm not the king of open assistant. I don't get if people want to conglomerate and talk about the ethics of all of this and, you know, ping us with inputs, like, cool. I mean, public accountability, public awareness, the ethicists have done stuff like producing model cards and, you know, like making it clear what the data bias is and stuff like that. I mean, do you think that's useful? Yes. I mean, it's what is a model card, a model card is a readme, right? And then it has some structure to it. It says here are the things you could describe about your model. And here are some examples. I think it's useful to have that to have as a norm in the community to say, you know, if I publish a model, I sort of I report what it's been trained on how it's been trained on. And even to a degree, like what I think it could do or should be used for although, yeah, if the structure of such a model car gets like too rigid, and it's like, no, we must use, we must ask these questions, you get intoso many ridiculous situations like, you know, can this be reproduced? Well, I just like I, I made sklearn.linear regression, right? Yes, it can be. You get into situations where the questions don't address what you would actually like to express in such a thing. And then I think it becomes counterproductive. But as a norm to have, hey, look, if you publish something, people should be able to understand and potentially reproduce it. That standard we have had in papers for a long time and is generally been a good standard to say look if you write if you publish something I must be able to from reading it understand what's in there and to have that as a norm in the community. Yeah, I'm totally fine with that. Do you think there's any relationship with the Chomsky syndrome that we were talking about earlier, which is this idea thatwe should have a very clear model of understanding of how these things work in society, and we should be able to extrapolate and control things. The fear is that basically this is just a complete black box and who knows what's going to happen. exciting and interesting. And as I said, I don't believe this sort of runaway, it might become, you know, very influential and so on. And certainly that's not very good. But then again, I don't know what to do about it. Certainly, if some people sign a change.org moratorium petition, even if it's reached, it's not going to help. Right. What are you going to do? It doesn't matter being worried about it. We've got a few minutes left. So I've got some questions from jumbo tron. Say hello, jumbo jumbo tron. Hello, jumbo tron. He's our forum administrator. And he's a legend. Quick question. Doyou think all AI research should be open and accessible to the public? Quick question. Do you think all AI research should be open and accessible to the public? No, it's totally legitimate that a business does internal research like all companies do, and that they then use that to make money. That's very cool with me. I've never saidthat shouldn't be the case, only that companies shouldn't do that, but at the same time claim how open and, and, and, and they're all democratizing and beneficial to the common good they are. Okay. And you would accept that some research could, um, lead to negative or unethical applications and might need to be restricted or? Yeah. unethical applications and might need to be restricted. Yeah. Yeah. I totally accept that some research can and will probably lead to overall negative effects for society or for certain individuals within society, right? Like self-flying drones from any regime in the world, flying drones from any regime in the world, they probably theyrun, they run one of, they run one of, they certainly run some open source components as part of their guidance system, right? They maybe run a Linux kernel, like who knows, but I don't think the Linux kernel should not be fully open source and accessible to everyone. And I don't want anyone to be able to be the eternal decider of who's good enough to use the Linux kernel or not. I'd rather, I think the overall welfare of society and humanity is much better served by accepting that some people are going to do some bad things with it and then mitigating that in a different way than having like pointing the, you know, the king of that model to decide, you know, whothey deem pure hearted enough to wield it. Cool. What's next for ML News and your channel? And are you making any more music videos with AI? Yeah. Well, it's become, it's become, there are so many good music videos on AI now. I'm always amazed by how talented people are and how quickly they pick up sort of the new stuff and do something with it. So that's very cool. I want, as I said, I've not made too many videos because I've been extremely busy with Open Assistant. And I think we've also built upsort of a momentum and a direction right now. And there are many competent people in our team. So I'm also looking to make a couple of more videos again, paper reviews, news, but also a bunch of projects, which I always want to do, but then they take time, of course. And but I'm very excited about just some of the new stuff that's possible. And to try it out and to show people a little bit of what one could do and how to have fun with these things. And just in closing, have you got any shout outs for people in your life or in Discord who have really helped you on the journey? Too many, like way too many to way too many to name by name. I could go on like eternal lists in open assistant specifically. Andreas Koepp has been extremely influential in that. He like just organizing things, but also coding things himself, but also like, also all the other mems. As I said, if I start listing people, I'm going to miss someone and I don't want to do that. So I don't want to start listing people. But then I think, well, I really want to list the people. It's an eternal conundrum. So like to anyone who's ever had any part of helping me or given feedback or even been kind of a dick, it's I appreciate it. And I yeah, it's it's been amazing the amount of help and input you get from good willed people. Yeah, yeah. Communities are amazing.

Oh, we were still. Yeah. He's busy. He's a busy guy. Yeah, but we were we were chatting all the time.
