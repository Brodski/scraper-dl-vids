[0.00s -> 5.36s]  We want to take a moment to pay tribute to Barbara Walters. She was a trailblazing journalist
[5.36s -> 10.16s]  who spent more than half a century in broadcast news. Throughout her iconic career, Barbara
[10.16s -> 15.20s]  Walters shattered glass ceiling after glass ceiling, breaking barriers in an industry once dominated
[15.20s -> 20.08s]  by men, and paving the way for today's female journalists. She was the first-ever woman
[20.08s -> 25.92s]  to co-host NBC's Today Show, and later the first woman to anchor a network evening news
[26.00s -> 29.60s]  broadcast. In a tweet on Saturday, President Biden said, quote,
[29.60s -> 34.48s]  Barbara Walters has always been an example of bravery and truth, breaking barriers,
[34.48s -> 40.48s]  while driving our nation forward. Her legacy will continue as an inspiration for all journalists.
[40.48s -> 45.84s]  Barbara Walters conducted hundreds of interviews with newsmakers from the world of politics,
[45.84s -> 50.32s]  sports, and entertainment. She was famous for asking tough questions and sometimes
[50.32s -> 54.72s]  uncomfortable questions, and forgetting some of the world's most famous people to reveal
[54.72s -> 59.36s]  parts of themselves the public had not seen before. Here she was on Meet the Press back in
[59.36s -> 64.32s]  February 1976, pressing then the Prime Minister of Israel.
[65.52s -> 68.96s]  We'll have the first questions now from Barbara Walters of NBC News.
[68.96s -> 73.92s]  Mr. Prime Minister, you have repeatedly said in your speeches that a militarily strong
[73.92s -> 78.48s]  Israel is necessary to maintain the peace. Now, the Pentagon and the CIA have reported
[78.48s -> 82.80s]  after their military analysis that Israel is more than strong enough to deter any
[82.80s -> 87.52s]  Arab aggression. Were you able to convince Congress and President Ford, those who are
[87.52s -> 93.36s]  responsible for deciding military aid to Israel, that you are right and that the CIA and the Pentagon
[93.36s -> 99.04s]  are wrong? Well, first I would like to thank the CIA and the Pentagon for complimenting
[99.68s -> 107.36s]  Israel for its military strengths. But I believe that we need more than compliments.
[107.36s -> 111.28s]  We need hard work. Mr. Prime Minister, we've heard these arguments now back and forth for
[111.28s -> 116.48s]  a year. And I'd like to get back to my very first question, which was how do you expect to have a
[116.48s -> 122.56s]  Geneva conference reconvened without the PLO? Can you give us any sign, any hope, any direction?
[122.56s -> 128.48s]  Can you realistically be specific about one new action that's going to break the stalemate,
[128.48s -> 132.96s]  the same conversation back and forth that we have heard from the year? Has anything happened
[132.96s -> 136.16s]  in this week or are things basically the way they were before you came to this country?
[136.72s -> 141.60s]  I believe that there are basically two options, how to move towards peace.
[144.32s -> 150.80s]  Incredible to watch her do her work. Barbara Walters died on Friday in New York City. She was 93 years old.
[166.16s -> 167.62s]  you
