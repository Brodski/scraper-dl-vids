[190.19s -> 195.62s]  Yeah, that guy has
[195.78s -> 196.98s]  GP
[196.98s -> 215.50s]  bees
[215.50s -> 216.90s]  Jesus
[216.90s -> 256.05s]  Yo, I was a man
[256.09s -> 318.94s]  What's up, dudes?
[318.94s -> 327.09s]  Yeah, I mean we're hoping we'll see man. We'll see
[330.25s -> 390.91s]  Fingers fucking crossed, right? Do I ever actually?
[392.15s -> 462.88s]  I'm wondering if I I'm assuming I'm just playing a math. No way. Yay
[463.66s -> 484.12s]  Yeah, this is probably just me doing fucking I'm probably just doing Star Guardian
[498.34s -> 502.54s]  Welcome to the 27 months, man. You're wrong
[503.54s -> 530.98s]  Appreciate it a lot, dude. Thank you, and I could probably still go infinite team, but so I'm holding the solution
[531.72s -> 533.72s]  But I haven't seen any servers or anything
[534.78s -> 619.93s]  So I'd be kind of awkward, you know, this guy's definitely gonna beat me that guy's I
[621.01s -> 625.21s]  See why he hasn't lost that's his five infinity team already. Jesus Christ. I
[626.29s -> 628.97s]  Was like man, why is that guy so strong and then I like realized?
[629.55s -> 780.82s]  So I go to seven next rounds and then hopefully we can hit
[782.14s -> 806.36s]  Some shit. I kind of like this actually because now we can make I
[807.60s -> 809.28s]  can actually make a
[809.28s -> 811.28s]  Guard breaker and I can also make
[811.76s -> 848.96s]  We go like guard breaker ms. I kind of want to just ionic spark, but I don't know if I should I need
[850.36s -> 852.36s]  an echo a
[852.40s -> 854.40s]  Nico or a round
[854.40s -> 857.40s]  I also could use an Ezreal. I need like a quick draw.
[858.40s -> 876.02s]  I should have kept that Lucian from earlier.
[876.02s -> 880.02s]  This guy has a level 3 Blitzcrank and he's just so fucking strong it's stupid.
[880.02s -> 950.92s]  This is really interesting.
[950.92s -> 975.23s]  I guess I could go Spellslinger as well.
[975.23s -> 978.23s]  And we can just give the Shiv to TF.
[978.23s -> 1007.98s]  We can just do this for now too.
[1007.98s -> 1037.21s]  I guess I could use...
[1037.21s -> 1042.18s]  I could do Jeweled Gauntlet.
[1042.18s -> 1044.50s]  I don't know.
[1044.50s -> 1048.51s]  Could Jeweled Gauntlet this shit up.
[1048.51s -> 1107.41s]  up see how it goes I need to like throw an item down but I feel like Morellos is
[1107.41s -> 1119.64s]  bad I guess I could just use hat or like I said before jeweled gauntlet could be
[1119.64s -> 1152.98s]  good I don't know I could just roll on seven to trying three star stuff this guy
[1152.98s -> 1161.02s]  has three Kaisas though this guy has one Kaisa kind of hard to three star Kaisa I
[1161.02s -> 1190.70s]  I could 3-star Nyla.
[1190.70s -> 1193.70s]  They got an 8 with fucking 20 gold?
[1194.70s -> 1196.70s]  Here he has MF.
[1197.70s -> 1198.70s]  And...
[1198.70s -> 1354.04s]  Dude, Blitzcrank's insane.
[1354.04s -> 1357.04s]  Dude, that Gnar just merked me.
[1357.04s -> 1360.04s]  I did not position for the Gnar, and I got...
[1360.04s -> 1371.22s]  ...fucked for it.
[1371.22s -> 1372.22s]  This motherfucker.
[1372.22s -> 1400.82s]  Dude, I wish I could get some...
[1400.82s -> 1403.82s]  ...thick frontline leveled up.
[1403.82s -> 1404.82s]  That'd be cool.
[1424.71s -> 1543.83s]  Oh my god another Gnar, well RIP.
[1543.83s -> 1548.23s]  I was going to go MF and then I decided to go Neeko and then I just fucked it all up.
[1548.23s -> 1551.25s]  Oh well.
[1551.25s -> 1571.42s]  Oh well.
[1571.42s -> 1595.82s]  What time is it, 10?
[1595.82s -> 1596.82s]  Okay.
[1596.82s -> 1597.82s]  Oh.
[1597.82s -> 1598.82s]  What's up boys?
[1598.82s -> 1599.82s]  How's everybody doing?
[1599.82s -> 1613.21s]  Oh I'll be right back.
[1613.21s -> 1614.21s]  Sorry I'm still waking up.
[1614.21s -> 1615.21s]  Let me.
[1615.21s -> 1644.14s]  what's up boys how's everybody doing oh I'll be right back so I'm still waking up
[1644.14s -> 1681.76s]  let me give me one sec what's up Skye oh okay oh yeah baby I was gonna play on my
[1681.76s -> 1684.92s]  main at the start but dude I don't know if I can sit through fucking eight
[1684.92s -> 1688.88s]  minute cue times to get people raging at each other all day so we'll uh we'll do
[1688.88s -> 1714.18s]  warm up on this account for a bit. What are Mars's count? Like D1 low master. Like my other account's
[1714.18s -> 1721.14s]  like 500. This one's I want to say like I don't know the MMR is really awkward uh when you get
[1721.14s -> 1725.38s]  like low masters right like the MMR is super awkward so I don't know what the MMR is but I
[1725.38s -> 1729.78s]  know it's low masters so like sometimes there's diamonds sometimes there's like 100 LP players
[1729.78s -> 1743.60s]  somewhere between there dude I I played some games off stream yesterday I got up
[1743.60s -> 1757.34s]  to like 400 LP then I lost three in a row that shit was painful I did int one
[1757.34s -> 1771.22s]  of tenacity's games though so that was fun that felt bad no yeah straight up it
[1771.22s -> 1775.34s]  felt so bad he was doing so good too like I straight up just had a bad game
[1775.34s -> 1781.41s]  and I felt I felt like shit look at this shit I just dropped like eight deaths
[1781.41s -> 1782.05s]  look at the shits
[1785.25s -> 1788.05s]  like he was just straight up smurfing on the enemy top laner
[1788.93s -> 1793.17s]  and we all the entire team just like decided to collectively run it down
[1795.26s -> 1808.85s]  like we all just got shit on this was a really weird game because i feel like uh that game was
[1808.85s -> 1813.57s]  like the first game i felt everybody in the game was like actually high gm challenger but they
[1813.57s -> 1830.50s]  weren't rated that there's a very weird system going on let's do a cassiopeia game like i'll
[1830.50s -> 1845.39s]  show you guys what i mean in a second i'm assuming i should go this right this is probably good
[1846.43s -> 1857.46s]  or this that's probably good too oh well okay so yeah we'll get this stuff
[1858.74s -> 1864.50s]  like nian tanso is like he's been challenger for a long time right i don't even know who the
[1864.50s -> 1874.34s]  fuck this guy was some random senna player who's like not playing senna now and then this guy was
[1874.34s -> 1879.70s]  like trying to jungle and just like running it down it was i don't even know it was the weirdest
[1879.70s -> 1887.70s]  game that i've played in a while because like my ad carry wasn't bad like this guy is clearly like
[1887.70s -> 1893.38s]  on a smurf but i don't know how good he was because he wasn't bad at the game the enemy ad carry
[1893.38s -> 1900.10s]  wasn't bad this guy's also on a smurf it was the weirdest lobby it was like a bunch of smurf
[1900.10s -> 1909.17s]  accounts all playing with each other but it was like a non-smurf queue this guy was like the only
[1909.17s -> 1927.09s]  non-smurf it was interesting oh do i take ghost here or do i just i feel like ghost could be
[1927.09s -> 1939.28s]  really op versus their team with cassiopeia but maybe i should just take i'm gonna try it
[1939.28s -> 1946.68s]  Oh somebody dodged cuz yeah, I don't know. I never know. I never know if I should take ghost ignite, whatever
[1948.50s -> 1954.66s]  Cuz I feel like ghost with Cassio's feels like the same thing as AD carry right same idea where it feels really OP
[1963.32s -> 1974.66s]  Dude, there's so much drama going on in the league community yet again, by the way, like it's it's insane
[1994.54s -> 1996.66s]  Yeah, I don't know man. I I
[1997.86s -> 2001.30s]  Just I'm
[2001.30s -> 2006.70s]  I like I like looking at drama
[2007.30s -> 2008.74s]  Cuz like
[2008.74s -> 2016.64s]  Drama's juicy. Like I like looking at drama, but it's also like how are people so stupid?
[2033.54s -> 2035.54s]  yeah, I'm getting like I I
[2036.22s -> 2045.10s]  Don't know man. My view on all of this shit is like I I guess I'm just not hardwired that way. I can't
[2045.62s -> 2049.38s]  Mentally wrap my head around being like excited to flirt with underage girls
[2049.94s -> 2063.01s]  Or like when like I I just I I've never like had the want like it happens so much
[2063.31s -> 2068.51s]  between like league streamers and non like just it's not even a league thing it's just that we're
[2068.51s -> 2075.87s]  in the league community right so you see it more dude like well the the drama is like uh a decent
[2075.87s -> 2080.11s]  size league streamer who was like getting bigger or whatever like the ad carry streamer cookie
[2080.11s -> 2093.12s]  lol or whatever he was like somebody made a 90 page 90 pages of google doc to basically like
[2093.12s -> 2099.92s]  expose this guy for like talking a bunch like sexually to underage girls not paying his fucking
[2099.92s -> 2117.28s]  like mods who do work for him and like other stuff and i'm like dude how man like just be a
[2117.28s -> 2125.44s]  normal human it's not that bad like i take it from me being a normal dude it's not that bad
[2200.45s -> 2206.69s]  sorry i was distracted no uh yeah i don't know man i i swear to god people are just stupid as
[2206.69s -> 2213.11s]  fuck people are idiots there's got to be some psychological underlying issue with
[2213.11s -> 2215.91s]  people's brains not working but it is what it is
[2215.91s -> 2234.18s]  huh I've had this barcode account for a while dude what is that Tarek skin you
[2234.18s -> 2238.02s]  see this look at this Tarek skin man he's fabulous
[2238.02s -> 2259.02s]  god damn my man's just straight-up fabulous people are desperate I just
[2259.02s -> 2262.38s]  can't like I don't think like I've been in the situation where I was like a
[2262.38s -> 2268.50s]  really really big streamer like much bigger than he is and I got like I this
[2268.50s -> 2274.18s]  is what I'm saying is like I understand like all of the crap that gets thrown at
[2274.18s -> 2278.66s]  you like people will literally message you for no reason like you do have like
[2278.66s -> 2283.22s]  like fans that have like when I was at my biggest point like you have fans that are
[2283.22s -> 2288.82s]  younger girls guy it doesn't matter and like you just gotta like I just never in my mind
[2288.82s -> 2293.38s]  I guess thought like oh I'm gonna flirt with these people like it made me like I don't
[2293.38s -> 2303.17s]  even I wouldn't even I literally didn't even see them as like sexual in my brain like it
[2303.17s -> 2310.68s]  blows my mind and then the fact that like if you like if you look at the google doc
[2310.68s -> 2316.76s]  whatever the fact that like taco like i keep a taco whatever it was literally talking to him
[2316.76s -> 2320.12s]  telling him he was doing it like what he was doing was wrong he was like yeah i get it right
[2320.92s -> 2339.02s]  then he did it again dude the set ulting the pussy that i'll be honest that may be one of
[2339.02s -> 2358.02s]  the funniest lines i've ever heard like dude i mean whatever you know i'm not here to kink shame
[2358.02s -> 2362.42s]  Whatever gets people off, you know, maybe maybe maybe that's a fetish. I don't know
[2394.93s -> 2399.68s]  Safe and sounds either way
[2401.08s -> 2404.68s]  Don't worry. We can not talk about the drama real quick. We can talk about
[2406.84s -> 2427.27s]  How old and washed up wings to that is though I'm kidding
[2432.43s -> 2434.91s]  Yo, did you see on a wider note though? Did you see riot?
[2434.91s -> 2439.95s]  there was like a reddit thread or something where riot was saying that they're like gonna
[2439.95s -> 2445.57s]  try and do something about smurfing in the next few months i don't know what that means
[2447.81s -> 2459.97s]  but can you tell us something involving wings just between us yeah yeah just between us and
[2459.97s -> 2463.65s]  all the homies yeah yeah in chat yeah yeah no nobody else said anything it's fine yeah no
[2467.46s -> 2501.66s]  what's up my chat ain't snitches when i was a teen i made a montage of him having breakdowns
[2501.66s -> 2516.30s]  in my games oh my god that's amazing oh my god that's amazing i feel like i need to pay you to
[2516.30s -> 2524.06s]  see this montage like i will give you money like i i need to see this is important to me
[2545.49s -> 2549.65s]  oh i have dude you should see the i i i have so many rage compilations about me it's crazy
[2550.93s -> 2566.99s]  so many i had a i had a villain arc for sure i feel like it just comes with like being a league
[2566.99s -> 2581.90s]  streamer. League players are not all mentally healthy homie. Let me tell ya. Take it from me.
[2589.33s -> 2592.05s]  Ad. Okay, I'd like to think I'm not a villain anymore.
[2593.09s -> 2625.42s]  Fuck you. I really want this plate. Nice. Dude, Anivia's roaming. Why is their Wukong
[2625.42s -> 2637.89s]  just sitting top by the way? That's actually hilarious. You know what's interesting?
[2637.89s -> 2645.90s]  I feel like Taric actually missed that stun. I
[2646.66s -> 2650.22s]  Was kind of side-eyeing that but I feel like he missed that stun somehow. I
[2671.74s -> 2676.30s]  Feel like this is the easiest game I've ever played by the way. I'm on full autopilot
[2676.94s -> 2682.00s]  Brain still waking up and I feel like they're just walking into me on repeat. I'm just killing them off. I
[2682.66s -> 2684.66s]  Don't even know what the fuck's going on
[2685.54s -> 2690.80s]  Like they it feels like the enemy team has not like they didn't they didn't like understand we were playing league
[2690.80s -> 2695.60s]  right like they queued up and they were like oh yeah this is League that's what
[2695.60s -> 2700.08s]  this feels like this is what I imagine if like Mike Tyson went into a preschool
[2700.08s -> 2702.00s]  you know what I mean like this is what this feels like
[2702.00s -> 2747.57s]  I probably could have killed those guys but I don't want to the chill I'm
[2747.57s -> 2755.40s]  assuming the Wukong is gonna come bot soon there he is
[2755.40s -> 2770.93s]  Damn it I cleansed late. I actually killed both. That was a late cleanse by me. My bad.
[2770.93s -> 2777.93s]  I don't want to take the risk of a backup. If she stuns me they can one shot me. I should
[2777.93s -> 2783.89s]  have killed the fucking guy though. The Wukong. I just backed up too far and then I cleansed
[2783.89s -> 2798.80s]  the stun for like really late. Hi Jarrah. Hey what's up man. What's up boys. Good evening.
[2798.80s -> 2815.71s]  evening good morning i don't know where the fuck you guys live so good day what the fuck am i
[2815.71s -> 2841.14s]  watching wait that wukong lived whoa bro oh and i'm dead dude that wall was bs
[2843.38s -> 2846.98s]  there was like a little hole and then i flashed late because i was like oh i could walk out the
[2846.98s -> 2855.74s]  hole but i couldn't walk out the tiny little hole motherfuckers i shouldn't have even been there but
[2855.74s -> 2865.49s]  like i'm stupid i should just push bot i was like dude that's such a bad fight but i walked over to
[2865.49s -> 2870.21s]  it i was like i'm really fed honestly i probably could have killed him if i didn't uh if i like
[2870.21s -> 2881.36s]  flashed the stun annie stuns the only like most over like i swear if if they reduced annie stun
[2881.36s -> 2888.72s]  by like 0.5 seconds she would never get played like actually the only reason to play annie is
[2888.72s -> 2890.72s]  Her stun is just so op
[2890.96s -> 2892.24s]  because it's like a
[2892.24s -> 2896.80s]  It's like the reason they changed taric so long ago where like when you have a point click cc
[2900.58s -> 2902.58s]  It's typically really broken
[2911.30s -> 2913.30s]  Okay, i'm just dead
[2913.86s -> 2915.94s]  Does taric not have alt leveled up at six?
[2921.73s -> 2940.66s]  He didn't level his ulti
[2940.82s -> 2946.93s]  Maybe it's maybe taric ult sucks. Maybe it's underpowered, you know
[2948.93s -> 2959.34s]  No, yeah, he must have misclicked
[2959.34s -> 2962.54s]  Honestly, I'm just briefing. I'm like playing too aggro for like
[2963.82s -> 2966.06s]  Like I I threw my lead because I was like, oh shit
[2966.06s -> 2971.34s]  I'm gonna walk over and help the homies. You never walk over and help the homies when the homies are getting shit on because uh
[2972.62s -> 2977.10s]  if you have like 900 gold or a thousand gold lead like like I did or whatever you don't want to do that just because
[2977.98s -> 2979.18s]  You'll give
[2979.18s -> 2983.52s]  Mf a ton of kills
[2983.60s -> 2994.14s]  We're in a good spot now, though
[2994.30s -> 2996.30s]  But I am still a little
[2996.46s -> 2998.46s]  Wait taric. Oh, we leveled the zoltaners
[2998.46s -> 3006.09s]  this Taric does not know how to play Taric by the way he's thrown out his
[3006.09s -> 3013.29s]  stun so awkwardly that's okay though I mean I apparently don't know how to play
[3013.29s -> 3026.93s]  Draven so can't really blame the guy I mean you guys are doing dragon with no
[3026.93s -> 3045.83s]  smite my team's like doing dragon with no smite I mean we could fight these
[3045.83s -> 3056.77s]  fights but it's like painful we could easily fight these fights I think a lot
[3056.77s -> 3062.29s]  of it is just like, Taric isn't confident enough to walk up and stun, right? Like, that's what I'm
[3062.29s -> 3066.53s]  seeing the issue is. He's doing the thing where like, he's not, he doesn't have the confidence
[3066.53s -> 3074.15s]  to actually walk up since he's a melee champ. So he's walking up and like taking half his health,
[3075.35s -> 3082.95s]  and it's making him nervous. It happens a lot with players who aren't very melee champ centric.
[3084.07s -> 3086.95s]  Because melee supports are actually pretty risky, or they're pretty scary rather.
[3086.95s -> 3099.74s]  Oh, he's totally dead. Oh no, maybe not.
[3099.74s -> 3102.28s]  But yeah, melee supports are scary to play,
[3102.28s -> 3106.22s]  because you have to know when you can get a kill
[3106.22s -> 3108.14s]  by going in, because you're going to take damage, right?
[3108.14s -> 3112.42s]  That's just like the nature of melee supports.
[3112.42s -> 3117.39s]  Nice.
[3117.39s -> 3120.07s]  We're coming back in a bit. Not bad.
[3120.07s -> 3122.83s]  We threw a little bit early, but yeah,
[3122.83s -> 3124.63s]  we're starting to get it back. We're chilling.
[3124.63s -> 3128.18s]  Tarek's a never good.
[3128.18s -> 3131.82s]  I'm always confused by Tarek, because he feels
[3131.82s -> 3135.58s]  like such a good champion like the champion itself feels broken as shit
[3137.66s -> 3140.22s]  like whenever i whenever i see tarik i think to myself like
[3142.22s -> 3152.46s]  he's either unkillably like super op or they're like oh and 10 there's no in between right like
[3152.46s -> 3170.76s]  they either know how to play tarik or they don't is what it feels like oh you i mean yeah you are
[3170.76s -> 3177.72s]  wrong taric actually requires mechanics that's actually true whereas like most supports like
[3177.72s -> 3182.04s]  nautilus doesn't have mechanics you know and like blitzcrank doesn't have mechanics they
[3182.04s -> 3189.64s]  just hit their button and if it if it works they they get a kill whereas like taric after you stun
[3189.64s -> 3212.50s]  there is like stuff you have to do that doesn't make sense or block do you think um oh i'm gonna
[3212.50s -> 3213.34s]  I'm gonna die.
[3215.14s -> 3219.19s]  Oh, thank God.
[3219.19s -> 3221.35s]  Do you think Taric's one of the harder supports?
[3221.35s -> 3225.55s]  I think he's pretty hard.
[3225.55s -> 3226.39s]  Like, I don't think he's,
[3226.39s -> 3228.59s]  well, I mean, he's harder than the other supports.
[3228.59s -> 3229.85s]  Like, I think like,
[3229.85s -> 3233.07s]  I don't think there's a single support that's hard.
[3233.07s -> 3237.05s]  I know, I'm toxic for that, but I stand by it.
[3241.59s -> 3256.40s]  Whoa.
[3256.40s -> 3257.24s]  I mean, I'm just gonna die.
[3257.24s -> 3259.04s]  I'm not gonna try and flash.
[3259.04s -> 3261.80s]  I don't think, I should've just flashed over,
[3261.80s -> 3263.88s]  But I kind of got baited by the Taric ult.
[3263.88s -> 3265.84s]  I wanted to see if I could fight,
[3265.84s -> 3267.04s]  but there's too much CC.
[3268.32s -> 3272.14s]  I was like, oh, he's ulting me, let's go.
[3272.14s -> 3274.40s]  I can tell this is a really low evil game
[3274.40s -> 3275.90s]  because there's so much random deaths.
[3275.90s -> 3279.46s]  Like I'm falling victim to like I'm autopiloting
[3279.46s -> 3280.86s]  and like I'm not thinking,
[3280.86s -> 3282.02s]  and I'm just talking to you guys
[3282.02s -> 3283.58s]  and I'm just dying for free.
[3283.58s -> 3286.46s]  But it's like, there's so many people just dying for free.
[3286.46s -> 3287.90s]  It's hilarious.
[3287.90s -> 3288.74s]  Thresh?
[3288.74s -> 3290.54s]  Thresh isn't actually that farmed.
[3290.54s -> 3296.06s]  So, like, a lot of people think like Thresh mechanically is very difficult because he
[3296.06s -> 3300.26s]  is harder than the other supports, but he's not actually that hard.
[3300.26s -> 3312.77s]  He's like, once you learn the Thresh combos, he's pretty much a very upfront champion.
[3312.77s -> 3321.52s]  Yeah, like, like Lantern, for example, is one of the most broken things to ever be put
[3321.52s -> 3324.32s]  in League and everybody fucks it up.
[3324.32s -> 3330.94s]  people will will just mess up lantern because they'll throw it for souls or they'll mess up like you can literally just hold lantern perma and
[3331.72s -> 3333.72s]  Your ad carry can walk up
[3334.52s -> 3339.04s]  Auto the turret and and and you literally like they literally can't play the game after that
[3339.52s -> 3348.52s]  Like the enemy team I'm in because like there's nothing they can do to stop it
[3349.06s -> 3352.44s]  We can totally fight this by the way
[3353.32s -> 3356.92s]  So like I've done that before we're like my thresh. I know I have a good throw
[3356.92s -> 3358.92s]  Hold on. Let me let me win this team fight really quick
[3358.92s -> 3386.78s]  Give me a sec, okay cool, sorry I had to win that teamfight real quick.
[3386.78s -> 3393.78s]  Okay so as I was saying, there's a lot more to Thresh than people think right?
[3393.78s -> 3397.98s]  It's essentially, people overcomplicate what he needs to do.
[3397.98s -> 3401.78s]  So it's like Thresh is a very basic, like when you see Thresh in pro play, you don't
[3401.78s -> 3406.78s]  ever see what you do, but it's very rare that you see like the sick perma hooking like oh
[3406.78s -> 3408.14s]  my god.
[3408.14s -> 3413.18s]  It's mainly like they pick him for like Lantern, straight up.
[3413.18s -> 3417.06s]  Like when they when they pick Thresh in high elo, he's not picked to be the god tier, like
[3417.06s -> 3422.78s]  always landing perma CC hooks like flay god, like he's picked to like shut down engage
[3422.78s -> 3427.50s]  and remove kill threat to your carries.
[3427.50s -> 3430.64s]  That's all he's picked for.
[3430.64s -> 3435.43s]  But he's literally just an EW bot.
[3435.43s -> 3436.43s]  Armor stacking.
[3436.43s -> 3439.63s]  I mean, yeah, the armor thing on Thresh is nice, but it's I wouldn't say it's like OP
[3439.63s -> 3440.63s]  on his kit.
[3440.63s -> 3446.09s]  It just makes him like not die to 80 carries in two seconds
[3449.86s -> 3457.96s]  What what is happening, but I instantly know I'm playing with a good thresh player when I can walk up to the turret
[3461.70s -> 3463.70s]  When I can walk up to the turret and the threat
[3475.56s -> 3479.08s]  Sorry, I was trying to think and talk at the same time when I can walk up to the turret
[3479.08s -> 3483.06s]  My thresh player won't walk up and auto the turret with me. That's like the sign of a good thresh player
[3483.94s -> 3488.90s]  When we don't know where the enemy is and instead of walking up and trying to hit the turret to like help you kill the
[3488.90s -> 3493.66s]  turret, they'll stand in the back and literally just sit there and wait and hold lantern until
[3493.66s -> 3504.95s]  uh, they just hold their lantern until like you can, until you get ganked, essentially.
[3504.95s -> 3508.33s]  And that's why, like I said, I just personally don't think Thresh's mechanics are as hard
[3508.33s -> 3512.73s]  as people think. I do think he's, he's very knowledge based, like I think Thresh has high
[3512.73s -> 3519.13s]  knowledge caps, where like, if you're playing, I don't know, like Lulu, your skill is basically
[3519.13s -> 3525.45s]  like do I W your decision making on Lulu is literally do I W to speed or do I W to CC
[3525.45s -> 3529.49s]  right like that's your that's your decision making so it's like obviously much higher
[3529.49s -> 3539.81s]  than that but it's uh you son of a bitch but it's still not like that bad I think Thresh
[3539.81s -> 3546.65s]  just intimidates people because he can do so much and so I think people just get intimidated
[3546.65s -> 3549.17s]  but because they they think it looks overwhelming to learn the champ.
[3554.04s -> 3557.32s]  I feel like that actually intimidates a lot of people in terms of like people
[3557.32s -> 3560.60s]  not wanting to learn new champions and shits.
[3562.00s -> 3564.80s]  I feel like a lot of it is just.
[3566.20s -> 3570.00s]  People are nervous about learning champions that look overwhelming, right?
[3572.64s -> 3575.00s]  Like Aphelios, for example, I was talking about this yesterday.
[3575.00s -> 3579.68s]  Aphelios is not a hard mechanical champion like he's difficult
[3579.68s -> 3584.56s]  in terms of the knowledge required, like he's knowledge gated very hard
[3585.36s -> 3590.64s]  right? So like you have to play him a decent amount or like research him to understand
[3590.64s -> 3594.48s]  what guns do what, how to interact with the guns, stuff like that right?
[3594.48s -> 3598.96s]  But the actual mechanics of using the guns, it's actually not hard.
[3600.32s -> 3615.17s]  Guys what are we doing? I guess we're just winning the fight.
[3615.17s -> 3628.26s]  Wait, Pyke? Like, I think Pyke's harder than Thresh. Maybe that's a hot take, but I think
[3628.26s -> 3638.94s]  Pyke is harder than Thresh. Because Pyke requires like really specific- Pyke is a lot harder
[3638.94s -> 3646.54s]  to play than he looks when you see people play him. Because there's like timers of when
[3646.54s -> 3651.14s]  you can go in off of certain things. Like hitting his ulti consistently in teamfights
[3651.14s -> 3657.62s]  a little harder than people think and knowing how to position in the lane like pike is capable of a
[3657.62s -> 3662.66s]  lot more than people think so i think pike's i think the reason the main reason i think pike's
[3662.66s -> 3671.81s]  a little harder is because he's melee like melee champions are always going to be like mechanically
[3671.81s -> 3680.20s]  more difficult than ranged if the melee champion is like you have to engage to go in and do stuff
[3681.48s -> 3691.56s]  because there's always the counter play factor support role yeah that's what i'm saying it's
[3691.56s -> 3696.76s]  like i'm not saying overall like overall ranged champions require a lot more mechanics than melee
[3696.76s -> 3701.24s]  just because you're ranged you can die in a global and you have to space and stuff but i think that
[3701.24s -> 3706.68s]  like in just the support you support support specific i think melees are a lot harder to play
[3706.68s -> 3712.12s]  that's why you see a lot of like support players we give like the best support players in the world
[3712.12s -> 3716.44s]  are really good at like the engage melee supports not the like enchanters and that's why you see
[3716.44s -> 3723.70s]  like why we praise the best support players because like when you see somebody go in like
[3723.70s -> 3731.16s]  perfectly on Rakan or go in like find a way in without getting knocked up on like I don't know
[3732.52s -> 3736.52s]  something like when they find the angle on Thresh and shit it's really nice.
[3747.78s -> 3759.84s]  Rell? I think Rell sucks. I think that champ is so bad because she just like she doesn't do anything
[3759.84s -> 3767.52s]  Like, Rell's initial thing was like, she was supposed to go in, be really tanky, and then
[3767.52s -> 3771.28s]  be like a stun bot for like teamfights, she was a teamfight monster.
[3771.28s -> 3776.44s]  But the problem with Rell is like, she has one chance essentially in lane phase, like
[3776.44s -> 3781.40s]  if anybody has fingers on their hands, and they can move left and right, Rell's really
[3781.40s -> 3782.40s]  easy to dodge.
[3782.40s -> 3786.80s]  Like it's actually, like it's incredibly easy to beat a Rell in lane to not die to her.
[3786.80s -> 3789.60s]  Like, you just have to move left and right, right?
[3789.60s -> 3797.78s]  It's very simple, so it's like it's much more difficult to dodge like other engaged champs
[3797.78s -> 3800.84s]  if that makes sense like Nautilus you can still move left and right but it's like he
[3800.84s -> 3805.94s]  can walk at you while it's happening whereas like if Rell walks at you I'm still like just
[3805.94s -> 3812.70s]  waiting for the animation and then I can simply move to the left because like her animation
[3812.70s -> 3817.84s]  is so slow on using her ability that I can like dash I can flash I can there's so much
[3817.84s -> 3822.28s]  counter play and it's like unless she flashes on you but it's even then you can tell she's
[3822.28s -> 3829.80s]  to flash on you so it's like i also feel like mid game rel has this issue where she has her one
[3829.80s -> 3837.45s]  trick ulti engage fight in team fights but after she does that she does literally nothing right
[3837.45s -> 3843.60s]  she's like a one and done that's why like she feels like she doesn't have other expression
[3850.80s -> 3858.24s]  she's countered so hard by the meta too melio counters rel engage thresh counters rel engage
[3858.24s -> 3875.96s]  right like either either of those champions shits on rel engage and you can't do anything like i
[3875.96s -> 3882.92s]  don't know if you've ever tried to play rel gone in and been like thresh flayed but it's the worst
[3882.92s -> 3890.48s]  feeling it's a bad feeling it's like when people play leona it's the same reason leona's shit
[3890.48s -> 3897.28s]  right now like they both have the same idea of why they're bad right they like have they're
[3897.28s -> 3899.80s]  They're both good at doing what they're supposed to do,
[3899.80s -> 3901.48s]  like, you know, stun and create pressure
[3901.48s -> 3902.70s]  and point click and shit.
[3902.70s -> 3904.10s]  But the problem is, is like,
[3905.82s -> 3908.84s]  you can easily counter pick them so incredibly hard
[3908.84s -> 3915.01s]  that they just become worthless the whole game.
[3915.01s -> 3916.21s]  You ever gotten Senna's secondary mission?
[3916.21s -> 3917.71s]  Oh, all the time.
[3917.71s -> 3920.01s]  With Senna being, like with Thresh being meta
[3920.01s -> 3921.97s]  and Senna being like a champion I'm playing a lot,
[3921.97s -> 3926.01s]  I get that all the time.
[3926.01s -> 3928.33s]  You don't even notice it though, I'm gonna be real.
[3929.21s -> 3931.25s]  When you kill the Thresh or whatever and you get his souls,
[3931.25s -> 3940.77s]  You don't even fucking notice it because like it's like 40 armor and it's like you're level 17 or some shit at that point
[3941.69s -> 3947.33s]  Like at the point you're getting it. You're such a high level that like the 40 random armor like it's nice
[3947.33s -> 3955.90s]  But I never really notice it
[3955.90s -> 3963.34s]  Plenty of your teammates ahead. Isn't that good? You don't have actually been doing as support on my main account. I've actually been
[3965.54s -> 3976.33s]  Roaming non-stop and it's super OP because the key to roaming is
[3977.09s -> 3990.09s]  All you have to do to roam well is literally be there 1 or 2 times in the first 5 minutes of the game to completely fuck over the enemy one time on an engage or something
[3990.09s -> 3998.32s]  And they get so far behind from it that you can literally just walk back bot
[3998.32s -> 4003.32s]  Like I do it on Senna, like I'll push bot lane, this is my strategy on Senna, I'm gonna give it to you guys, okay?
[4003.32s -> 4009.32s]  So, I don't know if this works in LoL but in like high Masters this works at least
[4009.32s -> 4012.24s]  This is all I do on Senna.
[4012.24s -> 4016.90s]  Every single player I play against on Senna, every single one except for like Pyke players,
[4016.90s -> 4020.32s]  even Nautilus, Blitz, they all can see lane level 1.
[4020.32s -> 4021.32s]  Every single one of them.
[4021.32s -> 4022.32s]  Right?
[4022.32s -> 4024.16s]  They just let me push level 1.
[4024.16s -> 4029.68s]  And so I'll push the waves in level 1, and I'll either crash wave 2 or wave 3 depending
[4029.68s -> 4033.40s]  on how far they're giving me like push power, right?
[4033.40s -> 4041.26s]  So I will always crash wave 2 or wave 3 bot, and I will immediately roam mid.
[4041.26s -> 4043.36s]  Every time.
[4043.36s -> 4050.62s]  And even if I don't get a kill, usually it fucks over the enemy mid laner so badly because
[4050.62s -> 4060.22s]  on that exact timer, there's usually a gank happening on mid.
[4060.22s -> 4065.36s]  So a lot of the time, people think that you're roaming to get a kill for the laner.
[4065.36s -> 4074.11s]  not. You're roaming to counter pressure from the other players in the game. How many times
[4074.11s -> 4078.51s]  have you guys been like, oh, we can win this 2v2, you see the enemy jungler, your jungler
[4078.51s -> 4081.11s]  comes, you're like, oh, we're going to bait this. And then all of a sudden the support
[4081.11s -> 4086.07s]  shows up and you're like, God damn it. And then you die and you're like, what the fuck?
[4086.07s -> 4090.35s]  That right there is how easy it is to play support. Because all you have to do is show
[4090.35s -> 4102.52s]  up once, twice, and now that entire lane is fucked for the enemy team.
[4102.52s -> 4104.04s]  Roaming is so easy.
[4104.04s -> 4109.42s]  The only thing, people fuck up roaming really bad when they roam on timers where their AD
[4109.42s -> 4111.44s]  carry can't safely farm.
[4111.44s -> 4116.48s]  So what ends up happening is on that timer, right, where like I told you wave 2, 3, right?
[4116.48s -> 4119.72s]  What happens is you push that wave in, you roam mid.
[4119.72s -> 4121.12s]  Let's say nothing happens, okay?
[4121.12s -> 4123.76s]  I can just walk back bot.
[4123.76s -> 4124.76s]  You lose nothing.
[4124.76s -> 4129.56s]  And if usually at that point you're not you have like 300 gold so there's no point in backing right now
[4129.56s -> 4132.20s]  Let's say like I noticed that my jungler is like
[4133.04s -> 4136.00s]  Invading topside. I just walk over to top and help him
[4137.20s -> 4139.20s]  Because you have like three to four
[4139.92s -> 4146.36s]  You have like three to four waves before the enemy bot lane the enemy bot lane has to play it almost perfectly
[4147.00s -> 4153.94s]  To be able to abuse your roam on certain timers
[4153.94s -> 4158.90s]  They essentially have to play it perfect to abuse the roam.
[4158.90s -> 4165.28s]  What I mean by that is like, the best way to abuse a support roaming is to either A,
[4165.28s -> 4171.70s]  if you have the ability to dive, you can pretty much A, immediately dive, like push the next
[4171.70s -> 4175.06s]  wave and then immediately dive if you like have that ability, say you're playing Leona
[4175.06s -> 4176.46s]  Draven or something.
[4176.46s -> 4180.42s]  But even then it's a little risky because then the AD carry can just walk back and they
[4180.42s -> 4184.50s]  only lose one wave and you gave up you know a stack chance so it's not that bad
[4184.50s -> 4190.90s]  two you can stack the wave now stacking the wave is the best way to counter it
[4190.90s -> 4195.14s]  because let's say I'm roaming for an extended period you stack like a three
[4195.14s -> 4198.30s]  wave and then all of a sudden you're crashing it and my and then you want it
[4198.30s -> 4201.14s]  like you're up a level because you've been gaining XP and the ad carry has to
[4201.14s -> 4206.30s]  back off but the way to counter that is you simply just walk back on the timer
[4206.30s -> 4210.10s]  of the stacked wave crashing as an ad carry or as a support it's so
[4210.10s -> 4215.46s]  incredibly easy to do it's actually brainlessly easy to do like all it's
[4215.46s -> 4221.38s]  literally you can roam all you want bot lane as long as you are in bot lane for
[4221.38s -> 4225.66s]  the stacked wave crashes or you are in bot lane when your jungler is bot side of
[4225.66s -> 4237.55s]  the map it's easy as fuck but support players drool on themselves so they like
[4237.55s -> 4243.87s]  to essentially support players like to like afk in the lane phase they like to
[4243.87s -> 4249.65s]  literally sit there and just do nothing that's like the average support I see is
[4249.65s -> 4256.52s]  they will stand and do nothing and and I've said this before but I'll say it
[4256.52s -> 4260.00s]  again being a good support is not being a better player in the enemy team being
[4260.00s -> 4264.80s]  a good support is queuing up to play League of Legends that's that's all it
[4264.80s -> 4268.52s]  takes all it takes to be a good support is queuing up with the intent to push
[4268.52s -> 4503.84s]  buttons in the game and not just afk all right i'm back what's up i don't remember what we're
[4503.84s -> 4514.15s]  talking about oh supports yeah they're all stupid don't afk on support you'll gain lp so it's that
[4514.15s -> 4531.03s]  it's actually that easy honestly i don't think supports are stupid i think it's more of a uh
[4531.83s -> 4539.08s]  how do i phrase this it's uh in my opinion it's more of like uh they're like they've never they
[4539.08s -> 4549.59s]  don't have to learn support players like don't have to learn uh important things because they can
[4549.59s -> 4553.03s]  get away with not doing it so they get they develop bad habits that's all it is
[4562.55s -> 4573.12s]  do you have a spotify playlist yeah best role to climb i think every role is good to climb
[4573.68s -> 4578.56s]  as long as you're good classic jarrah oh i don't see whatever you linked like i don't
[4578.56s -> 4581.36s]  know a lot of links in the chat because i had to turn them off a long time ago
[4581.36s -> 4592.42s]  So I can't see it. I would say though climbing is just about like whatever
[4592.42s -> 4597.38s]  because every role you can climb on right like every single role so climbing a lot
[4597.38s -> 4606.44s]  of the time is just about what you think is most fun for you and you can get the
[4606.44s -> 4613.52s]  best at. I would say objectively the best roles to climb on are jungle and support
[4613.52s -> 4620.84s]  for just like higher elo. Well jungle and lower elo, support and higher elo. I
[4620.84s -> 4623.20s]  I wouldn't climb on support in like gold
[4624.24s -> 4627.96s]  Cuz you're not gonna have a good time trying to like help bad players play the game
[4629.44s -> 4636.08s]  Bad it's mean I people who don't like you can get it like a gold Ezreal 30 kills by being the better support
[4636.28s -> 4638.00s]  But you won't always win
[4638.00s -> 4644.00s]  Whereas like if you really want to control solo queue and your teammates aren't like good enough to carry at that level
[4644.00s -> 4650.64s]  level by themselves, right? Like you get frustrated. Just pick something that has more agency in
[4650.64s -> 4662.96s]  the game. You lost 18 of 24 as jungle. You want to try a new role? I mean, you can play
[4662.96s -> 4670.80s]  AD if you think it's AD carry is interesting. I wouldn't say it's like fun, but it's not,
[4670.80s -> 4683.28s]  it's not bad. You're in gold. I mean, you could try it. My view on it is if people were
[4683.28s -> 4687.20s]  wondering if they want to play a role or not, my view is just try it, see if you like it.
[4687.20s -> 4689.92s]  if you don't like the role you're not gonna be able to put in enough games to get good at the
[4689.92s -> 4696.16s]  role right so like just give it a try see if you enjoy it or not and if like it's not fun then if
[4696.16s -> 4700.80s]  it's not your playstyle it's not fun because ad is a very unique playstyle from all the other roles
[4702.48s -> 4709.68s]  like the reason people don't like playing ad carry and like like watching ad carry streamers and shit
[4709.68s -> 4716.20s]  it is because AD carry is like, it's boring.
[4716.20s -> 4721.31s]  AD carry is like zero, like if there was a graph of shit
[4721.31s -> 4723.27s]  going on when you're playing AD carry in the game,
[4723.27s -> 4725.95s]  it's like this, then it's like spikes to a hundred
[4725.95s -> 4728.39s]  and then it's back to like this, right?
[4728.39s -> 4735.34s]  It's like, AD carry is a lot of, every game is different.
[4736.32s -> 4737.16s]  Right?
[4737.16s -> 4738.76s]  Every game when you play AD is different.
[4740.00s -> 4743.80s]  Because you're always with a different player,
[4743.80s -> 4748.44s]  a different support unless you duo queue. So every adc game is different, coupled with
[4750.28s -> 4754.04s]  you spend a lot of the game just farming. Like you don't get to interact with the enemy a lot.
[4754.84s -> 4758.68s]  So you just kind of farm a lot of the game and even then you also like,
[4760.36s -> 4763.48s]  you basically are farming for like little dopamine hits of like team fights and stuff
[4763.48s -> 4770.04s]  that you get around the game. So that's kind of fun. But it's like I said, it's all you,
[4770.04s -> 4775.08s]  you can climb on any role. I think adc requires the most mechanical skill to climb because
[4775.08s -> 4780.20s]  Because the difference between, uh, climbing is like a jungler is about being in the right
[4780.20s -> 4781.44s]  spot at the right time, right?
[4781.44s -> 4784.40s]  Like you need to path this way, get objectives, et cetera.
[4784.40s -> 4788.00s]  Climbing as an AD carry is more about like this person fucked up their positioning.
[4788.00s -> 4790.04s]  I'm going to kill them type shit.
[4790.04s -> 4818.48s]  Recon started Q.
[4818.48s -> 4825.80s]  Also, I want to, I want to say something, uh, if you are playing, make sure, and this
[4825.80s -> 4829.40s]  is just a really good standardized bit of advice.
[4829.40s -> 4832.88s]  Make sure you're always tracking what the enemy cooldowns are, what their spells are,
[4832.88s -> 4837.68s]  stuff like that, okay?
[4837.68s -> 4841.96s]  Because playing the game is not just about farming and your team goes in and you auto
[4841.96s -> 4842.96s]  and shit.
[4842.96s -> 4844.10s]  Like right now, mid's Mia, right?
[4844.10s -> 4848.64s]  I can see that Varus is Mia, but it is a Varus, so I'm not too worried about being level
[4848.64s -> 4850.56s]  2'd by a Varus.
[4850.56s -> 4851.88s]  Not that much, right?
[4851.88s -> 4856.40s]  So I can kind of play backward because I know that it's a high chance he's not going to
[4856.40s -> 4857.40s]  Rumbot a level 2 as a Varus.
[4857.40s -> 4861.06s]  Now if that was like a Fizz or some shit, I immediately back up.
[4861.06s -> 4865.34s]  So we notice that it's pretty obvious Rakan probably got W level 2, we don't know what
[4865.34s -> 4868.38s]  it is, but he has Q. So he doesn't have shield.
[4868.38s -> 4878.73s]  Which means, because he doesn't have shield, it's hard for the Rakan to get back out if
[4878.73s -> 4880.91s]  he fucks up an engage.
[4880.91s -> 4883.03s]  So you need to think about these type of things, right?
[4883.03s -> 4888.31s]  Now this is wave 4 I believe, and because it's wave 4, we're gonna get level 3 on wave
[4888.31s -> 4889.31s]  4.
[4889.31s -> 4894.39s]  You always get level 3 on wave 4 if you have full XP.
[4894.39s -> 4899.39s]  You get level 2 on wave 2, and you get level 3 on wave 4.
[4899.39s -> 4907.96s]  And these timers for when you get certain level ups, bot lane, are very important.
[4907.96s -> 4910.64s]  Now I'm gonna hover over here.
[4910.64s -> 4913.52s]  You see how Fiddle is right here?
[4913.52s -> 4916.76s]  I'm actually gonna just walk in here and see if I can like...
[4916.76s -> 4919.00s]  Yeah, we see him.
[4919.00s -> 4920.00s]  Nice.
[4920.00s -> 4922.76s]  See, this is exactly what I was talking about before.
[4922.76s -> 4925.60s]  Do you see what my support is doing?
[4925.60s -> 4929.32s]  I left the lane, guys.
[4929.32s -> 4932.04s]  I walked to like stand next to my jungler
[4932.04s -> 4933.68s]  after we pushed the wave in.
[4933.68s -> 4938.68s]  My Lulu is hanging out by herself bot lane.
[4941.62s -> 4958.77s]  Like she's just chilling.
[4958.77s -> 4960.87s]  You don't want to do that.
[4960.87s -> 4962.49s]  You don't ever want to be the guy
[4962.49s -> 4965.69s]  who's like by yourself bot lane as a support.
[4966.93s -> 4970.53s]  Because you don't, like supports don't need gold, right?
[4970.53s -> 4972.05s]  Not really.
[4972.05s -> 4974.13s]  And you don't need farm, you don't need all that shit.
[4974.13s -> 4976.93s]  So if your AD carry roams, and unless the wave is fucked
[4976.93s -> 4977.77s]  and they're just being stupid
[4977.77s -> 4979.41s]  and you have to fix the wave or something,
[4979.41s -> 4981.75s]  you don't wanna be by yourself in the lane.
[4981.75s -> 4985.89s]  It just doesn't do anything.
[4985.89s -> 4987.05s]  How did I not auto tower?
[4987.05s -> 4990.57s]  Oh, I used Tilda.
[4990.57s -> 4992.85s]  So there's a way, there's actually a setting
[4992.85s -> 4995.85s]  you can have in the game where when you hit a button,
[4995.85s -> 4998.13s]  it makes it so that I can't physically hit
[4998.13s -> 5000.01s]  anything but a champion.
[5000.01s -> 5003.65s]  It's Target, it's called Target Champions Only,
[5003.65s -> 5005.23s]  And it's basically like, here, I'll do it for you right now.
[5005.23s -> 5006.07s]  Watch.
[5006.07s -> 5007.41s]  You see how like I can hit the tower?
[5007.41s -> 5009.73s]  You see how it's the red sword?
[5011.59s -> 5013.09s]  So when I hit this button,
[5013.09s -> 5015.35s]  I can no longer hit the tower or the minions,
[5016.39s -> 5018.25s]  but I can still hit the champions.
[5020.01s -> 5023.11s]  So essentially when you're fighting in a big minion wave
[5023.11s -> 5024.75s]  or you're fighting under a turret,
[5024.75s -> 5026.11s]  you don't want to misclick.
[5027.29s -> 5029.95s]  You just hit target champions only button.
[5029.95s -> 5032.03s]  And it makes it a thousand times easier
[5032.03s -> 5036.58s]  because you can literally only hit the champion.
[5036.58s -> 5047.79s]  It's really nice.
[5047.79s -> 5049.71s]  And you can make the button anything you want, obviously.
[5049.71s -> 5057.64s]  I just, I use tilde, it's the default.
[5057.64s -> 5059.64s]  I actually wanna kill these guys,
[5059.64s -> 5063.08s]  but I need to wait for the wave to push out just a hair.
[5063.08s -> 5065.00s]  The jungler could be bought, but it is a Fiddlesticks,
[5065.00s -> 5065.88s]  so it's like, I don't really care
[5065.88s -> 5067.42s]  about a Fiddlesticks being bought.
[5067.42s -> 5081.59s]  We can straight up just kill them.
[5081.59s -> 5087.18s]  Okay, well, apparently we can't kill them,
[5087.18s -> 5090.28s]  because apparently my Lulu didn't wanna walk up.
[5091.30s -> 5093.20s]  That's so frustrating, man.
[5093.20s -> 5098.10s]  I did fuck up my auto there, but I am a little,
[5098.10s -> 5100.64s]  I am kind of curious what happens.
[5100.64s -> 5101.60s]  I'd have to go watch the VOD.
[5101.60s -> 5102.96s]  I fucked up my kill on the Xayah.
[5102.96s -> 5105.44s]  I think I walked left instead, or down.
[5105.44s -> 5107.04s]  My movement was bad.
[5107.04s -> 5108.82s]  Like essentially when they fought, right?
[5108.82s -> 5110.08s]  I walked like this.
[5110.08s -> 5112.02s]  I should have walked like this,
[5112.02s -> 5115.04s]  because you want to cut off the Xayah from the gank.
[5115.04s -> 5118.12s]  Now I do think when Lulu just blindly ran away,
[5118.12s -> 5119.84s]  I think she kind of griefed.
[5119.84s -> 5121.60s]  You don't need to insta run from ganks,
[5121.60s -> 5123.16s]  especially when like, you could see what I have, right?
[5123.16s -> 5125.96s]  I have Dirk and Sheen.
[5125.96s -> 5130.20s]  Something that a lot of people do as well, is they will see that the numbers are uneven,
[5130.20s -> 5131.36s]  and they'll instantly run away.
[5131.36s -> 5135.28s]  They don't think about how to win the fight, or what the win con is of the fight.
[5135.28s -> 5137.28s]  Because that's what I was saying before we got ganked, right?
[5137.28s -> 5138.60s]  I was like, Fiddle can't gank us.
[5138.60s -> 5139.60s]  And he can't.
[5139.60s -> 5141.40s]  Pre-6, Fiddle does nothing in the gank.
[5141.40s -> 5145.96s]  I had Cleanse, they don't actually beat us in 3v2.
[5145.96s -> 5148.80s]  So the problem was, is we weren't focusing the same target.
[5148.80s -> 5152.12s]  I went for the Xayah, and she backed really far up.
[5152.12s -> 5154.12s]  If we had played forward a bit
[5154.40s -> 5158.44s]  Like say she played a little more forward with me that would have gone a lot better or if I had played a little more
[5158.44s -> 5166.38s]  Back with her. It was basically like we don't have comms. So the you know, it got rough now fiddle is six now
[5166.74s -> 5168.74s]  So it's a little scary. I
[5169.46s -> 5173.44s]  Don't like playing versus fiddle sticks for like the reason of like 90% of the time
[5174.42s -> 5178.14s]  Players don't know how to ward around fiddle people put wards in weird spots
[5178.74s -> 5182.89s]  We should have won that fight though. I'm a little salty
[5182.89s -> 5199.88s]  So this too, Lulu keeps speeding me up, I'm gonna be honest with you, I don't like when
[5199.88s -> 5203.97s]  Lulu's do that.
[5203.97s -> 5208.97s]  It's like a pet peeve thing of mine when Lulu's use their speed, I'm okay with it if I need
[5208.97s -> 5213.01s]  to dodge something or I need to chase somebody, but I think it's just so much less value than
[5213.01s -> 5215.69s]  using it to CC early game.
[5215.69s -> 5221.69s]  Early game, the CC of Lulu using W is so broken to me because they just physically can't move
[5221.69s -> 5235.64s]  their character for like 1.5 seconds, which is crazy. I think Fiddle's bot. You can kind
[5235.64s -> 5243.98s]  of tell. You see how they're playing really aggressive? They don't beat us 2v2. So I'm
[5243.98s -> 5249.02s]  thinking, and they just cleared this ward out. I'm thinking Fiddle is either on dragon
[5249.02s -> 5258.58s]  or he's bush ganking bot somewhere. So I don't really want to walk up. You see how this guy
[5258.58s -> 5265.36s]  is confidently hitting the turret, this is making me think Fiddle's trying to lane gank.
[5265.36s -> 5270.84s]  Because they cannot beat us 2v2. Like, I think Fiddle's in here.
[5273.38s -> 5277.78s]  So, I'm actually just going to play safe. Until we see him on the map, I don't know.
[5279.62s -> 5293.67s]  I'm not going to take the chance. Because, uh, you gotta think about, like, what you see and
[5293.67s -> 5297.59s]  what you don't see on the map. Like, we can't physically see Fiddle, right? But think about
[5297.59s -> 5302.07s]  this, we don't see him top. That's something you have to think about. We had a ward on Rift just
[5302.07s -> 5304.73s]  just now for 15 seconds, right?
[5305.73s -> 5307.03s]  We didn't see him top.
[5308.01s -> 5313.22s]  So like, if he's not top, where is he?
[5313.22s -> 5315.54s]  Now I think he finally left.
[5315.54s -> 5320.61s]  This looks like he went to dragon.
[5320.61s -> 5330.28s]  Yeah.
[5330.28s -> 5331.78s]  What are we doing, by the way?
[5332.96s -> 5336.36s]  I mean, I guess I'm just gonna die.
[5336.36s -> 5338.02s]  Now would be the time to speed me.
[5338.96s -> 5341.42s]  I mean, I don't even know what to say about that.
[5341.42s -> 5346.62s]  Malzahar just didn't walk.
[5346.62s -> 5349.14s]  Gragas didn't flash his E.
[5349.14s -> 5350.66s]  Malzahar didn't walk.
[5352.10s -> 5353.86s]  You always walk there, by the way.
[5353.86s -> 5355.42s]  I wanna make this clear.
[5355.42s -> 5356.54s]  If you're a mid laner
[5356.54s -> 5359.50s]  and you're playing a late game scaling mid,
[5359.50s -> 5362.02s]  you always walk to the fight no matter what though.
[5362.02s -> 5364.16s]  If it's doing that.
[5365.78s -> 5366.82s]  Okay, guys.
[5368.30s -> 5370.46s]  We need to walk to fights.
[5370.46s -> 5374.98s]  And Lulu, you need to follow up when I go in.
[5374.98s -> 5378.26s]  Don't run.
[5378.26s -> 5379.10s]  I'm just gonna type it
[5379.10s -> 5382.37s]  because I'm actually fucking annoyed.
[5382.37s -> 5383.81s]  I'm a little frustrated.
[5383.81s -> 5385.49s]  I still think the game is 100% winnable,
[5385.49s -> 5387.17s]  but I'm playing Draven.
[5387.17s -> 5391.01s]  We're playing like I'm playing fucking Ezreal or some shit.
[5391.01s -> 5393.37s]  And I can't walk up because essentially,
[5393.37s -> 5395.45s]  we know Fiddle was bot for the last two, three minutes,
[5395.45s -> 5405.01s]  right, he just sat down there.
[5405.01s -> 5406.39s]  What is my Lulu doing?
[5406.39s -> 5411.04s]  Bro, what are you doing?
[5411.04s -> 5412.42s]  No, we fight this, go.
[5413.76s -> 5420.35s]  Yeah, this guy doesn't get to do this for free.
[5420.35s -> 5423.59s]  Now they have a Galeforce, so I need to be a little care.
[5423.59s -> 5428.10s]  This guy has no ulti though.
[5428.10s -> 5431.08s]  Like, this is what, I'm losing my mind, man.
[5432.04s -> 5438.94s]  Like, dude, just follow.
[5438.94s -> 5441.30s]  No, what she was doing was she was trying
[5441.30s -> 5442.60s]  to protect her ward.
[5444.38s -> 5446.26s]  She saw the Rakan hitting the ward,
[5446.26s -> 5449.46s]  but the Xayah walked up to get a free to just die.
[5449.46s -> 5451.10s]  The problem is, my Lulu was like,
[5451.10s -> 5452.74s]  oh, I don't wanna give up my ward,
[5452.74s -> 5458.62s]  and she wasn't thinking.
[5458.62s -> 5462.08s]  Please just sit with me, okay?
[5463.38s -> 5464.22s]  Caps, sorry.
[5464.22s -> 5470.14s]  I need you to follow me, always.
[5470.14s -> 5484.57s]  Even if it looks scary, you gotta follow, okay?
[5484.57s -> 5489.97s]  Also, one thing is, there's actually not a lot of fighting that happens in lower elo,
[5489.97s -> 5493.57s]  so a lot of these players don't know how to fight early.
[5493.57s -> 5497.73s]  Because one thing that I think has gotten really bad about League lately, just in the
[5497.73s -> 5503.97s]  past few years is people don't ever limit test in league ever anymore. They always just
[5503.97s -> 5509.29s]  play like pussies. Every single player in league plays like a fucking pussy nowadays.
[5509.29s -> 5524.28s]  And it's literally just like sad to see. Like right there. Why aren't we W'ing? Use W. On
[5524.28s -> 5534.31s]  the Xayah. Not to speed. Like, I'm losing my mind. Because all you have to do there
[5534.31s -> 5540.79s]  is w the zhaya she gets cc'd we kill her in the w i'm telling you lulu players are like hard wired
[5541.67s -> 5564.16s]  for some reason to not play correctly i'm never gonna catch this guy he's got galeforce and tier
[5564.16s -> 5573.99s]  2 boots yeah i mean i i have to go for it though because if i don't go for kills now the game's
[5573.99s -> 5582.66s]  over so it's either we go for it or we lose so i'm willing to like look stupid honestly this
[5582.66s -> 5588.18s]  game was my fault for the one 2v3 that happened early i misplayed it and if i didn't misplay that
[5588.34s -> 5590.58s]  we would have won the game off it.
[5590.58s -> 5592.18s]  Now the game's pretty much over.
[5593.34s -> 5595.46s]  Like, it's solo queue so we can always come back,
[5595.46s -> 5599.26s]  but the problem is, I don't think we have good enough
[5599.26s -> 5600.66s]  players to come back.
[5600.66s -> 5603.42s]  Like, look at what Lulu's doing, Lulu.
[5603.42s -> 5606.30s]  Why are you bot solo at the moment?
[5606.30s -> 5609.33s]  Think.
[5609.33s -> 5610.21s]  Like, what?
[5610.21s -> 5611.05s]  He's, ah!
[5612.45s -> 5622.04s]  What are we doing?
[5622.04s -> 5624.12s]  This is exactly what I was telling you guys.
[5624.12s -> 5625.64s]  Doesn't make sense.
[5625.64s -> 5627.12s]  Remember when I told you support's easy?
[5627.12s -> 5629.68s]  all you have to do is be a human.
[5629.68s -> 5631.62s]  Remember when I said that 40 sec...
[5631.62s -> 5633.48s]  or four minutes ago before the game started.
[5633.48s -> 5638.04s]  All you have to do to play support is think,
[5638.04s -> 5640.04s]  push buttons, and be active in the game.
[5640.04s -> 5642.18s]  And if you can do those things, you'll get Challenger
[5642.18s -> 5643.02s]  on support.
[5643.02s -> 5648.05s]  Like, it blows my mind.
[5648.05s -> 5649.93s]  Like, look what she's...
[5649.93s -> 5651.33s]  What are you doing?
[5651.33s -> 5672.59s]  This is a forfeit though.
[5672.59s -> 5674.03s]  I'm going to lose my minds.
[5674.03s -> 5678.13s]  Auto-filled AD.
[5678.13s -> 5683.59s]  I'm going to lose it.
[5683.59s -> 5692.20s]  My bad, guys.
[5692.20s -> 5693.88s]  I'm an auto-filled AD. I'm just bad.
[5693.88s -> 5695.88s]  It's on me. I apologize.
[5704.30s -> 5706.30s]  Oh, man, these players are crazy.
[5710.01s -> 5712.01s]  I'm, actually really surprised we're just not forfeiting now.
[5715.42s -> 5720.30s]  The best way to play the game is something that like I fall victim to too where I fuck this up sometimes, right?
[5720.86s -> 5722.86s]  But the best way to play the game a lot of the time is
[5723.58s -> 5726.06s]  you essentially don't play to take risks.
[5728.06s -> 5732.54s]  I know it sounds silly because you got to find essentially you have to find the um,
[5732.54s -> 5741.92s]  My Malzahar just let this guy, this 1000 gold walk away.
[5743.16s -> 5748.16s]  Hey Malz, if you moved by the way, you get 1k gold.
[5756.10s -> 5759.38s]  Mid isn't hard role.
[5759.38s -> 5765.36s]  I can mid in my sleep.
[5765.36s -> 5766.92s]  It's not.
[5766.92s -> 5775.88s]  AD is easiest role.
[5775.88s -> 5778.36s]  I'm AD carry streamer.
[5778.36s -> 5779.64s]  I play AD.
[5779.64s -> 5789.42s]  But Lulu is small brain.
[5789.42s -> 5790.48s]  That was mean.
[5790.48s -> 5792.58s]  Lulu took some crossfire there.
[5792.58s -> 5796.64s]  that she didn't need to take, that was my bad.
[5796.64s -> 5815.68s]  That was toxic.
[5815.68s -> 5817.68s]  I'll be real, I think today's gonna be
[5817.68s -> 5819.20s]  a mute all kind of day.
[5819.20s -> 5822.74s]  Listening to low elo players talk about the game,
[5822.74s -> 5824.56s]  and then they think that they're right about the game
[5824.56s -> 5826.16s]  and like how it works and all this shit,
[5826.16s -> 5827.52s]  it actually like hurts me.
[5827.52s -> 5829.88s]  Like, it shouldn't, I should just laugh it off,
[5829.88s -> 5832.32s]  but sometimes, when I see a low elo player
[5832.32s -> 5834.48s]  talk about how they think the game should be played,
[5834.48s -> 5836.40s]  and I just know that they're wrong,
[5836.40s -> 5841.95s]  it actually like physically hurts me.
[5841.95s -> 5853.56s]  It does, it physically hurts.
[5853.56s -> 5860.00s]  But I should follow my own rule where if you're playing with people that aren't as good, like they don't see what you see
[5860.60s -> 5865.70s]  Right, there's like something where it's better to play safe and scale even on Draven
[5865.92s -> 5869.28s]  It's better to play safe and scale than to go for plays in lane
[5872.92s -> 5874.92s]  Mainly because
[5876.00s -> 5882.20s]  If you go for plays in lane and let's say your support is not as good as you or your supports not
[5882.20s -> 5886.76s]  confident in their ability to 2v2 right then you're just gonna lose so you're like forcing
[5886.76s -> 5893.56s]  that person to be in an uncomfortable situation so like it's hard for me as a player to just play
[5893.56s -> 5899.08s]  safe when i see the enemy making mistake after mistake it's like something that i have trouble
[5899.08s -> 5904.20s]  like personally working on right just like a personal issue where like i'll see an enemy
[5904.20s -> 5908.60s]  make a mistake positional wise i'm like oh shit let's abuse this but a lot of the time the problem
[5908.60s -> 5913.80s]  that happens is you have somebody who doesn't know that that person made a mistake or doesn't see the
[5913.80s -> 5918.52s]  same mistake as me and because there's no comms i can't relate to them that we should fight right
[5918.52s -> 5923.32s]  so if i go in and they don't know that we should be fighting there i i end up dying and it looks it
[5923.32s -> 5932.60s]  feels really bad which is i mean my fault it's like a personal thing because you can't control
[5932.60s -> 5937.48s]  your supports you can only control yourself it's just something that like i suck at doing sometimes
[5937.48s -> 5968.20s]  Right, so that's just on me. We could actually kill the Zire right now by the way. She's like 60% HP
[5968.96s -> 5995.69s]  Like we could kill her. What is my Gragas doing? Oh
[5997.31s -> 6006.82s]  He got her though nice bro use W
[6008.26s -> 6010.26s]  To CC people
[6011.06s -> 6012.94s]  Not to speed people
[6012.94s -> 6029.28s]  That was a good example too. Oh, well, I just got to get better at doing that where I play safe though
[6029.28s -> 6032.16s]  That's on me. That's just a personal thing I got to get better at.
[6059.80s -> 6063.40s]  Oh man. I think we're warmed up though. What AD carry do you guys want to see next game?
[6064.84s -> 6069.64s]  That was, that was a brutal ass game. I'm gonna be real. That was a brutal ass game.
[6071.24s -> 6074.44s]  What AD carry streamer do you guys want to see? Or AD carry stream? What AD carry
[6076.52s -> 6084.66s]  champion do you guys want to see this game? I just goofed up and tried to play too aggressive
[6084.66s -> 6087.06s]  with a player that wasn't willing to play aggressive. That was on me.
[6087.06s -> 6111.27s]  That's my bad. I'll play better. This guy, this guy goes scion.
[6111.27s -> 6142.93s]  Oh, never change Twitch chat, never change. Well, the thing is, is I have to change my
[6142.93s -> 6146.45s]  mindset. So like the thing that, okay, let me explain something. It's like a personal thing
[6146.45s -> 6151.17s]  with me. I'm very, very, very good mechanically at this game, right? Like it's my best trade.
[6151.17s -> 6158.85s]  is like I have very good mechanics so and I also have like an autistic weird brain where I can see
[6159.81s -> 6165.65s]  I have really good pattern recognition so when I see that the enemy is fucking up I know that
[6165.65s -> 6173.89s]  I'm pretty much always going to be better at the 2v2 okay so because I know that I'm always going
[6173.89s -> 6181.25s]  to be better at the 2v2. I always want to take the fight when I see that they make a mistake,
[6181.25s -> 6187.17s]  like they miss a skill shot, or they walk up too far, stuff like that, right? But the problem is,
[6187.17s -> 6191.33s]  when you're bot lane, you have to work with a teammate. And that's part of just playing
[6191.33s -> 6197.01s]  AD carry, right? And if you're in solo queue, you can't always duo. So you have to, I have to like
[6197.01s -> 6203.97s]  train myself to just be okay with them making mistakes and us not abusing those mistakes,
[6205.09s -> 6209.25s]  it's very frustrating for me personally because I'm a perfectionist, so it's very frustrating for
[6209.25s -> 6212.69s]  me to like see this happening and I'm like oh I want to abuse this because I know we can,
[6212.69s -> 6217.89s]  but we have to like I have to like tell myself not to and to just like not fuck up the wave state,
[6217.89s -> 6222.77s]  not take bad trades and shit, because every time there's there's more to it too, so if like I walk
[6222.77s -> 6226.69s]  up and I take a fight right let's say like when Rakan W'd in when the Fiddle ganked for example
[6226.69s -> 6234.37s]  right uh if i take that fight i'm now banking that fight on lulu also playing correctly right
[6234.37s -> 6239.65s]  like they they missed all their abilities and they fucked up but i also messed like
[6241.81s -> 6246.13s]  you nobody can play perfectly every game like i can't teammates can't nobody can it's league
[6246.13s -> 6250.21s]  we're all humans right so you have to bank when you're doing that on like your teammate being
[6250.21s -> 6255.73s]  able to know what you want to accomplish in that moment in solo queue with no comms and it's really
[6255.73s -> 6261.49s]  hard like it's it's a really bad mindset that i have sometimes but it's hard to get over because
[6261.49s -> 6270.95s]  like i like the landing phase for me is the most fun part of the game i love landing phase because
[6270.95s -> 6274.47s]  in my opinion landing phase is like a little mini chess game between the enemy bot lane right
[6275.75s -> 6281.03s]  it's like a it's like a chess game with like mechanics where it's like how how well can
[6281.03s -> 6286.95s]  like i auto space them right can i can i space them well can i space them like can i by spacing
[6286.95s -> 6291.67s]  I mean, can I walk into them trade and not take damage back right and I'm always thinking to myself
[6291.83s -> 6294.79s]  Okay, can I do that? I can and then I'm like I want to do this, right?
[6295.27s -> 6299.03s]  And then i'll like get somebody to half and then they'll panic and they'll engage on me
[6299.51s -> 6306.23s]  And the problem is though is like I said without comms or without like people who are recognizing what you're trying to accomplish
[6307.19s -> 6311.13s]  sometimes uh supports and junglers people get flustered
[6311.13s -> 6317.57s]  And it will go badly and it's my fault at the end of the day because I'm choosing to that play style of relying on
[6317.57s -> 6324.17s]  My teammates instead of like knowing that I can probably out scale and play better late-game and just like keep good CS and not die
[6324.17s -> 6330.77s]  And shit, which is what you guys should all do and that's what I tell people to do when they ask me how to play ad
[6330.77s -> 6333.57s]  I tell you like don't die scale up get items
[6334.07s -> 6338.09s]  but like because I've played the game for so long and my favorite part of the game is
[6338.09s -> 6343.09s]  is lane phase and like winning lane and playing that little chess game.
[6343.37s -> 6347.57s]  I fucked myself over in a lot of games because I'll like, you know,
[6347.59s -> 6351.73s]  force fights that like my teammate would have to play well in as well to win.
[6352.09s -> 6352.93s]  And uh,
[6352.93s -> 6355.29s]  I'll make a mistake or they'll make a mistake and we'll just lose the game off
[6355.29s -> 6360.21s]  it. And it's not a good play style, right?
[6360.21s -> 6363.85s]  It's not a good play style, but that's just like something that like,
[6363.85s -> 6369.61s]  I know other people probably also have and I'm telling you that like if you want to climb you got to get out of that
[6369.85s -> 6371.85s]  mindset and get into the mindset of like
[6373.01s -> 6382.51s]  Consistency because you can see last game. For example, I just straight up like lost the game off of me
[6383.91s -> 6389.19s]  Trying to fight when my support didn't know how to fight or want to fight and we lost the game off it
[6391.65s -> 6396.97s]  Like I was too aggro and even though if they did play correctly we win they didn't so we lost
[6396.97s -> 6403.69s]  so it's basically like it's just not like a good uh it's not a good uh what's the word i'm looking
[6403.69s -> 6417.66s]  for strategy because last game was my fault because i'm good enough at the game that i know
[6417.66s -> 6421.82s]  that i can't play like that if i want to be consistent and i still played like it so it's
[6421.82s -> 6432.66s]  my bad all right what are we playing this game boys we got rengar karma jhin what do people want
[6432.66s -> 6435.30s]  want to see let me see if any of the ad carries people want to see if i can play these
[6437.22s -> 6441.06s]  i can't play vayne into this the vayne would be way too hard in the carmagen i would just get
[6441.06s -> 6459.88s]  zoned off the wave i could play aphelios this is actually a good aphelios game you know what
[6459.88s -> 6466.60s]  kind of sucks i feel kind of bad playing aphelios when i'm on my like teaching accounts like this
[6466.60s -> 6473.16s]  account to like teach you guys i feel bad playing aphelios sometimes uh because i know a lot of
[6473.16s -> 6478.36s]  people don't want to learn aphelios or play aphelios because he is like really
[6480.52s -> 6485.64s]  he's very unique like he's he's hard to learn for a lot of people
[6486.36s -> 6493.56s]  so i feel i always feel kind of bad doing it right but i'll be real i don't know in this
[6493.56s -> 6498.36s]  specific situation outside of like jinx i didn't really know what else to pick
[6498.36s -> 6504.36s]  like jinx is good kaisa is probably okay but you still get zoned off the wave on kaisa
[6511.94s -> 6521.05s]  because like if we if we look at this right uh kaisa would have been i guess okay but when
[6521.05s -> 6526.49s]  you're picking a champion for bot lane right when you're picking a champion for bot lane uh one
[6526.49s -> 6529.69s]  thing that you guys should think about when picking like what you know what champion you
[6529.69s -> 6533.05s]  want to play unless you're a one trick and then play whatever you want but if you're like somebody
[6533.05s -> 6537.61s]  who wants to actually like play the meta and learn why champions are meta and when to pick what
[6540.98s -> 6548.50s]  they picked jhin karma now we have a lulu if we had something with a hook like a nautilus a blitz
[6548.50s -> 6554.90s]  a thresh a pike like if we had something like that i could pick a low range fighter right like i could
[6554.90s -> 6560.26s]  pick a low range fighter if we had a hook champ but because we don't have a hook champ and we have a
[6560.26s -> 6566.18s]  an enchanter, I have to pick something that can safely consistently farm and not get zoned off
[6566.18s -> 6570.98s]  by their bot lane. So there's not a lot of options that can do that. There's like,
[6571.62s -> 6575.06s]  I didn't want to pick, you could pick Ezreal here, it's not the worst, but we had a Lulu,
[6575.06s -> 6579.06s]  so I didn't want to pick Ezreal because Lulu goes to waste. So it's like you could pick Jinx,
[6579.06s -> 6582.42s]  but I kind of didn't want to pick Jinx this game because Jinx bores the shit out of me right now.
[6583.30s -> 6588.02s]  So this would be a good Jinx game though, if you guys are curious, like this would be a completely
[6588.02s -> 6595.82s]  fine jinx game your e stops rengar jump uh you can follow up really easily with lulu like this
[6595.82s -> 6602.54s]  would be a good jinx game um but aphelios it's a good aphelios game too it's both it's good
[6602.54s -> 6608.46s]  aphelios game good jinx game um it could be a good zary game zary wouldn't be that bad here
[6609.02s -> 6613.98s]  with lulu and against their comp uh they're all really squishy she's really mobile can get away
[6613.98s -> 6621.90s]  from like rengar ganks pretty easily tristana i okay so trist is unique because you only pick
[6621.90s -> 6630.14s]  tristana if you plan on winning lane okay tristana doesn't actually scale better than jinx in any way
[6631.90s -> 6637.82s]  like she does not have a better scaling than jinx trist trist versus jinx three items jinx wins
[6637.82s -> 6643.98s]  every time in teamfights no matter what like you she just does what Trist does better um
[6645.10s -> 6648.46s]  now the reason you pick Trist is because you do want to win lane you want to like
[6648.46s -> 6651.66s]  jump in you want to kill them you want to be aggressive right so that's what you're picking
[6651.66s -> 6656.62s]  Trist for is to get kills in lane the problem is is again what we were just talking about right
[6656.62s -> 6662.46s]  let's say I pick Trist to get kills in lane now let's say my uh my support doesn't want to be
[6662.46s -> 6667.74s]  aggressive. And let's say like the Jhin and the Karma have a really good push, okay? Something
[6667.74s -> 6673.02s]  that Trist is really weak at is being pushed in, right? That's one of her weakest things because
[6673.02s -> 6677.02s]  she struggles, especially early game, she struggles quite a bit on farming under turret.
[6678.14s -> 6686.22s]  So let's say it's just like a coin flippy pick. You could pick Trist if you had like a support duo,
[6686.22s -> 6691.34s]  for sure, into Jhin. Trist is amazing into Jhin. It's one of Jhin's hardest actual counters,
[6691.34s -> 6694.58s]  But again, it's not about countering the champion
[6694.58s -> 6698.62s]  It's about countering the lane and what the lane is going to do to you and being able to play around that
[6698.62s -> 6705.38s]  And this lane is a shove lane. Jhin and Karma doesn't fight you. They poke you and shove waves in. That's what they do
[6705.38s -> 6708.50s]  They're a prio lane. So they're just gonna shove and shove and shove, right?
[6708.78s -> 6710.90s]  So because they're just gonna shove and shove and shove
[6710.90s -> 6715.96s]  I need to play something that isn't gonna have issues playing under turret or something that can shove back if I need to
[6717.06s -> 6719.86s]  Right, which is why Jinx Aphelios are both good
[6719.86s -> 6726.56s]  Ezreal again would just get shoved in stuff like that, right?
[6726.56s -> 6730.16s]  Yeah, these are things you actually have to think about when you're playing the game for certain
[6730.96s -> 6732.16s]  champions
[6732.16s -> 6734.84s]  and certain matchups because a lot of the time
[6735.40s -> 6740.12s]  People will pick a champion that's meta and they won't understand why they're still losing the matchup
[6740.12s -> 6745.68s]  Even though they're good at that champion and it's just that you're not bad at the champ. The matchup is just unplayable
[6745.96s -> 6747.96s]  You could put Faker
[6747.96s -> 6753.20s]  Doublelift, fucking Gumiasi in certain matchups, and they will just lose. They will lose the matchups.
[6753.20s -> 6759.22s]  And it's because no matter how good your mechanics are, if the matchup is played correctly, it doesn't- it's not winnable.
[6759.22s -> 6763.86s]  And that's why you see in pro play, drafting is so important.
[6763.86s -> 6767.48s]  It's a perfect example of why in pro play, drafting is ten times more important than solo queue.
[6767.48s -> 6770.80s]  And it's because when everybody plays the matchups correctly and shit, right?
[6771.30s -> 6774.67s]  When everybody's playing the matchups correctly and shits,
[6775.81s -> 6779.25s]  the matchup, like, skill becomes a thousand times more important.
[6780.71s -> 6785.19s]  Or like, you know how the matchups being played like the champions become way more important
[6785.99s -> 6787.99s]  Whoa, what the fuck?
[6788.15s -> 6790.15s]  My monitor just fucked up. What the hell is going on?
[6794.55s -> 6798.87s]  Uh another little tip for you guys. Oh, I fucked that but another little tip for you guys is
[6801.67s -> 6803.27s]  melee champions
[6803.27s -> 6810.94s]  or melee minions take
[6811.02s -> 6814.39s]  one turret shot two autos
[6814.39s -> 6817.75s]  Or sorry, two turret shots one auto and casters take one auto one turret shot
[6819.59s -> 6821.91s]  When you're under turrets like look, okay, so
[6823.19s -> 6826.91s]  Learning this would be actually a pretty game to explain to you how to farm under the turn actually I
[6827.47s -> 6830.87s]  Was thinking about like what I could teach you guys cuz we're just gonna get shoved in a lot this game
[6832.43s -> 6840.10s]  It's actually not that bad though
[6840.12s -> 6842.68s]  So right now we could actually space forward here
[6843.92s -> 6846.42s]  Okay, that did not hit me. That was BS. But sure I
[6856.55s -> 6859.37s]  Did the same thing I did last game man. I
[6860.71s -> 6862.87s]  Did the same thing you said I walked up
[6862.87s -> 6868.59s]  It wasn't it was a good fight, but again, I keep doing that
[6868.59s -> 6872.19s]  We're like I see the fight and I'll take the fight because I know it's a good fight
[6873.03s -> 6879.02s]  But Lulu was too far back. So I ended up just inting. It's really stupid
[6881.49s -> 6899.54s]  okay, it was such a dumb play by me because I had to blow both my sums right there because
[6900.98s -> 6905.42s]  The Jhin or I mean the Jhin was in a really bad spot and the Karma was in a really bad spot because I was level
[6905.42s -> 6908.00s]  Three and they were level two and they were walking up to contest waves
[6908.82s -> 6909.90s]  but
[6909.90s -> 6916.62s]  My Lulu is behind me and when you're playing, you know solo queue you have to play as a team with your teammate
[6917.42s -> 6919.42s]  Okay, so this Jin is kind of griefing right now
[6925.70s -> 6936.84s]  He's griefing by like walking up when I'm blue gunning him. I don't know what Lulu's doing. I'm just killing that guy nice
[6936.84s -> 6940.70s]  Yeah, they're they're griefing really hard. So the blue guns OP for what you just saw
[6941.26s -> 6945.68s]  All you have to do with the blue gun if you really want to just like have a funny ass overpowered fucking
[6947.02s -> 6949.02s]  When they're farming under the turret like that
[6949.02s -> 6968.22s]  Just hit the minions. Okay, we're getting ganked. Let's back up. So I kind of did a
[6968.22s -> 6973.38s]  cardinal sin there I would say like a sin of like I overstayed a bit I think.
[6973.38s -> 6981.10s]  Oh okay well fuck off dude. That was greedy. I should have backed out the turret but I
[6981.10s -> 6984.42s]  didn't think Karma was actually gonna do that but I did overstay because you can
[6984.42s -> 6987.46s]  see like this is the perfect example of why I overstayed. So they stopped my back
[6987.46s -> 6994.50s]  right? I can give you guys a really good example of what just happened. I overstayed and when I
[6994.50s -> 6999.14s]  overstayed I didn't actually get anything out of it like I got what you saw I just have extra gold
[6999.14s -> 7003.94s]  for nothing so now I just have extra gold right and because I have extra gold the Jhin actually
[7003.94s -> 7009.06s]  gets a net positive because they stopped my back so he gets a free plate here I miss a cannon and
[7009.06s -> 7014.82s]  even though I'm still up 10 cs it's like I could have been up 10 cs not given a plate and not
[7014.82s -> 7023.34s]  missed a cannon so it's it's basically like it's interesting should you get
[7023.34s -> 7030.20s]  prio for your jungler every game no no that's not important some games
[7030.20s -> 7034.92s]  prio is important it's very important some games but you don't need to always
[7034.92s -> 7038.76s]  be thinking about getting prio for your jungler that's not something you should
[7038.76s -> 7041.80s]  be like thinking about like always right like you think about it in terms of like
[7041.80s -> 7046.58s]  timers that's important but prio for jungler always is not like something you
[7046.58s -> 7056.68s]  should be worrying about because if you're perma shoving and you're like, Oh, I have
[7056.68s -> 7061.32s]  prio for my jungler, but then your jungler doesn't do anything like having that prio
[7061.32s -> 7067.81s]  if you don't have pride, it doesn't do anything. Like I'd rather hold the wave in like a certain
[7067.81s -> 7105.84s]  spot. Oh my God, I suck. I mean, it worked out. I think if I was six, I triple killed
[7105.84s -> 7113.22s]  them there. But I think we actually, I think we actually triple killed him too if Lulu
[7113.22s -> 7160.44s]  helped me. But again, you guys know what I'm going to say. I go back to the thing. I don't
[7160.44s -> 7183.45s]  know if Rengar has ulti or not. I want to shove this because, uh, chill. I want to shove it
[7183.45s -> 7187.49s]  in for a second. And I really don't have anything to do. So I'll just stand here. You want to
[7187.49s -> 7193.25s]  also be backed once it's hit for when to buy boots. I bought boots. Aphelios, you can buy
[7193.25s -> 7199.01s]  boots really early. He's like he's a champion where the more attacks you do is actually very valuable
[7199.01s -> 7204.29s]  and positioning on Aphelios is very important. It's kind of like um some ad carries like you
[7204.29s -> 7208.77s]  don't need boots really early like like with like Jinx for example I usually go free boots
[7208.77s -> 7217.09s]  right or I go boots like after my Kraken but with Aphelios uh I really like the early mobility the
[7217.09s -> 7227.49s]  early trading stuff like that. Okay so always be watching the map too we see that Rengar's
[7227.49s -> 7238.94s]  top right we can actually just straight fight these guys 2v2 right now uh what wait what
[7241.15s -> 7245.79s]  what's my lulu doing homie what what are we he's ulting us
[7257.01s -> 7271.46s]  so you're saying helping the ad carry is bad got it i can't believe my lulu just walked away from me
[7271.46s -> 7278.64s]  and just like watch like you work as a team this is something that I cannot
[7278.64s -> 7287.79s]  stress enough play as a team when you play League of Legends this tilts me
[7287.79s -> 7292.51s]  more than anything because this happens even in grandmaster I see teammates who
[7292.51s -> 7298.87s]  will be selfish and not help each other just help each other help each other
[7298.87s -> 7300.87s]  Please man, we are a team
[7303.59s -> 7306.67s]  Don't just run and leave your ADC
[7307.47s -> 7312.23s]  Like I'm not even flaming you but like dude, you can't do that
[7313.29s -> 7318.89s]  You can't be upset that like like I can't dodge every spell. Welcome to the league
[7318.89s -> 7325.25s]  I feel like something that I noticed that happens a lot in League nowadays is players will have this weirdly high
[7325.85s -> 7329.57s]  expectation for everyone to play absolutely perfect at all times and
[7330.53s -> 7333.65s]  And they want me to like, beat Gumiasi.
[7333.65s -> 7337.07s]  And I'm like, dude, I dodged two of the Jhin bullets,
[7337.07s -> 7338.77s]  I dodged a Karma Q,
[7339.53s -> 7343.21s]  Like, you literally, like, I can't dodge literally everything while slowed, right?
[7343.21s -> 7344.85s]  Like, that's not how it works.
[7352.68s -> 7355.88s]  Like, dude, I'm gonna lose my mind with this guy.
[7385.01s -> 7386.37s]  My Lulu
[7386.77s -> 7393.05s]  is blaming me. It's okay.
[7394.98s -> 7397.78s]  It's okay. I don't need to be upset.
[7398.40s -> 7399.40s]  It's fine.
[7399.40s -> 7409.06s]  The Lulu player is totally okay.
[7409.06s -> 7412.52s]  You know, sometimes people think they're right.
[7412.52s -> 7424.71s]  It's just what happens in the worlds, right?
[7424.71s -> 7427.81s]  It's just, it is what it is.
[7427.81s -> 7428.81s]  No big deal.
[7428.81s -> 7442.70s]  Sorry.
[7442.70s -> 7445.94s]  I'm trying really hard to not be an asshole right now.
[7445.94s -> 7450.46s]  This Lulu player is making me like, making me want to like fund Thanos.
[7450.46s -> 7451.46s]  You know what I mean?
[7451.46s -> 7458.98s]  like making me like this guy like we talk about we like in league we talk about like the players
[7459.94s -> 7467.54s]  like we talk about ad carry players having ego i genuinely think support players have five times
[7467.54s -> 7476.70s]  the ego ad carry players have but with like a third of the skill i think ad carry players do
[7476.70s -> 7485.22s]  have massive egos but again i don't think that like i think support players are genuinely the
[7485.22s -> 7489.70s]  dumbest motherfucking humans on the planet and they think that they're the best players
[7489.70s -> 7520.02s]  to ever touch the game and it hurts my fucking balls. Hey Lulu, would you be willing to have a
[7521.54s -> 7528.90s]  VOD review with me in discord after the game? Let's just see. I want to see if like this person
[7528.90s -> 7559.53s]  is willing to listen to Reason. Let's see. I'm trying to not tilt but it's really frustrating.
[7560.09s -> 7567.09s]  Cause this player is playing specifically for KDA and they're playing like they don't
[7567.09s -> 7572.05s]  understand how- like I can already tell you if I go look at this person's OP.GG they
[7572.05s -> 7573.17s]  only play for KDA.
[7573.17s -> 7579.13s]  I can tell you right now, right here, this person plays only for KDA, never takes any
[7579.13s -> 7584.77s]  risks, doesn't ever help their ADC ever when they get behind, doesn't ever walk up to like
[7584.77s -> 7586.69s]  try and fight, doesn't do any of that.
[7586.69s -> 7590.97s]  I can tell you right now, without even looking at their OP.GG, from how this person plays,
[7590.97s -> 7598.70s]  that they have high KDAs, but really low winrate.
[7598.70s -> 7601.32s]  But I don't want my entire stream to be me bitching about this Lulu, so we'll try and
[7601.32s -> 7603.10s]  focus on how to win from this position.
[7603.10s -> 7605.90s]  Because I'm sure you guys get shitty supports too.
[7605.90s -> 7620.25s]  So we'll try and focus on how to win from the current position we're in.
[7620.25s -> 7621.25s]  Yeah it doesn't get better.
[7621.25s -> 7625.61s]  I mean, I'll be honest with you, my Grandmaster supports on my main suck.
[7625.61s -> 7627.69s]  Like, it doesn't get better.
[7627.69s -> 7630.61s]  They get better like mechanically at the game, right?
[7630.61s -> 7636.37s]  the higher elo supports get better mechanically but they get worse they don't get better when like
[7637.49s -> 7640.69s]  it doesn't get better it's always like you'll either have a really good support or you have
[7640.69s -> 7678.56s]  somebody who sniffs glue i'm just dead or i'm not dead okay uh honestly our biggest issue here is
[7678.56s -> 7693.34s]  i need to get bloodthirster asap once i get bt the game gets a lot easier we could kill this guy
[7693.34s -> 7697.18s]  right now if the Lulu helps me we can actually just straight kill these guys
[7698.30s -> 7702.70s]  because I can ulti to heal myself right we have Lulu ult I have ult to heal myself
[7702.70s -> 7707.90s]  and I'm strong she has ignite I have ult I have everything we could easily
[7709.74s -> 7716.86s]  kill that that Taliyah right there I mean yeah whatever man this is what I'm talking about
[7716.86s -> 7738.00s]  once. Again, are you willing to get into Discord and VOD review? Yes or no? I mean, I have
[7738.00s -> 7744.64s]  to be honest with you. The reason this is frustrating is because as an AD Carry player,
[7744.64s -> 7749.52s]  you want to be able to rely on your support, right? You want to be able to make plays,
[7749.52s -> 7753.68s]  go in, fight, and rely on your teammates. Because as an AD Carry player, support and
[7753.68s -> 7759.52s]  AD are like a duo, right? Like you want to play together. No, no man, I'm not attacking
[7759.52s -> 7763.08s]  I'm saying let's discord after
[7764.16s -> 7777.44s]  You can explain your POV and I'll explain mine. Maybe we can like improve this player
[7778.38s -> 7782.12s]  Like get them to be a better player and not ruin every game they play in
[7782.58s -> 7786.02s]  Like that would be that would be the goat
[7790.76s -> 7794.64s]  like the app that did not hit me by the way that hitbox is BS, but I
[7804.32s -> 7809.48s]  Don't even understand. Oh
[7810.20s -> 7811.36s]  man
[7811.36s -> 7818.64s]  This is the person's
[7821.49s -> 7824.13s]  By the way, this is the person who's op.gg
[7824.81s -> 7828.17s]  Average win rate, 50% win rate like I said
[7828.17s -> 7830.85s]  Has really good KDA's on all his champs
[7831.81s -> 7836.35s]  But he doesn't win. I'm telling you right now
[7836.79s -> 7839.53s]  The biggest thing in League, the
[7839.53s -> 7841.59s]  Fakest thing in League of Legends
[7841.67s -> 7845.05s]  Is believing that you are a good player based on KDA
[7846.17s -> 7849.73s]  If I go look at any challenger level support player right now
[7849.97s -> 7851.83s]  Their KDA's will be like
[7851.83s -> 7861.45s]  They'll still have good KDA but it'll be like 4 and 3 and it'll be on, that's your mutual?
[7861.45s -> 7867.81s]  I'm gonna be real with you right now T. This Lulu player, like you could tell me that this
[7867.81s -> 7872.73s]  person sniffed glue as a kid and their parents never told them to stop and I would believe
[7872.73s -> 7878.97s]  you. I'm not even memeing, like I would say that makes sense. I mean like I said, I don't
[7878.97s -> 7882.89s]  I don't care if it's a girl a guy the e-girl thing is like that doesn't bother me, right?
[7882.89s -> 7887.49s]  Like like it could be a girl a guy a pigeon they could they could fucking they could
[7888.09s -> 7892.97s]  Relate as a fucking peanut in a in a fucking plane. I don't care about that at all
[7893.33s -> 7898.09s]  You don't mean like so that shit doesn't bother me at all
[7899.19s -> 7903.51s]  Like then be like I actually think it's stupid when people are like, oh, it's an e-girl e-guy
[7903.51s -> 7907.69s]  Like I think that's dumb as shit because that arguments so crap
[7907.69s -> 7911.73s]  Because like I don't give a shit if it's a guy or girl because like, you know what I mean?
[7911.73s -> 7915.05s]  I'm more upset at the fact that this person is delusional than anything
[7915.85s -> 7929.96s]  That's like what's tilting me here. I'm just gonna mute
[7930.58s -> 7935.44s]  We'll do one more game on this account after this game and I'm gonna mute from the start of the game for you guys
[7935.44s -> 7942.34s]  Okay
[7942.34s -> 7945.26s]  Dude, if he didn't actually get me into the wall there
[7945.26s -> 7949.50s]  I tried to walk forward so that I wouldn't get condemned in the wall. If he didn't stun me I kill him
[7950.38s -> 7952.38s]  That's annoying
[7952.38s -> 7955.86s]  That was actually such a good hitbox for him.
[7955.86s -> 7970.59s]  My bad.
[7970.59s -> 7971.59s]  Nice.
[7971.59s -> 7972.59s]  Huge shutdown.
[7972.59s -> 7973.59s]  Nice job.
[7973.59s -> 7976.27s]  If you're wondering why I'm even here, by the way, I'm actually, I'm not trolling.
[7976.27s -> 7979.51s]  I'm trying to get this turret because this gives me a lot of gold.
[7979.51s -> 7982.23s]  At the moment, I'm not actually worth that much gold.
[7982.23s -> 7983.33s]  There's nothing going on in the map.
[7983.33s -> 7984.83s]  There's no objective or anything like that.
[7984.83s -> 7985.83s]  Right?
[7985.83s -> 7990.31s]  So I'm trying to push in top waves right now so that I can get gold to try and like
[7990.31s -> 7993.53s]  hyper inflate my two item before this next dragon.
[7993.53s -> 7995.29s]  this next Dragon's gonna be incredibly important
[7995.29s -> 7997.27s]  if we want any chance to win.
[7998.21s -> 7999.71s]  We have to win this next Dragon.
[8000.21s -> 8002.37s]  And the only way for me to do that is to either
[8002.37s -> 8003.75s]  get really lucky,
[8004.87s -> 8006.73s]  or go get some gold in a side lane.
[8007.69s -> 8009.49s]  It's just support difference every game.
[8009.49s -> 8010.45s]  It is.
[8010.81s -> 8012.11s]  I want to point this out.
[8012.11s -> 8015.29s]  This person is playing this victim complex bullshit.
[8015.29s -> 8017.13s]  Like, you know what I mean? But it is.
[8017.13s -> 8018.47s]  It is actually support diff.
[8018.87s -> 8056.99s]  Sorry. I'm tilted. I'm playing bad this game.
[8056.99s -> 8061.71s]  I need to mute these players because these players are actually tilting me
[8063.09s -> 8066.85s]  Like I was fine with it before but I'm actually getting a little irritated that's make me play bad
[8067.67s -> 8069.99s]  So I need to mute them so I don't keep inting
[8072.13s -> 8074.75s]  Like it's affecting my gameplay and it's pissing me off
[8076.93s -> 8078.45s]  That's just my bad
[8078.45s -> 8087.71s]  T split. Are you here T?
[8088.55s -> 8090.83s]  Yo T message this Lulu. I
[8091.49s -> 8094.89s]  Mean this in the nicest way. I don't even want to be toxic. I
[8094.89s -> 8097.49s]  I genuinely want to use this for content
[8100.83s -> 8102.83s]  Like this guy's been flaming me the whole game
[8103.15s -> 8109.11s]  Like I want to use this for content to show you guys that it is so easy to tell people how the game should be
[8109.11s -> 8113.23s]  Played so easy if you if you can communicate by talking
[8116.77s -> 8120.43s]  Because this guy's been doing nothing but flaming me the entire game this Lulu, right?
[8120.53s -> 8127.51s]  But he's an absolute like he played the lane completely bad then he then he stopped trying to win
[8127.51s -> 8130.43s]  and stop shielding me, stop doing anything, right?
[8130.43s -> 8133.93s]  After he played the lane bad.
[8133.93s -> 8135.43s]  Then he started playing the victim thing
[8135.43s -> 8136.57s]  when I asked him to be a human
[8136.57s -> 8138.93s]  and like come over and like help me and play teamwork.
[8138.93s -> 8141.57s]  You gotta remember, I didn't flame him a single time, right?
[8141.57s -> 8143.01s]  Like I didn't say a single negative thing
[8143.01s -> 8143.83s]  to this guy in game.
[8143.83s -> 8145.65s]  I said, let's work as a team.
[8145.65s -> 8146.49s]  He got upset.
[8150.87s -> 8152.73s]  Like, I genuinely think it'd be great content
[8152.73s -> 8154.85s]  if I could talk to this guy on Discord
[8154.85s -> 8173.98s]  and just like, oh, it'd be so good.
[8173.98s -> 8179.56s]  Like, dude, I'm trying to kill these people, guys.
[8179.56s -> 8182.00s]  That wasn't bad though, we got 800 gold.
[8182.00s -> 8185.40s]  Not the worst, but I don't know if my team can stall this.
[8185.40s -> 8187.16s]  Maybe if they can like kill this, they can stall it,
[8187.16s -> 8194.18s]  but nah, yeah, that's GG.
[8194.18s -> 8196.12s]  That was a disgusting Taliyah W.
[8234.34s -> 8236.88s]  All right, I'm gonna add him and he'll probably not add me,
[8236.88s -> 8241.21s]  but I might as well try.
[8241.21s -> 8252.25s]  This would be such a good learning experience.
[8252.25s -> 8253.65s]  Oh, excuse me.
[8253.65s -> 8255.37s]  Dude, I've had like bad heartburn today.
[8255.37s -> 8262.59s]  I need to take one of those heartburn pills.
[8262.59s -> 8263.61s]  What, Lulu?
[8263.61s -> 8265.61s]  What man, just say it, just let it out.
[8266.41s -> 8267.05s]  Let it out.
[8269.85s -> 8270.89s]  Let it out, baby.
[8271.45s -> 8271.95s]  Yo.
[8272.89s -> 8273.39s]  Lulu.
[8275.36s -> 8277.36s]  Let's just have a talk.
[8280.21s -> 8280.71s]  Yo.
[8281.49s -> 8282.21s]  Let's Discord.
[8283.69s -> 8284.89s]  We can bottom of you.
[8286.09s -> 8287.93s]  Since I'm so bad.
[8290.91s -> 8291.41s]  Yo.
[8297.55s -> 8298.05s]  Trust.
[8302.75s -> 8304.03s]  You just...
[8305.39s -> 8306.67s]  Blamed everyone...
[8307.31s -> 8308.03s]  But yourself.
[8308.95s -> 8310.95s]  But you didn't play correctly.
[8311.15s -> 8324.58s]  At all. You played lane completely wrong, didn't help each other, left people to die
[8324.58s -> 8366.36s]  on repeats, then played victim. I genuinely want to help you.
[8366.36s -> 8383.96s]  This guy screenshotted what I just said and put it in the end game chat. What is happening
[8383.96s -> 8392.36s]  right now what is going on there is no way that this is not an npc
[8399.88s -> 8405.48s]  there is no way this is not an npc there's no way
[8407.48s -> 8423.02s]  there's no way it's geronimo lamau it is me yes bro just come talk in discord i'm not even gonna
[8423.02s -> 8438.89s]  flame you what does this even mean bro i don't think i've seen anybody more insecure in my life
[8440.92s -> 8456.25s]  bro you are so insecure it's cringe how insecure you are like oof good luck man on the climb
[8456.25s -> 8475.34s]  I don't even know what to say, I'm going to be real, I'm not even going to flame the guy,
[8475.34s -> 8481.34s]  I just genuinely want to improve the community.
[8481.34s -> 8486.18s]  Because that was 3 straight supports in a row that didn't know how to play Lulu, and
[8486.18s -> 8490.30s]  I'm not even going to flame the guy's skill, he's not a Lulu player, he doesn't play Lulu,
[8490.30s -> 8497.26s]  fine but the issue was that i had with that guy specifically was that it's okay to be bad at the
[8497.26s -> 8503.02s]  game right there's nothing wrong with being bad at league everybody has bad games but when we're
[8503.02s -> 8507.18s]  playing a game together and you're saying it's winnable and you want to win the game you can't
[8507.18s -> 8514.22s]  pick and choose who to like help win the game like if i'm sitting there bot lane we're both
[8514.22s -> 8519.98s]  being dove by jhin and you're intentionally trying not to take damage and not die because
[8519.98s -> 8526.62s]  you want to value your KDA over everything else so that i you know what hold on let me think about
[8526.62s -> 8534.38s]  this i think i figured this person out this person lives in delusion and i think i figured this out
[8534.38s -> 8538.14s]  let me let me explain this a lot of players do this but i think i'm figuring this out as i'm as
[8538.14s -> 8545.26s]  i'm thinking about this so this person has really good KDAs on their profile right this like this
[8545.26s -> 8548.30s]  eye-catching person. They have really really good KDAs in their profile, right?
[8549.34s -> 8555.98s]  This person doesn't ever take risks, doesn't ever do anything to try and win the game outside of
[8555.98s -> 8563.80s]  like just the existing and hitting buttons, and what they do is they will always have good KDAs,
[8564.68s -> 8569.16s]  and they will they will sit here and never- like I know why they're losing. They will sit here and
[8569.16s -> 8573.32s]  they will do this shit where they have good KDAs, they don't ever die that much, blah blah blah,
[8573.32s -> 8578.56s]  But what they do is they lie to themselves and they say look how good my KDAs are
[8579.04s -> 8585.44s]  If I had better teammates, I'd always win like I
[8586.24s -> 8588.24s]  Cracked the code actually
[8588.64s -> 8592.06s]  That's totally what it is. The players actually like
[8592.58s -> 8596.44s]  Play so safe and they play to like for statistics, right?
[8596.52s -> 8603.08s]  They play like purely for the stats and then they can say that it was their team's fault that they didn't win
[8603.46s -> 8605.20s]  Because they played
[8605.20s -> 8616.82s]  Really bad, but they didn't die because I mean in theory I could have a perfect KDA on every ad carry I play
[8617.34s -> 8623.42s]  Right. All I'd have to do is literally walk walk up get one kill and then afk and stand at the base the rest of
[8623.42s -> 8628.10s]  The game and I could be like yo, why is my team not able to carry what's happening?
[8631.13s -> 8636.43s]  Right, but you can literally do that. No, I I seriously think the person's self gaslighting himself
[8637.65s -> 8643.21s]  Like I'm serious. I think this person's like self gaslighting where they're like, oh, it's my team's fault every game
[8643.49s -> 8649.41s]  Right, like they're always blaming their team for their their their loses and their mistakes and shits and it's sad because like
[8649.97s -> 8653.13s]  There's a reason you're d2 and I'm not saying that to be toxic
[8653.13s -> 8655.29s]  I'm saying that like you haven't improved in four years
[8655.29s -> 8659.29s]  And you haven't improved because all you're doing is playing to blame your team every single game
[8659.43s -> 8664.37s]  When I just saw like 500 mistakes that you made that we could have won the game off of early game
[8671.28s -> 8676.56s]  Here, I remember somebody wanted me to play a Kaitlin game last game. So we're gonna play Kate. I
[8676.56s -> 8680.84s]  I don't remember. I don't remember who it was in the chat. Somebody's like two people said Kate
[8681.36s -> 8683.36s]  But we'll do a cake game for you guys. I
[8684.16s -> 8703.93s]  Got you boys. Don't worry. All right, I'm gonna take
[8704.73s -> 8710.41s]  Ghost flash because they have three melee champs for melee champs. They have they have for Khan said clad Greg us
[8710.41s -> 8712.41s]  So I'm gonna take ghost flash
[8713.01s -> 8714.81s]  These are gonna be my runes this game
[8714.81s -> 8718.13s]  I'm gonna take a little more mr because I don't think we're gonna be fighting too much in lane
[8718.33s -> 8721.49s]  We're pretty much just gonna be poking them with karma Kate
[8721.49s -> 8724.89s]  So I'm going to take a little bit of extra MR because I'm going to be playing for mid
[8724.89s -> 8725.89s]  to late game.
[8725.89s -> 8726.89s]  I'm just scaling.
[8726.89s -> 8737.53s]  And these are going to be the runes that I take.
[8737.53s -> 8741.25s]  You can class on AD carry or the easier to play ones in AD carry.
[8741.25s -> 8744.81s]  I usually do like when I'm playing on this account right now, this is like my teaching
[8744.81s -> 8746.45s]  account.
[8746.45s -> 8747.45s]  It's a little lower MMR, right?
[8747.45s -> 8749.33s]  It's like D1 low masters.
[8749.33s -> 8754.97s]  I usually play AD carries that like the chat wants to see me play so that you guys can
[8754.97s -> 8759.97s]  learn like good and bad matchups and things like that the last two games I
[8759.97s -> 8764.89s]  got way too tilted by shitty support players like egos and all that shit I
[8764.89s -> 8768.61s]  got way too frustrated and I played bad the last two games so we're gonna
[8768.61s -> 8771.29s]  honestly I'm just gonna I think I'm just gonna mute these people at the very
[8771.29s -> 8775.25s]  start of the game normally I wouldn't suggest you meet people because like
[8775.25s -> 8779.65s]  playing as a team is really important because like you know you need to
[8779.65s -> 8784.41s]  communicate and all that shit but I am just like I'm gonna mute them because I
[8784.41s -> 8785.77s]  I
[8785.77s -> 8789.85s]  Dude, my mental is taking a fucking hit right now. So we're gonna just chill and play. I
[8793.59s -> 8798.55s]  Just don't know how to play Nyla. I think Nyla is really good. I just don't know how to play her. I
[8799.83s -> 8806.44s]  Think she's a great champ. Like I've been getting shit on by Nyla on my main account
[8807.76s -> 8822.56s]  Like a lot of grandmaster Nyla's have been dumpstering me. I think she's just really good at abusing solo queue
[8823.52s -> 8825.52s]  like the the issue with Nyla is
[8825.88s -> 8828.32s]  From what I've seen all the losses I've had with Nyla
[8829.16s -> 8832.44s]  People don't, um, it's like the thing I was telling you about before
[8832.84s -> 8836.44s]  People don't play aggressively in the lower elos
[8836.44s -> 8839.48s]  Like, even in Grandmaster, people don't play like aggressively enough
[8839.48s -> 8841.48s]  It sounds crazy to say that, but it's true
[8841.48s -> 8843.24s]  They don't play aggressively enough in lane
[8843.24s -> 8846.28s]  So you can get away with just picking Nyla and scaling
[8846.28s -> 8849.64s]  And Nyla, at like one item, you'll always be up in levels, right?
[8849.64s -> 8851.24s]  Because that's how the champion works
[8852.20s -> 8856.04s]  The champion works, and like, you'll always be up in levels because of her passive, so
[8856.04s -> 8862.72s]  You basically just like scale through existing. It's pretty it's pretty interesting
[8864.12s -> 8870.29s]  All right, so we're playing Kate karma. Oh, I missed the minion cuz I suck
[8871.37s -> 8873.37s]  I'm gonna ward this bush
[8874.49s -> 8876.49s]  Just because I don't want the recon in the bush
[8877.05s -> 8885.74s]  So now that the bush isn't ward anymore
[8886.34s -> 8892.80s]  Okay, what are the nice I was gonna say what I want to do is I actually want to play I suck
[8892.80s -> 8895.66s]  I actually wanted to play home, and I'm so bad at Kate
[8895.66s -> 8900.46s]  I wanted to play on the top side of the wave so that I'm not standing near the bushes, right?
[8900.98s -> 8902.98s]  Because if you stand near the bushes
[8903.78s -> 8908.26s]  The Rakan can obviously like W me and I just get fucked. So I'd rather play in a safer spot
[8909.50s -> 8911.50s]  Can't believe I missed two CS. I'm so fucking bad
[8912.36s -> 8916.64s]  Now I want to push in wave three and I want to go buy a cull. So I'm gonna ping to push
[8925.38s -> 8927.02s]  Okay
[8927.02s -> 8931.82s]  So I actually want to back here and I'm gonna go buy a cull. So this is called a cheater recall
[8931.82s -> 8940.82s]  Now, you usually have perfect CS to back on this timer, and you can go buy a cull.
[8940.82s -> 8944.96s]  This is like something that you can do if you're in a lane that's going to be perma-shoving.
[8944.96s -> 8948.78s]  So what happens is the reason it's called the cheater recall is because we push the
[8948.78s -> 8952.78s]  wave in, they had to stay and farm the wave.
[8952.78s -> 8958.43s]  Now watch, they have to push this wave in.
[8958.43s -> 8962.03s]  Now if Karma was here instead of roaming, this roam is fine by the way, but if she
[8962.03s -> 8967.79s]  here instead of roaming she could actually hold the wave and if you notice here i don't actually
[8967.79s -> 8978.27s]  miss that many minions right we're chilling now we can slow push this we're safe i should actually
[8978.27s -> 8984.35s]  fast push this because i want it to bounce i don't want to slow push this but i i can't uh i
[8984.35s -> 8996.27s]  can't fast push this at level three by myself so we're just gonna chill hayden's really good at
[8996.27s -> 9002.79s]  Abusing like early lane phase bullying just based on like what our kit does. We see Rakan on the map top side
[9002.79s -> 9004.47s]  Did you guys see that?
[9004.47s -> 9011.13s]  So because we see Rakan I can walk up a bit and we can play a little aggro here
[9011.49s -> 9022.48s]  You can kind of see like I don't have to play behind the minion wave. You see what I'm doing to this guy, right?
[9023.48s -> 9034.05s]  I hate this game. We can quit. We can forfeit. It's fine. I hate this game. I really hate this game
[9034.73s -> 9037.77s]  Dude, what is wrong with me right now? It's like my brain doesn't work
[9040.70s -> 9042.70s]  It's the 280 Cait nerf, I'm telling you.
[9047.52s -> 9049.52s]  So, Rakan's gonna be bot right now.
[9051.02s -> 9052.02s]  I know he's gonna be bot.
[9052.52s -> 9054.02s]  Uh, so I need to be a little care.
[9055.02s -> 9056.52s]  Now my Karma is here.
[9059.23s -> 9059.73s]  There we go.
[9059.73s -> 9061.23s]  So, you notice I didn't use any spells.
[9061.23s -> 9062.73s]  I'm not- I'm just chillin'.
[9065.82s -> 9066.82s]  Dude.
[9067.32s -> 9068.82s]  Are you kidding me, man?
[9071.02s -> 9072.02s]  I'm gonna be honest.
[9072.02s -> 9074.52s]  I'm getting really tilted by these players now.
[9075.02s -> 9076.52s]  Like, the Rakan W's in.
[9077.52s -> 9080.52s]  They just stand there and watch me die.
[9081.52s -> 9085.60s]  Okay, it's fine. Listen, I'm not gonna get too mad about it. It's fine. I should have flashed the knock up
[9085.84s -> 9089.20s]  I guess even though in reality, I should never have to flash the knock up
[9089.68s -> 9092.24s]  But I I should have flashed it because I can't trust the teammates
[9092.72s -> 9096.72s]  So what i'm saying is right there karma and fiddle were both right here. I was being chased down
[9097.20s -> 9101.52s]  They they stood here. They didn't they didn't walk up to do anything. They just stood and waited
[9102.88s -> 9105.44s]  That pisses me off because I hate when players
[9106.64s -> 9108.40s]  play
[9108.40s -> 9115.41s]  Selfish and scared. It's my biggest pet peeve. It drives me fucking crazy, man
[9116.85s -> 9118.85s]  Sorry, i'm getting i'm losing my mind
[9122.80s -> 9126.46s]  Like it's so easy
[9126.46s -> 9142.66s]  It's fine though. I I shouldn't have walked up and egoed it. It's on me. I want to soul push this wave
[9148.83s -> 9154.59s]  Yeah, i'm losing it
[9154.59s -> 9158.03s]  This by the way would be an example of a bad time for karma to roam. She needs to come back bot
[9162.14s -> 9164.22s]  There's absolutely no reason for her to roam on that timer
[9165.26s -> 9168.54s]  There's also no reason for her to be in that bush over there. We should be playing up to try
[9168.54s -> 9172.70s]  We're playing kate karma, right? We should be playing forward so that we can actually be aggressive
[9173.82s -> 9176.78s]  Kate karma is a lane bully lane. We don't want to sit here and just do nothing
[9177.26s -> 9179.90s]  If you pick karma, you want to be aggressive. You want to be playing up?
[9179.90s -> 9182.94s]  You want to be stunning you want to be doing like aggressive things playing the game
[9186.37s -> 9188.93s]  We're level six. I'd really like to like go in. Yeah, like
[9196.93s -> 9201.33s]  That was actually not bad by the karma. She w'd the xayah and then I got to trap off of it
[9201.33s -> 9203.33s]  So that wasn't too bad
[9203.49s -> 9224.22s]  Not the worst not not bad. That was good. That was good
[9225.74s -> 9226.58s]  Really nice, really nice.
[9226.58s -> 9227.64s]  Okay, so I'm gonna back here
[9227.64s -> 9243.27s]  because I don't want to overstay for the wave.
[9243.27s -> 9244.27s]  I'm gonna grab boots.
[9248.10s -> 9250.74s]  You know what I think a lot of it is too?
[9250.74s -> 9252.78s]  I think a lot of it is people get really scared
[9252.78s -> 9254.98s]  when they, like Rakan is really strong in this meta, right?
[9254.98s -> 9256.38s]  Like he's very, very powerful.
[9256.38s -> 9258.58s]  He's like numbers are a little too high right now.
[9258.58s -> 9261.10s]  So like everything he does is just a little too good.
[9261.10s -> 9262.78s]  So I think people get nervous around Rakan,
[9262.78s -> 9263.86s]  especially with Xayah,
[9263.86s -> 9265.46s]  because it's like when people would get nervous
[9265.46s -> 9266.66s]  around Nami-Lucian.
[9266.66s -> 9268.54s]  The lane like plays itself, it's very strong.
[9268.54s -> 9269.90s]  It's very hard to beat,
[9269.90s -> 9271.74s]  but you can still see people making mistakes
[9271.74s -> 9272.58s]  when they play the lane,
[9272.58s -> 9280.33s]  so you gotta watch for that type of stuff.
[9280.33s -> 9287.81s]  Now, a good way to play against a Xayah when she hits six
[9287.81s -> 9289.97s]  is you don't want to,
[9291.49s -> 9294.05s]  you don't wanna ever walk melee range of her
[9294.05s -> 9297.01s]  or give her the ability to just kill you with the feathers.
[9297.01s -> 9299.21s]  Your main goal here is gonna be
[9299.21s -> 9302.69s]  try and stay in a good spot when it comes to feathers.
[9302.69s -> 9304.77s]  Like, I wanna be to the side of her.
[9304.77s -> 9306.25s]  The side of her is the best option,
[9306.25s -> 9307.45s]  like where she can't pull in.
[9307.45s -> 9313.37s]  Like I'll get hit by maybe a few but she can't pull in all of them. That's a really
[9314.01s -> 9317.65s]  Key thing when playing versus her because I remember back in the day
[9317.65s -> 9320.29s]  I didn't know how to play Versailles and I would always get fucking frustrated this shit
[9320.97s -> 9323.89s]  So Rakan's five. I want to hit tab see Rakan's five
[9324.99s -> 9326.81s]  We shouldn't be able to die here
[9326.81s -> 9333.95s]  I want to push this wave in but I also need to stay away from where the Rakan could be
[9334.45s -> 9338.20s]  So if you want to push waves in and reset the wave
[9338.20s -> 9343.96s]  Make sure that you're standing as far away as you can from where they can engage on you.
[9343.96s -> 9353.73s]  Now they're about to be 6, Rakan is. So they have a really strong level 6, she has pickaxe and noonquiver.
[9353.73s -> 9356.77s]  We do want to be a little hesitant here, we don't want to fight.
[9356.77s -> 9360.69s]  Now I'm gonna kind of push this in a bit.
[9360.69s -> 9365.01s]  We should have been spam pushing the whole wave, because that's how Kate Karma plays,
[9365.01s -> 9367.01s]  we just push, push, push, push.
[9367.01s -> 9372.01s]  But we played that early roam by Karma,
[9372.01s -> 9374.51s]  kinda put us behind on that.
[9374.51s -> 9376.37s]  It's not a big deal.
[9376.37s -> 9383.36s]  It's just something that we have to adjust.
[9383.36s -> 9388.32s]  Why does this say 88 and this say 90?
[9388.32s -> 9398.24s]  Which one is it?
[9398.24s -> 9407.69s]  Is it 88 or 90?
[9407.69s -> 9408.89s]  I mean, that guy's dead.
[9410.41s -> 9411.73s]  I don't know what that Karma's thinking,
[9411.73s -> 9420.20s]  but we probably have to give this Drake.
[9420.20s -> 9422.28s]  I mean, maybe we could fight it if Fiddle had ulti,
[9422.28s -> 9431.28s]  but him not having ult, yeah, there's no way.
[9431.28s -> 9432.98s]  The higher one counts ward kills?
[9433.82s -> 9434.66s]  Why?
[9436.42s -> 9438.00s]  I think that's so stupid.
[9438.00s -> 9439.70s]  So they might try and engage here,
[9441.18s -> 9444.26s]  unless they somehow know Fiddles in the bush,
[9444.26s -> 9448.53s]  which would be impressive because we know it's not warded.
[9448.53s -> 9464.31s]  So that'd be pretty impressive if they knew that.
[9464.31s -> 9472.16s]  We could actually rift.
[9472.16s -> 9477.28s]  I'm just gonna ghost.
[9477.28s -> 9480.32s]  This is crazy, what the fuck?
[9480.32s -> 9486.30s]  Oh, this is interesting.
[9486.30s -> 9487.34s]  They soft fed 100%
[9487.34s -> 9488.46s]  Yeah, I don't know where though
[9488.46s -> 9488.96s]  It must've-
[9489.30s -> 9490.34s]  Cause he used his thing
[9491.98s -> 9493.98s]  Fiddle used his, uh, whatever it's called
[9496.00s -> 9496.72s]  His effigy
[9497.72s -> 9498.36s]  I'd have to go look
[9502.60s -> 9503.10s]  One minion
[9503.10s -> 9504.20s]  Oh, I guess I didn't see it
[9506.30s -> 9507.50s]  Uh, I should back
[9507.50s -> 9508.46s]  I can get dove here
[9508.98s -> 9509.86s]  We don't know where Gragas is
[9509.86s -> 9511.18s]  Like if Gragas happens to be like
[9511.18s -> 9512.62s]  He E's over this wall or something
[9513.34s -> 9514.78s]  I can get dove really easy
[9514.78s -> 9516.18s]  I'm greeting really hard
[9517.22s -> 9518.58s]  Greeting usually gets you killed
[9519.22s -> 9519.78s]  Typically
[9520.90s -> 9521.90s]  I shouldn't be doing this
[9524.30s -> 9527.58s]  They're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right?
[9528.46s -> 9530.14s]  It's like
[9530.14s -> 9532.62s]  If you know something's gonna be a bad habit, you should not do it
[9535.42s -> 9537.42s]  Just queue the bush
[9538.06s -> 9540.14s]  Okay, that was I meant use like an actual queue
[9543.34s -> 9546.22s]  They could also be in the alcove. So i'm a little hesitant, but it's fine
[9552.22s -> 9556.22s]  Okay. So the reason I stayed was because now I have my uh, I have my mythic, right?
[9557.18s -> 9561.02s]  Because we we finished the coal and we finished the mythic at the same time or finished the wave. So
[9561.02s -> 9568.22s]  Now I have two options, I can go Galeforce here to dodge a lot of their shits or I can
[9568.22s -> 9575.18s]  do what sounds like a fun option, we're going to do shield bow, I'm going to show you guys
[9575.18s -> 9581.90s]  why I like shield bow on Caitlyn, it's not the best mythic but it's good into certain
[9581.90s -> 9591.58s]  comps if you don't want to get Gale, because I have alacrity this game, I don't have bloodline
[9591.58s -> 9601.69s]  Right, so I kind of want to go shield bow and then I'm gonna end up going
[9602.49s -> 9604.49s]  Either ie or I'm gonna end up going
[9605.09s -> 9609.81s]  like bloodthirster seconds
[9609.85s -> 9611.85s]  ie or bt
[9612.17s -> 9614.17s]  probably ie just because I
[9615.33s -> 9626.56s]  Think I think it's actually easier to go ie this game. But yeah, this is a kind of boring game
[9626.56s -> 9637.96s]  Our team's doing really well though. So we just chill we got to be a little care
[9638.60s -> 9639.68s]  Okay
[9639.68s -> 9657.40s]  It was kind of hard to do anything there
[9657.68s -> 9659.68s]  Even though I got like a few autos on the Gragas
[9659.72s -> 9662.14s]  It's a little difficult to actually play the game there
[9662.56s -> 9670.74s]  Because if I walk up too far like see we're cons there if I walk up too far
[9670.74s -> 9677.05s]  I just get killed by recon. All right, I'm just gonna reset and go get boots
[9679.82s -> 9682.10s]  Typically ad carry is really fucking boring
[9682.86s -> 9684.86s]  in games like this
[9685.22s -> 9687.18s]  where
[9687.18s -> 9697.29s]  You can't really blow the game open. Oh, I'm dead. Maybe wait karma shield me. I'm not dead
[9697.43s -> 9700.64s]  Nice.
[9700.64s -> 9701.64s]  F**k!
[9701.64s -> 9702.64s]  Motherf**ker Kobe'd me man.
[9702.64s -> 9727.12s]  He was just like, Kobe!
[9727.12s -> 9734.69s]  We can fight this though, they have no ults.
[9734.69s -> 9741.99s]  Like this is actually fightable, they have no Xayah R and no Gragas R.
[9741.99s -> 9745.71s]  And this is also why it's really important that you relay to your team the cooldowns
[9745.71s -> 9746.71s]  of your team.
[9746.71s -> 9747.71s]  Remember that.
[9747.71s -> 9748.71s]  Don't forget that.
[9748.71s -> 9751.49s]  If somebody uses a big cooldown, tell your team.
[9751.49s -> 9755.09s]  Because that was an illegal dragon, right, like they just, that was one of the most
[9755.09s -> 9779.80s]  illegal things i've seen in a while homie completely griefed that that's another very very very important
[9779.80s -> 9783.72s]  thing that you need to take away from playing league and being like this is what i'm saying
[9783.72s -> 9789.80s]  about teamwork and shit earlier being good at the game is a lot of spreading knowledge as well right
[9791.16s -> 9795.40s]  like if you if your team doesn't know if a flash is up or down you have to play completely
[9795.40s -> 9798.84s]  differently right like you got to think about the game in that in terms of that as well like
[9798.84s -> 9801.60s]  Like how many times have you seen like, you know, you're like, oh,
[9801.60s -> 9804.24s]  I can walk up here if this guy can't flash ult me or something. Right.
[9808.33s -> 9814.96s]  It happens all the time. I wonder if I can kill a Duskblade Zed. I don't know.
[9820.39s -> 9832.28s]  I probably could. Uh, I should go mid.
[9835.53s -> 9838.41s]  What do you think about Teemo and other top lane as AD carry?
[9840.52s -> 9845.12s]  I play Teemo AD carry when I'm playing for fun sometimes. It's okay.
[9854.21s -> 9858.65s]  Yo, go look on your game, man. So during the mid game as Caitlyn, uh,
[9858.65s -> 9860.29s]  a few things that I can kind of teach you,
[9860.29s -> 9863.41s]  This was kind of a boring lane phase right like we didn't really do that much
[9863.97s -> 9869.09s]  The lane phase was essentially just like we died once and then you know everything all hell broke loose
[9870.13s -> 9872.13s]  When you're walking up to fights like this
[9872.69s -> 9874.93s]  Make sure that you're putting traps down in places
[9877.32s -> 9884.44s]  Where the enemy has to walk
[9884.44s -> 9885.88s]  just like that
[9885.88s -> 9890.04s]  Playing 80 playing caitlyn is not always about just like autoing and getting queues and shits
[9890.44s -> 9893.96s]  If you noticed during that fight, I put two traps here two traps here
[9893.96s -> 9900.83s]  I forced the enemy team into like a location where they had to eat traps or they
[9901.55s -> 9908.22s]  They can't find us right and even if like they avoid the traps
[9908.22s -> 9914.42s]  They're still having to like move their character in a very unique specific way that they probably don't want to do
[9914.86s -> 9921.25s]  So you should always be thinking where should I put these traps down at the start of a fight?
[9921.25s -> 9922.93s]  Not like how do I get autos off?
[9922.93s -> 9928.39s]  think about using your traps to zone and that I control the team fight before the fight starts rather than using it to
[9928.39s -> 9933.39s]  to do damage because they'll step in the traps themselves.
[9934.27s -> 9936.55s]  People will just, people are stupid.
[9936.55s -> 9937.39s]  They're bad.
[9937.39s -> 9938.67s]  People aren't paying attention.
[9938.67s -> 9939.51s]  Everything.
[9939.51s -> 9941.07s]  I'm bad.
[9941.07s -> 9941.91s]  You know what I mean?
[9941.91s -> 9943.33s]  People can't pay attention to every bush
[9943.33s -> 9945.51s]  that you're putting traps in during a big fight.
[9945.51s -> 9947.29s]  It's too much attention span.
[9947.29s -> 9961.89s]  Nobody has it.
[9961.89s -> 9964.38s]  Nice.
[9964.38s -> 9967.55s]  I'm gonna go grab this red.
[9967.55s -> 9969.85s]  Oh, big tip for all the AD carries in chat.
[9969.85s -> 9972.65s]  Guys, I'm gonna tell you right now,
[9972.65s -> 9975.25s]  Once the 20 minute mark happens in League,
[9975.25s -> 9977.29s]  your junglers camps are no longer his.
[9978.33s -> 9981.13s]  I know, I know junglers are gonna hate me for this, okay?
[9981.13s -> 9982.21s]  Listen, if you're a jungle player
[9982.21s -> 9983.81s]  and you're like, fuck this guy now, I hate him.
[9983.81s -> 9985.45s]  Listen, you know it's true.
[9985.45s -> 9988.49s]  You know at 20 minutes, your camps no longer,
[9988.49s -> 9991.05s]  like, they're not yours anymore, man, okay?
[9991.05s -> 9994.09s]  Like, you are full items at this point, okay?
[9994.09s -> 9995.57s]  Like, I wanna be honest.
[9996.73s -> 10000.46s]  I'm taking your camps.
[10000.46s -> 10001.70s]  I'm trying to get my third item
[10001.70s -> 10010.71s]  as fast as humanly possible.
[10010.71s -> 10021.19s]  because AD carries spike on three items extremely hard.
[10021.19s -> 10022.43s]  Man, I want to walk top,
[10022.43s -> 10023.83s]  but we have no vision of this area,
[10023.83s -> 10028.92s]  so it's a little scary.
[10028.92s -> 10031.68s]  Like I said, I typically don't like to take
[10031.68s -> 10034.36s]  jungles, camps, early game ever,
[10034.36s -> 10037.08s]  because like, that's why I say like at 20 minutes,
[10037.08s -> 10039.52s]  usually you have two items at this point.
[10039.52s -> 10042.40s]  If you're like farming decent and you know, et cetera.
[10042.40s -> 10043.36s]  Sometimes it'll be faster,
[10043.36s -> 10044.72s]  but usually it's around average
[10044.72s -> 10048.83s]  of like you'll have your items at this point.
[10048.83s -> 10050.65s]  Always be tabbing to the team fights,
[10050.65s -> 10073.52s]  even if you're farming as well.
[10073.52s -> 10079.72s]  Zed is in this bush.
[10079.72s -> 10080.56s]  Wait, where is he?
[10080.56s -> 10081.38s]  Wait, I'm stupid.
[10081.38s -> 10082.96s]  Where'd he go?
[10082.96s -> 10083.80s]  Oh, he died.
[10083.80s -> 10084.62s]  I killed him.
[10085.80s -> 10086.92s]  Wow, I'm really smart.
[10093.37s -> 10096.33s]  I like didn't notice that I killed that guy.
[10096.33s -> 10102.78s]  I'm so dumb.
[10102.78s -> 10107.72s]  AD carry brain, right boys?
[10107.72s -> 10109.36s]  I was like playing that so scared too.
[10109.36s -> 10111.56s]  Cause I was like, I was like, is he there?
[10121.38s -> 10122.44s]  Pull the dragon out.
[10124.28s -> 10125.12s]  Oh, I asked this yesterday,
[10125.12s -> 10127.40s]  but what do you guys think the coolest looking dragon is?
[10127.40s -> 10132.24s]  I swear it's the, I think Mountain Drake looks fucking sick.
[10168.92s -> 10172.12s]  So here you saw that I took the time to push mid, right?
[10173.80s -> 10178.88s]  That's mainly because our Karma just got picked off
[10178.88s -> 10181.32s]  and I don't want to give them the option
[10181.32s -> 10203.46s]  of pushing the wave, so by pushing the lane,
[10203.46s -> 10206.06s]  nice, by pushing the lane in,
[10206.06s -> 10208.54s]  it takes away an option for the enemy.
[10208.54s -> 10209.86s]  That's something that a lot of people think like,
[10209.86s -> 10210.74s]  oh, I just want farm.
[10210.74s -> 10212.06s]  I don't care about the farm, right?
[10212.06s -> 10217.54s]  Like when I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game, uh, and I'm pushing like a mid
[10217.54s -> 10222.98s]  mid wave in before a fight, if we're just sieging around the baron, having that wave
[10222.98s -> 10227.86s]  pushed in gives them, gives us another option on like what we can do in the game.
[10227.86s -> 10229.46s]  And it takes you three seconds to push it in.
[10229.46s -> 10236.30s]  So if the fight's already over and you have time, always be paying attention to like trying
[10236.30s -> 10240.70s]  to push in waves so that you can create a little bit of that pressure.
[10240.70s -> 10241.70s]  Yo, hail.
[10241.70s -> 10247.50s]  much for the 14 man welcome back what do I get next I kind of want to get BT I'm
[10247.50s -> 10255.75s]  gonna get BT I could get Dom's but I think BT is better because the I already
[10255.75s -> 10260.03s]  have overkill right so the shield from BT plus shield bow plus IE I don't think
[10260.03s -> 10264.59s]  I'll be able to die okay I think I'm unkillable act actually like actually
[10264.59s -> 10268.19s]  unkillable so here I'm gonna actually give these camps to Fiddle because he's
[10268.19s -> 10287.46s]  literally pathing to them I don't want to be an asshole but Wow what just
[10287.46s -> 10298.14s]  happened I'm bad I feel like I got hooked by Kled oh he flashed okay I was
[10298.14s -> 10301.50s]  like I feel like what just happened was like I mispositioned cuz like I went up
[10301.50s -> 10304.58s]  here right like I ghosted one up here cuz there was two people here two
[10304.58s -> 10308.34s]  people here I put traps down these kind of sloppy traps and then I positioned
[10308.34s -> 10311.94s]  here and then Kled flash queued me under that yeah okay that makes sense
[10311.94s -> 10322.63s]  I'm just bad it was okay though cuz if the entire enemy team has to literally
[10322.63s -> 10328.75s]  like double flash on you to kill you under the turret and then your team
[10328.75s -> 10332.27s]  follows up it's not that big of a deal Galeforce would have saved me there
[10332.27s -> 10342.16s]  though actually low-key Galeforce totally would save me cuz he has
[10342.16s -> 10349.31s]  serpents serpents definitely shits on Chilbo I'm kind of stupid for going
[10349.31s -> 10351.31s]  Show by this game. I
[10353.03s -> 10357.71s]  Wanted to try it out because I when I before when I was playing Kaitlyn like before the IE rework and everything
[10358.11s -> 10359.75s]  Everybody would go
[10359.75s -> 10363.57s]  Or there was like one guy in challenger would go shield bow into shit every game
[10363.75s -> 10368.57s]  And I wanted to see if like it was still viable, but there might just be better options now like always scale force
[10369.67s -> 10376.14s]  BT or something. Oh my god, I flashed late. I'm dead
[10376.84s -> 10382.51s]  Dude, I flashed late for some reason. I'm so dumb
[10382.51s -> 10384.51s]  My bad
[10385.55s -> 10387.27s]  I'll just give him an MB
[10387.27s -> 10389.27s]  Like my brain is moving slowly
[10389.99s -> 10391.99s]  Like I can feel it turning
[10392.67s -> 10394.67s]  I'm just playing bad
[10394.71s -> 10398.31s]  Like I I was baiting the Kled to go in on me cuz Karma was there
[10398.43s -> 10401.17s]  But what I need to do is I need to trap on top of myself when he goes in
[10401.75s -> 10408.12s]  Then I need to flash net and the Kled just dies. You can also just kill him
[10408.12s -> 10416.92s]  I was gonna say they have nothing we just play for dragon here. I
[10422.08s -> 10427.32s]  Don't know why I'm playing so bad today. I played bad yesterday, too. I don't know what's going on. My like brain is broken
[10444.97s -> 10446.97s]  Dude, there were con was trying so hard
[10459.57s -> 10490.39s]  Oh, I've made so many mistakes this game. I fucked up positioning mechanics farm
[10491.27s -> 10499.51s]  all kinds of shit, uh
[10499.51s -> 10509.81s]  I still don't want Lord Dom's actually. I don't think Lord Dom's is good this game
[10510.65s -> 10515.15s]  Like they have no armor like quite as Merc treads
[10516.89s -> 10518.89s]  Which I feel like
[10519.77s -> 10521.77s]  Really bad into our team but
[10530.96s -> 10533.26s]  Oh a little tip that you guys can have for Caitlyn too
[10533.92s -> 10535.92s]  when you are
[10536.00s -> 10538.00s]  Like Baron's up in 50 seconds, right?
[10538.00s -> 10543.40s]  so a little thing you can do that's actually kind of fun is you want to be at the objective before the like
[10543.40s -> 10546.40s]  Like rule of thumb, when an objective is coming up, you always want to be on that side of
[10546.40s -> 10549.76s]  the map before the objective comes up.
[10549.76s -> 10558.12s]  But you can put down traps in the bushes around the objectives and people will face check
[10558.12s -> 10561.68s]  them and you can just one tap them late game.
[10561.68s -> 10568.98s]  It's actually incredibly fun, but you just put them in the corners of the bushes where
[10568.98s -> 10576.20s]  people have to walk.
[10576.20s -> 10578.20s]  Like right here, I can put it right between the turret.
[10578.20s -> 10592.44s]  I don't know why I didn't ghost.
[10592.44s -> 10597.31s]  I'll be honest, I have no idea why I didn't ghost.
[10597.31s -> 10599.97s]  I was like saving it for something, I'm not sure what.
[10602.63s -> 10605.37s]  Next year, a birthday present, who the fuck knows?
[10609.36s -> 10611.98s]  Oh, I could've one-shot that guy if I was better at Cait.
[10613.14s -> 10615.10s]  I did a really classic combo right there,
[10615.10s -> 10618.74s]  I just didn't Q, cause I'm bad.
[10618.74s -> 10619.92s]  I should've, when he hit the trap,
[10619.92s -> 10621.84s]  your two headshots sit on him for a few seconds,
[10621.84s -> 10622.96s]  so what I should've done,
[10622.96s -> 10624.60s]  is I should've instantly Q'd on top of the trap,
[10624.60s -> 10626.52s]  then auto-auto'd and he would've died.
[10626.52s -> 10628.68s]  Cause your Q does the max damage when they're trapped too,
[10628.68s -> 10632.16s]  So it would have been like just a perfect three shot.
[10632.16s -> 10634.44s]  But like I said, I don't play Kayd enough
[10634.44s -> 10636.16s]  and my muscle memory is kind of trash sometimes.
[10636.16s -> 10650.00s]  So that was my bad.
[10650.00s -> 10651.40s]  Oh, we're getting cluttered.
[10652.32s -> 10674.97s]  I don't know where he is, but I shouldn't have done that.
[10674.97s -> 10677.43s]  I'm limit testing really hard right now.
[10677.43s -> 10678.99s]  I suggest you guys don't limit test.
[10678.99s -> 10680.75s]  Well, actually I do think you should limit test,
[10680.75s -> 10682.51s]  but not if you want to win, like play safer.
[10682.51s -> 10684.79s]  Like right there, the play wasn't to go back in.
[10684.79s -> 10686.11s]  The play was to like back off,
[10686.11s -> 10690.50s]  but I wanted to see if I could like,
[10690.50s -> 10692.54s]  I wanted to see if I was terrible or not.
[10693.70s -> 10695.28s]  You know?
[10695.28s -> 10696.12s]  I was.
[10697.70s -> 10699.46s]  But yeah, I mean, the combo with Cait is like,
[10699.46s -> 10700.78s]  if they're trapped,
[10700.78s -> 10703.58s]  you wanna Q while they're in the trap, essentially,
[10703.58s -> 10707.42s]  because your auto will always give you the range.
[10707.42s -> 10709.14s]  So if you auto and then Q,
[10711.52s -> 10713.54s]  when they're trapped, they get,
[10713.54s -> 10715.02s]  not a lot of people know this,
[10715.02s -> 10716.96s]  because I just found this out like a few years,
[10716.96s -> 10719.26s]  or like after I should have.
[10721.02s -> 10723.18s]  When you Q on top of a K-trap,
[10723.18s -> 10725.50s]  the way KSQ works is when you Q,
[10725.50s -> 10727.34s]  the initial, like it hits initially
[10727.34s -> 10730.52s]  and then it does less damage to the targets behind it, right?
[10730.52s -> 10732.62s]  It's very narrow and then it like gets bigger.
[10732.62s -> 10735.74s]  So when they're trapped though,
[10735.74s -> 10738.06s]  it does the maximum Q damage that it can do
[10738.06s -> 10739.92s]  in like the isolation of the Q.
[10739.92s -> 10741.78s]  So that's why when people are trapped,
[10741.78s -> 10745.45s]  you wanna open up with your Q.
[10745.45s -> 10747.75s]  You either wanna net into the Q
[10747.75s -> 10750.55s]  and then double auto, or you wanna net,
[10750.55s -> 10755.13s]  or you wanna Q, then trap net at the same time,
[10755.13s -> 10756.79s]  then double auto.
[10756.79s -> 10759.15s]  It's a very interesting way to play.
[10759.15s -> 10762.03s]  You always wanna try and overlay a trap on your trap.
[10762.03s -> 10765.71s]  So when they get trapped, you can overlay a second trap too,
[10765.71s -> 10767.71s]  either in front of them or behind them.
[10767.71s -> 10770.63s]  And what'll happen is there's actually a little mini,
[10770.63s -> 10772.91s]  I wanna say one second, cool down
[10772.91s -> 10773.99s]  of being able to be trapped, right?
[10773.99s -> 10776.31s]  Like a little 1.5, two second cool down.
[10776.31s -> 10778.15s]  But what can happen is that you sit in the trap,
[10778.15s -> 10780.23s]  then what you can do is your net can slow them.
[10780.23s -> 10783.03s]  So you can actually queue in the first trap,
[10783.03s -> 10784.91s]  then you can drop a second trap,
[10784.91s -> 10786.71s]  net slow them into the second trap,
[10786.71s -> 10788.19s]  and then triple auto headshot them
[10788.19s -> 10791.03s]  from all three of the two traps.
[10791.03s -> 10796.88s]  It's really complicated sounding,
[10796.88s -> 10806.61s]  but this man is redeemed end my stream whenever you want.
[10813.50s -> 10817.15s]  What?
[10817.15s -> 10822.09s]  Why?
[10822.09s -> 10829.73s]  Why would you wanna end my stream right now?
[10829.73s -> 10838.25s]  Why would you wanna be that guy?
[10838.25s -> 10850.30s]  Wow, okay.
[10850.30s -> 10853.22s]  Don't end, just change the camera position.
[10854.64s -> 10859.65s]  Did you just spend one million points
[10859.65s -> 10861.69s]  to tell me to put the camera back
[10861.69s -> 10863.93s]  on the right side of my fucking...
[10869.18s -> 10870.66s]  No way.
[10872.12s -> 10878.16s]  No way you just did that.
[10878.16s -> 10881.26s]  I was like, this man is just flexing.
[10881.26s -> 10883.86s]  He's just like, yeah, I got some points to spare.
[10883.86s -> 10889.69s]  I guess I could like throw them, you know, eh.
[10889.69s -> 10902.01s]  All right, fine.
[10902.01s -> 10913.00s]  is that better is that better drink water actually that's a good one i'll be rb i'm gonna get some
[10913.00s -> 10921.13s]  water should we play on our main i kind of want to try and hit gm yeah let's get on our main account
[10921.13s -> 10930.43s]  it's like 1 p.m so it's like 3 p.m eastern i think i can get queues at the moment let me get
[10930.43s -> 10943.16s]  some water and then uh we'll queue up or we'll queue up then get some water real quick because
[10943.16s -> 10946.44s]  i think i think it's late enough in the day i can get queues now without waiting 40 minutes
[10946.44s -> 10957.40s]  By the way, it is a teaching stream when I'm doing that like adc academy thing
[10957.40s -> 10960.36s]  So if you guys have any questions you want to ask or like you guys can ignore that
[10960.72s -> 10962.72s]  If you guys have any questions you want to ask or anything like that
[10963.64s -> 10966.48s]  You know if we're just chillin between games just ask whatever you want
[10966.48s -> 10970.40s]  I I can answer a lot easier between games that I can in-game
[10971.24s -> 10974.20s]  You know, it's a lot easier for me to see that shit. I try and answer in-game
[10974.20s -> 10977.74s]  But like sometimes I'm like focusing and shit. So it's a little harder
[10984.67s -> 10988.03s]  I am gonna get some water though. So I'll be right back. Okay
[10988.35s -> 10991.87s]  Talk amongst yourselves.
[10991.87s -> 10993.51s]  Is Kraken troll on Cait?
[10993.51s -> 10996.13s]  No, Kraken's good on Cait.
[10996.13s -> 10999.99s]  You can go Kraken into Bloodthirster or Kraken into IE if you really need it.
[10999.99s -> 11001.95s]  If they have like tanks.
[11001.95s -> 11006.59s]  Say they have like Sion, Sejuani, stuff like that, that you have to like, you're the only
[11006.59s -> 11010.99s]  damage, let's say you're like the only tank killer on the team, you're the only AD damage,
[11010.99s -> 11011.99s]  you have to go Kraken sometimes.
[11011.99s -> 11073.99s]  Ba ba ba ba ba ba.
[11074.99s -> 11077.99s]  Birthday of my life.
[11077.99s -> 11080.99s]  My life.
[11944.37s -> 11946.37s]  to the
[11948.37s -> 11950.37s]  uh
[11950.37s -> 11952.37s]  uh
[11952.37s -> 11956.84s]  uh
[11956.84s -> 11958.84s]  uh
[11958.84s -> 11960.84s]  uh
[11960.84s -> 11977.08s]  uh
[11977.08s -> 11981.03s]  uh
[11981.03s -> 11984.34s]  uh
[11984.34s -> 11986.34s]  uh
[11986.34s -> 11988.34s]  uh
[11988.34s -> 11990.34s]  uh
[11990.34s -> 11992.34s]  uh
[11992.34s -> 11998.50s]  to lane it will like slow push towards them but i don't think i have a choice
[11999.94s -> 12002.82s]  i'd have to this is something that i'm actually i'd have to actually rewatch
[12003.86s -> 12009.14s]  i know i think it's actually frozen but i think maybe i should have cleared one minion maybe two
[12010.10s -> 12018.71s]  so that it doesn't like crash and it stays frozen unless i did it correctly maybe i'm overthinking
[12018.71s -> 12024.31s]  it. All right, I think I did it right. Yeah, I did. Okay, nevermind. I thought I was like
[12024.31s -> 12041.92s]  overthinking it. What do you think about Ghost instead of Heal and Jinx? I think it's great.
[12042.96s -> 12048.40s]  Like I said, this game specifically, I think Heal has more value. But I think in a lot of games,
[12048.40s -> 12053.52s]  Ghost is very good. Ghost is good on Ashe, good on Jinx, good on Aphelios,
[12054.16s -> 12058.48s]  Zeri. Like 80 carries at the moment, the Ghost meta is really good. Because like,
[12058.48s -> 12064.72s]  There's a really heavy like tank bruiser meta going on right coupled with like an enchantery meta or like a
[12065.12s -> 12070.32s]  Bot lane where it's like a bunch of melees. I suck jesus and because of that I think it's actually
[12072.24s -> 12075.36s]  Ghost is super good. I just this game. There's only two melees on the enemy team
[12076.08s -> 12080.26s]  and um
[12080.26s -> 12083.14s]  I didn't want to just farm lane this I wanted to be able to fight early
[12085.06s -> 12088.82s]  Well, okay, so the reason you take ghosts is because you farm lane
[12088.82s -> 12092.90s]  You're not looking to fight early when you take ghost.
[12092.90s -> 12094.34s]  That's the whole point of ghost.
[12094.34s -> 12095.34s]  It's a scaling.
[12095.34s -> 12097.86s]  It's a hundred percent of scaling summoner.
[12097.86s -> 12102.62s]  So if you're playing in lower elo, um, and you, you know, you want to take ghost or you
[12102.62s -> 12106.86s]  want to try it out, just realize that like you are trying to scale.
[12106.86s -> 12109.66s]  Oh, somebody AFKed.
[12109.66s -> 12110.66s]  Okay.
[12110.66s -> 12111.66s]  That's cringe.
[12111.66s -> 12122.13s]  Like if you're in, say you're in like gold, silver, plat, whatever elo you're in, that's
[12122.13s -> 12126.21s]  like you deemed as like you know a bit of the lower elos i don't even think plat's that low but
[12126.21s -> 12131.57s]  gold and silver right um because gold is average so it's like not even low typically but everybody
[12131.57s -> 12138.53s]  says it's low uh if you if you take ghost just understand that you are playing for mid game
[12138.53s -> 12144.21s]  bronze still you're playing for mid game yeah ghost is fun i i would take personally i would
[12144.21s -> 12148.93s]  probably take heal in bronze uh just because i think you can take advantage of lane phase
[12148.93s -> 12154.95s]  really hard in bronze like bronze elo to me is like
[12156.07s -> 12159.35s]  I should have reported that guy i'm stupid bronze elo to me is like
[12160.15s -> 12161.51s]  uh, you can
[12161.51s -> 12167.11s]  Learn how to abuse people's lane phase really hard because people will fight a lot in bronze, right?
[12167.11s -> 12172.31s]  Like they will take bad trades or they will like try and fight because they don't know typically if you're bronze
[12172.31s -> 12176.39s]  You probably don't know like the champions very well and the damage stuff and stuff like that
[12176.39s -> 12181.21s]  So what ends up happening is like you probably just die a bunch or there are probably a lot of deaths and bronze
[12181.67s -> 12185.36s]  so I would say
[12186.66s -> 12192.44s]  Playing to like be able to help yourself early game with all the fighting going on is gonna have a lot more value than ghost
[12194.20s -> 12200.52s]  Ghost is more of like a we hit mid game or a giant fight broke out and I can like it's an extended long fight
[12200.52s -> 12202.52s]  And I can get ghost utilization
[12202.56s -> 12205.48s]  Also ghost is really valuable when you have good mechanical skill
[12205.48s -> 12209.76s]  like ghost requires very good positioning typically because you're
[12209.76s -> 12212.84s]  repositioning a lot in the fight and that's why ghost is so good because you
[12212.84s -> 12215.56s]  can reposition back forward back forward back forward and you can
[12215.56s -> 12224.85s]  essentially like space the enemy and get free damage free boots too depends on
[12224.85s -> 12230.53s]  the champion and the matchup like if I'm playing Jinx and I'm playing into like I
[12230.53s -> 12235.65s]  don't know let's say I'm playing into like Kaisa Lulu okay you can take free
[12235.65s -> 12240.85s]  boots. You don't need early boots in that matchup because it's an enchanter farm ad carry versus an
[12240.85s -> 12245.73s]  enchanter farm ad carry okay. Now if I'm versus let's say I'm versus like a blitzcrank let's say
[12245.73s -> 12249.89s]  I'm playing jinx and I'm versus blitz like I typically don't want to have to wait till nine
[12249.89s -> 12255.89s]  minutes to get boots because blitzcrank's gonna shit on me so I will take different runes versus
[12255.89s -> 12261.65s]  that blitzcrank to allow myself the option of like let's say I have 1100 gold and I back I can
[12261.65s -> 12272.29s]  get early boots and now the blitzcrank has a much harder time dude i almost want to ban zed because
[12272.29s -> 12277.97s]  i don't want to get shit on by stylish but i think it's cringe i don't want to like ban stylish outs
[12294.90s -> 12302.29s]  how often does ad carry bot do you play parallel to your support you try to always essentially the
[12302.29s -> 12307.73s]  perfect way to play bot lane is you're both hitting one target at the same time trading on one target
[12307.73s -> 12311.41s]  at the same time you're making like a little triangle and you're both just like standing
[12311.41s -> 12316.69s]  next to each other and you're both hitting that one target right that's the best way to play
[12316.69s -> 12322.08s]  bot lane but it's very hard in solo queue obviously to do that but if you have like a
[12322.08s -> 12328.80s]  duo you can practice it sorry it went down the wrong pipe 80k tier list i should make one
[12329.76s -> 12337.60s]  i have this thing where even though i'm like grandmaster level i still think i suck i have
[12337.60s -> 12341.28s]  this like really lack of confidence because i i used to be challenger and now i'm like hardstuck
[12341.28s -> 12346.88s]  GM so like I have this lack of confidence in what I'm talking about so like I feel like if I were to
[12346.88s -> 12353.12s]  make a tier list it would be based on like a GM player's skill and I don't know if like I don't
[12353.12s -> 12376.20s]  want to get ripped apart by people but I guess I could make a tier list from my own opinion like
[12376.20s -> 12413.16s]  let me see tier list maker I'm sure there's a tier list maker with champions right yeah there it is
[12414.12s -> 12425.47s]  Wait, this is terrible. What is what are these pictures? I'm just what what is this? What is this?
[12426.87s -> 12441.92s]  Why is Nico on here? I want to use this one, but this one doesn't have Zeri
[12441.92s -> 12450.16s]  I'm trying to find one with Zeri on it. That doesn't look like shit. It says this one has Zeri
[12450.84s -> 12453.48s]  But it looks like it looks shitty. I don't I don't enjoy that
[12454.00s -> 12467.66s]  Hold on. We're gonna play ash this game because they picked Xerath
[12468.40s -> 12471.60s]  Like I just saw him first pick Xerath. So I want something that can engage on the Xerath
[12471.60s -> 12476.88s]  So we're gonna go Ash. These are gonna be my Ash runes this game, boys.
[12476.88s -> 12491.65s]  Do I want to go Presence of Mind? I don't know. I kind of do, but I kind of don't.
[12491.65s -> 12495.97s]  I think Presence of Mind kind of sucks. It feels kind of shitty.
[12495.97s -> 12504.31s]  Mmm, we can just do Overheal. We can go Alacrity.
[12504.31s -> 12510.28s]  I probably won't go Kraken Slayer this game, so we could probably just go Alacrity.
[12510.28s -> 12515.12s]  Even though Kraken Slayer's not bad on Ash, I kind of want to go Bork Rush.
[12515.12s -> 12529.72s]  but I could go I actually don't know what I want to take if I want to take
[12529.72s -> 12533.72s]  bloodline or alacrity I'm gonna take alacrity we'll try it out and then we'll
[12533.72s -> 12541.00s]  do ghost okay um what was I gonna say oh yeah yeah I need to find the right tier
[12541.00s -> 12560.13s]  list I mean I can just use this right I can't where's Zeri oh oh there we go
[12560.13s -> 12564.21s]  yeah this is good okay I was like I was trying to figure it out I was like what
[12564.21s -> 12566.72s]  What the fuck?
[12566.72s -> 12571.68s]  Uh, I think just straight out of the gate, I'm just putting Jinx in S tier.
[12571.68s -> 12573.92s]  I think Jinx is just an S tier champion.
[12573.92s -> 12576.96s]  She's crazy OP.
[12576.96s -> 12580.80s]  Like Jinx just does what every champion wants to do, but like better than them.
[12580.80s -> 12582.40s]  She's blind pickable.
[12582.40s -> 12585.52s]  Her two item, three item spike is crazy.
[12585.52s -> 12590.24s]  She's doesn't have a lot of like really bad matchups in lane phase anymore.
[12590.24s -> 12594.82s]  They gave her scaling like crazy high, like she's just good.
[12594.82s -> 12602.61s]  build paths etc like she's just a good champion uh i would say it's also hard to do tier list
[12602.61s -> 12607.33s]  because you have to do tier list for like low elo and high elo right because if i'm doing like a low
[12607.33s -> 12614.37s]  elo tier list you're putting mf like here right like mf's super good but if you're doing a high
[12614.37s -> 12621.57s]  elo tier list mf's like here it's it's hard to explain and like in low elo i'm putting kalista
[12621.57s -> 12632.13s]  here but in high elo i'm putting her here so it's it's really interesting right because it's all
[12632.13s -> 12637.17s]  based on like people's mechanical skill too but yeah we can do the tier list between games i guess
[12638.45s -> 12646.02s]  so far i think jinx is definitely s tier i wish there was like an s plus tier but jinx is
[12646.02s -> 12652.02s]  definitely s tier draven's hard to choose for me like i want to put him in a tier because he has a
[12652.02s -> 12660.32s]  a lot of counter matchups but in solo queue draven feels insane so it's it's hard because i i don't
[12660.32s -> 12666.24s]  think draven i think draven's overrated personally because i know how to beat draven players but i
[12666.24s -> 12676.11s]  also think in high elo when people also know how to deal with draven players the game i also do
[12676.11s -> 12681.71s]  feel like uh good draven players and good people who know how to play around draven players make
[12681.71s -> 12686.75s]  draven op uh but it's also the opposite where good players who know how to play around draven
[12686.75s -> 12706.35s]  can counter pick draven and make him worthless so it's it's really it's really hard all right let me
[12706.35s -> 12723.52s]  say morgana versus a mumu emumu jhin players jhin players are psychopaths man like i i don't think
[12723.52s -> 12727.12s]  jhin's very good right now i think he could be good if they gave him like a quality of life change
[12727.12s -> 12736.45s]  Isn't he getting buffed next patch? I think he's getting buffed. I think he should do like Jin's
[12737.09s -> 12739.33s]  Such a fun champ. He's just like a little shitty
[12749.68s -> 12752.48s]  We can actually just straight fight them right now if a Mumu just queues
[12755.87s -> 12757.87s]  Because uh Morgana's worthless level one
[12764.11s -> 12766.27s]  Like I actually just straight up want to fight these guys right now
[12768.56s -> 12782.11s]  Go go go. Oh, he missed both his queues
[12783.39s -> 12789.73s]  Dude, this guy this a Mumu's killing me man. Oh my god. I uh
[12789.73s -> 12795.98s]  Bro, what am I watching?
[12795.98s -> 12802.69s]  What are these queues, brother?
[12802.69s -> 12804.69s]  Holy shit.
[12804.69s -> 12811.90s]  All right, I should have taken long sword.
[12811.90s -> 12813.62s]  Amumu is not feeling himself today.
[12813.62s -> 12817.57s]  Let me tell you what.
[12817.57s -> 12834.59s]  He is not feeling himself.
[12834.59s -> 12835.59s]  Chase.
[12835.59s -> 12838.07s]  Even if it comes, chase.
[12838.07s -> 12846.07s]  Okay, we run.
[12846.07s -> 12847.43s]  I don't know if we can fight this.
[12847.43s -> 12848.43s]  We can try.
[12848.43s -> 12849.43s]  I'll volley.
[12849.43s -> 12863.99s]  I'll volley
[12863.99s -> 12865.99s]  Well, I mean that guy should die
[12872.10s -> 12874.70s]  Dude, what I don't even know what's happening right now. This is
[12875.34s -> 12876.90s]  This is crazy
[12876.90s -> 12884.45s]  This is this is ridiculous. Both mid laners just got like three kills out of nowhere
[12884.97s -> 12899.06s]  We went from like a ridiculously we went from like a grandmaster game to like a diamond game
[12899.78s -> 12901.38s]  like somehow
[12901.38s -> 12906.77s]  Like the Amumu's like kind of whipping some shit. I
[12907.89s -> 12912.49s]  Took a bad trade early then fucking this shit is funny as fuck
[12912.81s -> 12924.25s]  So, I'm gonna actually rush tier 2 boots this game, because I actually really, really, really
[12924.25s -> 12925.77s]  want to be mobile against their team.
[12925.77s -> 12930.49s]  Like, I'm just gonna straight up leave, go buy t2 boots, and that's gonna be my power
[12930.49s -> 12933.81s]  spike for Ashe right now.
[12933.81s -> 12937.29s]  They have so many things that I can dodge on their team, like look at this shit, right?
[12937.29s -> 12942.33s]  Like Morg binding, t2 boots, super easy to dodge if she can't flash it on me, right?
[12942.33s -> 12945.21s]  Like if she can't flash melee range, then Morg bind.
[12945.21s -> 12948.01s]  I should never get hit by it unless I have no fingers.
[12948.01s -> 12950.21s]  Ezreal Q, easy to dodge.
[12950.21s -> 12952.09s]  Xerath, easy to dodge.
[12952.09s -> 12955.41s]  This guy, whatever the fuck, Kha'Zix bug man,
[12955.41s -> 12963.21s]  he's a melee champ, so boots have value, et cetera.
[12963.21s -> 12965.21s]  Also, the cool thing about boots,
[12965.21s -> 12967.41s]  boots rush Ashe, is she doesn't have damage
[12968.73s -> 12970.93s]  that if I'm good at spacing,
[12970.93s -> 12972.69s]  like the better at spacing you are,
[12973.97s -> 12975.57s]  you can actually just 1v2,
[12976.73s -> 12979.13s]  especially against double skill shots like this.
[12979.53s -> 13005.37s]  It's pretty fun.
[13005.37s -> 13008.37s]  Fuck, if I duped that last Q, I would've killed that guy.
[13008.37s -> 13011.37s]  Dude, Xerath actually fucked us so bad though.
[13011.37s -> 13014.37s]  That was a good fight until Xerath just showed up and beat our ass.
[13014.37s -> 13031.26s]  Ah, yeah, just get the- just get the minion wave.
[13031.26s -> 13034.26s]  It's kind of funny to watch though, because I do so little damage,
[13034.26s -> 13041.53s]  but I also, like, just perma slow, so they can't do anything about it.
[13041.53s -> 13046.53s]  Hopefully, when TF gets 6, he can come bot and we can fuck over there bot lane.
[13046.53s -> 13049.07s]  I'm hoping that that's the case
[13055.68s -> 13064.20s]  We're gonna roam to mid. Kha'zix is also mid. TF's dead. That was a good roam
[13064.60s -> 13072.51s]  I'm gonna push this so that maybe we can play for a dragon
[13072.95s -> 13079.44s]  Cuz they might go for a dragon here and I think we can stop it. We have TF ults
[13084.04s -> 13089.22s]  Yep, nice. We just leave
[13090.22s -> 13093.78s]  We don't need to actually chase or do anything crazy. We're just stopping the dragon. That's all we're doing
[13095.14s -> 13104.65s]  Right. We don't want to give him a free drink. See the t2 boots are just broken. They're broken as shit
[13105.17s -> 13116.35s]  Because you can just see like I can I can pretty much just I'm just too fast for them to deal with
[13116.91s -> 13121.44s]  Like look at this. It's it's insane
[13122.08s -> 13134.37s]  And that's why I value like the tier two boots on champions
[13134.37s -> 13139.45s]  Especially like ash where you can be extra egregious with it because like her slow
[13140.45s -> 13144.41s]  Imagine is like, you know, it's the same idea as vain right when you think about it. It's like, okay
[13144.41s -> 13150.93s]  So what's really annoying trying to run away from a vein, right? She gets boots too and you're like goddamn it man
[13150.93s -> 13153.81s]  She's so fast. Same thing with ash. Oh wait now you're slow
[13155.09s -> 13157.41s]  So it's even more annoying you try you try and go in on her
[13157.41s -> 13163.19s]  She just spaces you walks away a bit. Now. You're just sitting there waddling towards her slowly just upset tilted frustrated
[13164.69s -> 13166.69s]  You know, it's like your middle school dance
[13185.01s -> 13189.42s]  You know what?
[13189.42s -> 13191.42s]  I think this is actually a shield bow game
[13192.78s -> 13196.54s]  It is I was gonna go bork, but I think this is a shield bow game
[13198.30s -> 13201.10s]  It could be a galeforce game too both both are both are viable
[13202.30s -> 13206.78s]  But uh, I actually I might be one of the I might be in the minority here with this
[13206.78s -> 13210.74s]  I think Bork rush on Ashe is actually good sometimes
[13212.02s -> 13215.94s]  Like I think if I was versus some tanks like, you know, like a Sion or something like that
[13215.94s -> 13218.34s]  I actually think Bork rush on Ashe is kind of cracked
[13219.50s -> 13223.98s]  Like yeah, it stalls out like you make the argument like it stalls out your three item or two item
[13224.26s -> 13226.50s]  But it's it feels kind of nuts
[13226.50s -> 13230.34s]  Also, this is a really OP thing that you can do.
[13230.34s -> 13232.02s]  I should have hawkshotted sooner.
[13232.02s -> 13237.54s]  I knew that they were doing Rift, but I'm not paying attention as much as I should be.
[13237.54s -> 13248.11s]  So, because what you can do is you can hawkshot to tell your team where the enemy jungler is
[13248.11s -> 13249.63s]  and get information yourself.
[13249.63s -> 13257.67s]  I mean, this Morgana's level 5.
[13257.67s -> 13262.35s]  We could fight just because Morg is 5 right now.
[13262.35s -> 13264.27s]  I kind of want to try.
[13264.27s -> 13278.29s]  Uh-oh. My Mumu didn't want to go in. My bad. I'm a little sad, I'm not gonna lie, because
[13278.29s -> 13284.49s]  I do feel like we win these fights, but our Mumu wants to wait for 6, which is fine, but
[13284.49s -> 13289.41s]  like I said, you guys know me, I like to actually fight and be active in the lane early, because
[13289.41s -> 13304.37s]  I know that we can fight, right? And so it's like, obviously, you know. Ooh, this is really
[13304.37s -> 13314.78s]  rough. I can't do anything because Xerath's here. TF's coming with ult though. I don't
[13314.78s -> 13321.01s]  have ult. God damn it. If I had ult, this would be so god tier. God, you have no idea
[13321.01s -> 13328.78s]  how OP this would be if I had ulti, man. Whatever, I'm bad. I want to push this wave out. I'm
[13328.78s -> 13334.74s]  assuming they're all backing. I think we penta there with ult. We even killed the top laner.
[13334.74s -> 13336.74s]  Oh, I'm dead. Why did I stay?
[13338.34s -> 13340.34s]  I knew Kha'zix would do that.
[13340.74s -> 13343.24s]  I have to retrain my brain. Kha'zix players are rats.
[13343.24s -> 13349.24s]  And I have to retrain my brain to remember that they will sit in a bush for 30 minutes, lose all of their farm, to get one kill.
[13350.24s -> 13351.54s]  I, like, always forget that.
[13355.42s -> 13357.72s]  Like, Kha'zix players are absolute fucking rats.
[13361.86s -> 13365.66s]  Like, I respect Rengar players more than Kha'zix players. Yeah, I said it. I know.
[13366.16s -> 13368.16s]  Hot take. I know. But I do.
[13368.16s -> 13373.33s]  I'm gonna try an arrow right here
[13377.00s -> 13378.28s]  Got him
[13378.28s -> 13381.98s]  You know that guy's pissed by the way
[13383.22s -> 13392.10s]  God damn it. He's gonna try and ult me from the bush
[13393.32s -> 13399.28s]  You can always tell that you're about to get ulted when an Ezreal big big tip for you guys if an Ezreal ever walks out
[13399.28s -> 13401.60s]  of vision expect that he's ulting you I
[13403.12s -> 13404.48s]  You would not believe
[13404.48s -> 13410.04s]  you would not believe the amount of people that I kill with Ezreal by simply walking into a bush and ulting them and
[13410.16s -> 13412.16s]  They forget that I exist
[13412.18s -> 13415.18s]  I'm not I'm not even kidding. It happens so often
[13416.30s -> 13419.30s]  They're just like oh, yeah, he went in the bush. He's gonna hit his old key
[13420.02s -> 13423.26s]  Like I it is comical how often it happens
[13423.94s -> 13425.94s]  And I'm sure you guys have died to it, too
[13427.26s -> 13431.44s]  Cuz it's like a thing where like you never see it. You barely you don't see Ezreal that often, right?
[13431.66s -> 13434.70s]  So because you probably don't see Ezreal too often. You're always like oh
[13437.01s -> 13445.66s]  Interesting type shit. I'm gonna grab this plate and then I'm gonna back up
[13447.68s -> 13450.00s]  Kha'zix is coming down here, so I'm gonna back the fuck up
[13451.32s -> 13453.32s]  So I don't have arrow for 20
[13454.00s -> 13456.10s]  Ezreal has Triforce. We need to back up a bit
[13459.44s -> 13463.92s]  We might have to give dragon. I could see giving dragon being okay, though. It's not that bad
[13464.48s -> 13474.46s]  Yeah, it's not it's not the worst to give drake here.
[13475.82s -> 13477.82s]  I could even back so we don't get dove
[13479.26s -> 13487.54s]  Like if we back now we might lose bot turret, but I can't walk up. Yeah, that's what I didn't want to have happen
[13487.54s -> 13496.23s]  see that's i'm telling you man rats absolute rats
[13500.47s -> 13516.08s]  kha'zix players are rats man absolute literal rats oh that's classy that's a good dodge
[13523.70s -> 13530.66s]  i can't even walk up bot uh i can wait for the turret but i can't walk up i'll just die
[13532.10s -> 13536.18s]  that's another thing you have to just accept like i'm down 40 cs this game because we've
[13536.18s -> 13543.02s]  We've just been getting weak sided and we've also been getting, uh, like Amumu is not very
[13543.02s -> 13544.02s]  good.
[13544.02s -> 13546.62s]  I don't, I don't have a better way to say it.
[13546.62s -> 13548.42s]  I don't have like a nice way to say it.
[13548.42s -> 13551.70s]  He's not having a good game.
[13551.70s -> 13555.08s]  And when your support doesn't have a good game, you don't have a good game early.
[13555.08s -> 13560.98s]  So the best thing you can do is just try and, uh, farm up what you can don't die and scale
[13560.98s -> 13561.98s]  for late.
[13561.98s -> 13568.97s]  It's all you can really do as an AD carry when your support sucks.
[13568.97s -> 13582.03s]  It feels really bad, but sometimes you just gotta accept it, right?
[13582.03s -> 13585.03s]  This Ezreal's not bad, but he's not good either.
[13585.03s -> 13587.19s]  Oh, this guy's gonna try and ult me.
[13587.19s -> 13588.75s]  I'm gonna ult kill range here.
[13588.75s -> 13592.72s]  Nice.
[13592.72s -> 13607.69s]  I don't have ult up yet, guys.
[13607.69s -> 13608.69s]  I don't have ult up yet.
[13608.69s -> 13610.85s]  I can't ulti.
[13610.85s -> 13615.96s]  I have ult now, but we need to bait them in a bit.
[13615.96s -> 13622.40s]  I don't even want to use my ult right now, to be honest with you, like I really don't.
[13622.40s -> 13623.40s]  You know what's funny?
[13623.40s -> 13624.40s]  That Xerath's actually pretty good.
[13624.40s -> 13627.00s]  I've played against him a few times in the past few seasons.
[13627.00s -> 13628.00s]  He's actually not bad.
[13628.00s -> 13630.16s]  He used to be a support main.
[13630.16s -> 13635.77s]  He played Xerath support.
[13635.77s -> 13643.55s]  That's why I recognize his name.
[13643.55s -> 13647.07s]  We should not go for this rift.
[13647.07s -> 13652.89s]  I'm on a bad timer for this, because I'm really low HP and mana.
[13652.89s -> 13671.28s]  Oh, I don't have mana to arrow here, guys.
[13671.28s -> 13674.86s]  I do not want to arrow that because the Fiora can totally...
[13674.86s -> 13681.98s]  The Fiora can do whatever it's called.
[13681.98s -> 13686.98s]  The Fiora can, what's it, whatever it's called, W it if she's fast enough, and I didn't want
[13686.98s -> 13689.16s]  to get my team killed.
[13689.16s -> 13690.84s]  The real issue here is that we're forcing...
[13690.84s -> 13695.74s]  Okay, I'll tell you exactly what the real issue is.
[13695.74s -> 13698.54s]  We're forcing too many fights for no reason right now.
[13698.54s -> 13701.22s]  So like, we're all forcing tons of fights at the moment, right?
[13701.22s -> 13705.22s]  But there's no reason for us to force these fights.
[13705.22s -> 13707.22s]  That's why my team's getting tilted, right?
[13707.22s -> 13713.10s]  Like, for some reason, the Amumu and the TF are both just like inting, and they're both
[13713.10s -> 13718.18s]  getting frustrated, but we actually win the game if we play it slow.
[13718.18s -> 13727.48s]  We can slow play this game out in scale, but it just takes time.
[13727.48s -> 13730.98s]  I specifically picked Ashe so that we could we had an answer for Xerath
[13731.68s -> 13736.30s]  Because we have TF and Ashe right so we have we have a really good answer for him. The problem is
[13738.14s -> 13740.14s]  We need to like stop tilting and just like
[13740.74s -> 13742.62s]  Understand that we can deal with him later
[13742.62s -> 13747.54s]  He's not like a he's not like an a soul right like a soul is one of those champs that like you can't deal with
[13748.54s -> 13753.60s]  Why did my Amumu wait to use ulti?
[13754.78s -> 13756.78s]  What?
[13756.82s -> 13758.82s]  He was in range
[13759.88s -> 13768.12s]  I know he was. Oh
[13769.12s -> 13773.16s]  Nice. Okay, we got a kill we need TF to play the game too, though
[13774.60s -> 13777.32s]  Our TF is really tilted. So he's just sitting bot
[13780.86s -> 13782.86s]  Amumu is extra tilted too, but I mean
[13783.38s -> 13788.94s]  I'll be I'll be honest the Amumu is playing worse than TF. It's just that he's dude. I hate when stuff happens like this
[13789.54s -> 13794.50s]  Stop stop pinging the guy man. He's already frustrated you pinging him is not gonna make him less frustrated
[13795.38s -> 13797.38s]  You're just gonna piss him off more
[13798.58s -> 13804.66s]  Like just play dude, we have a really good team comp
[13805.88s -> 13815.82s]  Like we're behind right now, but we have a good team comp. We should give this dragon by the way
[13816.36s -> 13819.80s]  Like a thousand percent. We don't have tfults
[13820.86s -> 13824.88s]  Like maybe maybe we could fight this but the morg's here so she can spell show my arrow
[13825.12s -> 13832.28s]  They got rifts like we should give the drink. We also have no vision control of this area
[13833.44s -> 13838.12s]  So this is another thing of like why you guys wonder like why I play support in this elo
[13838.12s -> 13841.24s]  Like I get asked a lot like why are you a support main now?
[13841.24s -> 13847.20s]  I'm still an AD main, but the thing is it's really hard to play the game when your supports
[13847.20s -> 13850.40s]  don't ward correctly.
[13850.40s -> 13851.48s]  We can give this guys, we can give.
[13851.48s -> 13852.48s]  It's not a huge deal.
[13852.48s -> 13853.48s]  Gnar's top.
[13853.48s -> 13854.48s]  We don't have to fight this.
[13854.48s -> 13856.84s]  Guys, we don't have to fight this.
[13856.84s -> 13858.08s]  Let's back up.
[13858.08s -> 13859.88s]  Yeah, like this isn't a fight.
[13859.88s -> 13866.82s]  It's only second dragon, it's nothing.
[13866.82s -> 13880.14s]  Wow, I suck at CSing.
[13880.14s -> 13882.50s]  But you see how little vision control we have on the map right now?
[13882.50s -> 13885.34s]  we have one ward here and that's about it.
[13885.34s -> 13889.18s]  Vision control is, I say it's 90% of the game in solo queue.
[13889.18s -> 13891.70s]  That's why I feel like supports are like the unsung hero.
[13891.70s -> 13893.74s]  Like when you get a support who knows how to properly
[13893.74s -> 13902.72s]  throw out vision control, it feels insane.
[13902.72s -> 13903.90s]  We just got to push.
[13905.02s -> 13906.92s]  I do have hawkshot in a second.
[13906.92s -> 13908.52s]  We can see if they're on this.
[13909.84s -> 13910.74s]  Okay, they're not.
[13912.32s -> 13916.49s]  I can volley, we can back up.
[13916.49s -> 13923.41s]  Kha'Zix is above me right now.
[13923.41s -> 13924.73s]  Okay, Kha'Zix wasted his ults.
[13924.73s -> 13925.57s]  That's not bad.
[13927.19s -> 13928.89s]  We should back.
[13928.89s -> 13930.09s]  I don't wanna take this fight.
[13930.09s -> 13933.33s]  TF could ulti, but he's not, right?
[13934.61s -> 13936.25s]  Like, this is one of those moments where, like,
[13936.25s -> 13937.81s]  I actually think we actually could've killed
[13937.81s -> 13940.05s]  two of them right there, if TF ulted.
[13941.33s -> 13945.77s]  Because they were out of position really hard.
[13945.77s -> 13948.96s]  But again, it's not, like,
[13948.96s -> 13952.04s]  I think they're gonna walk, I think Kha'Zix is,
[13953.44s -> 13956.36s]  yeah, he's somewhere up here, I don't know where he is.
[13956.36s -> 13957.92s]  And I can't, I can't hawk shot.
[13957.92s -> 13962.54s]  I wasted my hawk shot for this dragon or this baron.
[13962.54s -> 13963.66s]  They could be on baron.
[13964.82s -> 13967.26s]  We need to check, but I have no hawk shots.
[13967.26s -> 13968.66s]  Okay, they're not, they're not, we're chilling.
[13968.66s -> 13969.94s]  Good, good.
[13969.94s -> 13984.14s]  I need a hundred golds.
[13984.14s -> 13985.58s]  Yeah, I'm aware I'm getting ganked.
[13985.58s -> 14002.45s]  I'm fully fucking aware, trust me.
[14002.45s -> 14005.05s]  I'm just trying to force them to make a choice.
[14005.05s -> 14006.45s]  Probably wasn't a great use of my ghost,
[14006.45s -> 14018.82s]  but I say we bail.
[14018.82s -> 14022.14s]  I need to go get my item.
[14022.14s -> 14032.65s]  Ezreal's just pushing aside somehow uncontested over there.
[14032.65s -> 14038.05s]  Somebody just TP'd bot, what?
[14038.05s -> 14039.91s]  What the fuck is this Amumu doing?
[14040.79s -> 14041.73s]  What is my team doing?
[14041.73s -> 14043.43s]  What are you guys doing?
[14043.43s -> 14053.58s]  This is so awkward, man.
[14053.58s -> 14055.12s]  I mean, guys?
[14056.00s -> 14057.72s]  Guys, kill the Kha'Zix.
[14058.72s -> 14059.68s]  Oh, thank God.
[14061.12s -> 14064.00s]  I don't know why Kha'Zix just dove to kill me,
[14064.00s -> 14065.02s]  of all people.
[14066.16s -> 14067.88s]  My man just wanted me dead.
[14067.88s -> 14070.04s]  He was like, yeah, fuck that AD carry guy.
[14071.08s -> 14071.92s]  Like, okay.
[14073.34s -> 14075.34s]  Sure
[14075.66s -> 14078.34s]  Fuck me
[14078.34s -> 14081.05s]  What do I want?
[14081.05s -> 14084.17s]  I feel like I need damage, but I don't know what gives me the highest damage here
[14085.21s -> 14091.86s]  maybe just
[14091.86s -> 14093.86s]  I don't know. Maybe just pd
[14094.58s -> 14098.12s]  I'm not actually sure
[14098.12s -> 14100.12s]  IE would be good, but it doesn't give me like more
[14100.60s -> 14101.88s]  It gives me like
[14101.88s -> 14103.88s]  IE is interesting in this position
[14105.72s -> 14108.04s]  Like I almost want more movement speed from the like pd
[14108.04s -> 14113.64s]  Even though normally like the utility is better like maybe BT is still the best and I'm just trolling
[14114.20s -> 14126.02s]  We can just do dragon right now. They have no TP or Baron. I think we totally actually could do this
[14127.06s -> 14134.22s]  I'm down to try if you if you want to Rengar, they got two people bought they're setting up for dragon vision right now
[14134.72s -> 14137.84s]  I'm actually kind of down to just try and play for Baron here
[14144.75s -> 14148.97s]  Like we could bait Baron here and force them to walk into us with my arrow
[14176.38s -> 14194.78s]  I want to stay together because I don't know where the Kha'Zix is found him. What is my
[14194.78s -> 14198.92s]  Moomoo doing? Dude? He has smite like I pull it out if you're gonna do this, right like
[14199.84s -> 14220.48s]  I'll use your brain man. All right now we do Baron though. We have to we have to do Baron
[14220.90s -> 14228.80s]  This is like one of the worst players I've ever seen this a Moomoo. He has no clue what he's doing, by the way
[14229.88s -> 14235.99s]  Like he's so dumb
[14235.99s -> 14238.99s]  He's he's like flaming the TF. He's in his mind
[14238.99s -> 14242.43s]  He's so angry at this TF that he's ignoring every single thing that's going on
[14243.11s -> 14246.63s]  like he's ignoring that like the dragon was a bad call to begin with and
[14247.51s -> 14251.91s]  If we are gonna do that dragon, we have to zone the fucking jungler because he has fucking
[14253.19s -> 14255.19s]  smite right so it's like
[14256.43s -> 14258.43s]  What are you talking about
[14258.47s -> 14264.27s]  These players are crazy. It just feels to me like they're so angry at everything. It's kind of funny
[14264.27s -> 14271.02s]  Okay, I got three items now. I went for the PD because I kind of think the extra movement speed and the extra
[14272.10s -> 14277.71s]  It'll help a lot. I will say both the junglers are playing really well
[14278.55s -> 14280.55s]  this game is like
[14280.67s -> 14282.59s]  interesting
[14282.59s -> 14286.39s]  Like both the assassin junglers are playing pretty well the enemy Zarus playing pretty decent
[14293.24s -> 14294.92s]  What?
[14294.92s -> 14299.68s]  That is not a I I mean that was embarrassing. Like I don't even have words for that
[14299.68s -> 14314.10s]  Like I genuinely don't have words for that shit. I missed. I can't see we have no vision man
[14315.14s -> 14322.67s]  Like we have no vision
[14323.43s -> 14326.19s]  Nothing's warded because the mumu didn't put any wards down
[14329.23s -> 14334.67s]  So I can't fight because literally we're standing there in this area and there's nothing warded
[14335.15s -> 14343.68s]  The best part is all a mumu had to do was not die before that fight and we auto win
[14343.68s -> 14349.28s]  Like we were winning so hard, but this Amumu is actually solo losing us the game with his
[14349.28s -> 14350.68s]  fucking ego.
[14350.68s -> 14356.40s]  God, support players are so bad at League!
[14356.40s -> 14359.59s]  Actually!
[14359.59s -> 14360.91s]  And they'll deflect!
[14360.91s -> 14364.83s]  Support players will lie to themselves about how good they are and tell them that it's
[14364.83s -> 14371.95s]  always their team's fault, but they'll drop 9 deaths, have 9 kp in a fucking 23 kill game,
[14371.95s -> 14373.71s]  and then blame their fucking team.
[14375.19s -> 14384.74s]  It's crazy.
[14384.74s -> 14394.62s]  Please ward things, man.
[14394.62s -> 14396.56s]  Oh my God.
[14396.56s -> 14397.48s]  He's dead again.
[14404.47s -> 14407.53s]  Guys, why are we up here top?
[14407.53s -> 14408.81s]  Why are we top, guys?
[14415.39s -> 14417.35s]  Why are we three-manning top right now?
[14418.63s -> 14419.91s]  Holy crap.
[14421.37s -> 14423.43s]  My teammates are absolute apes.
[14424.31s -> 14425.81s]  Like, what am I watching, man?
[14425.81s -> 14432.82s]  They just three man's top.
[14432.82s -> 14434.18s]  Oh my god.
[14438.28s -> 14440.92s]  Like these are the worst players I've ever fucking seen.
[14441.92s -> 14444.54s]  Like we had the game in our hands
[14444.54s -> 14446.08s]  and then all of a sudden my team's like,
[14446.08s -> 14448.60s]  you know what, I don't actually wanna win.
[14448.60s -> 14449.44s]  And I'm like, why?
[14449.44s -> 14453.32s]  And they're like, well, you see, I have an ego.
[14453.32s -> 14455.48s]  And you're like, oh, I see.
[14455.48s -> 14458.80s]  This is why I can't play AD carry in this ELO, I'm sorry.
[14458.80s -> 14460.88s]  I can't, I have to play support in this ELO
[14460.88s -> 14463.12s]  because AD carry is actually not playable
[14465.12s -> 14467.60s]  when the entire game is decided by jungle,
[14467.60s -> 14469.48s]  support, and mid.
[14470.60s -> 14473.58s]  AD carry does not decide any of the League of Legends games
[14473.58s -> 14474.96s]  below Grandmaster.
[14474.96s -> 14475.80s]  Not one of them.
[14475.80s -> 14478.36s]  Like last game, we popped off and we won
[14478.36s -> 14480.68s]  because we were the better AD carry, right?
[14480.68s -> 14482.84s]  This game, it doesn't matter.
[14482.84s -> 14485.24s]  Because TF does 11k damage,
[14485.24s -> 14487.76s]  doesn't ulti bot more than one time.
[14487.76s -> 14489.64s]  Like Rengar did well.
[14489.64s -> 14492.84s]  Gnar did well, but they also had a horrible macro.
[14492.84s -> 14500.66s]  Like it is insane to me how easy support is as a role and just how dog shit every support
[14500.66s -> 14503.18s]  player is on the server.
[14503.18s -> 14506.18s]  Your role requires zero thought.
[14506.18s -> 14512.18s]  Your thought when playing support is, do I get vision or not?
[14512.18s -> 14515.78s]  If no, where can I be the most useful?
[14515.78s -> 14522.99s]  Your thought should never be, this game is over, my team sucks.
[14522.99s -> 14531.31s]  It drives me ludicrous, I'm sorry that I have to play support on this account to climb,
[14531.31s -> 14536.41s]  but it's crazy how dog shit adc is when solo queuing in masters.
[14536.41s -> 14540.45s]  In GM, if it's a full GM game, adc is easy as fuck.
[14540.45s -> 14544.85s]  If everyone has a brain activity and they're not idiots, adc is amazing.
[14544.85s -> 14545.91s]  Favorite role in the game.
[14545.91s -> 14549.09s]  When you're playing with people who don't know what they're doing and you're actively
[14549.09s -> 14554.09s]  trying to climb and improve, it genuinely feels like I'm pulling out a ball hair with
[14554.09s -> 14564.53s]  my tweezers, or pulling out my ball hairs with tweezers, like one by one. It is so painful.
[14564.53s -> 14574.14s]  It's crazy. Like let's take a look at this, this support main right now. 97 LP, negative
[14574.14s -> 14581.02s]  win rate, right? I could, I could literally tell that he was not a good player in the
[14581.02s -> 14589.59s]  first 30 seconds of that game. I'm sorry I'm being mean, but dude, this has been driving
[14589.59s -> 14599.64s]  me crazy, like look at the support I had last game. Also, can I ask a question? Why am I
[14599.64s -> 14607.92s]  even allowed? Why am I even allowed to be in games with a challenger support one game,
[14607.92s -> 14621.10s]  I win the game, then immediately it puts me in a game with a 97 LP master support. What
[14621.10s -> 14665.37s]  is this matchmaking? This is insane. That's crazy. I don't even I'm wondering why. So
[14665.37s -> 14670.97s]  I'm gonna go on a rant for a second. Why is this allowed? Why can you be in a game? Why
[14670.97s -> 14676.53s]  can I be in a game with a literal guy who's about to promote to challenger? Right, we
[14676.53s -> 14685.06s]  win the game. And then the very next game, it puts me in a game with a guy who's 97 LP.
[14685.06s -> 14686.06s]  This is insane.
[14686.06s -> 14704.39s]  Sorry, that's just frustrating as fuck.
[14704.39s -> 14709.40s]  Because it's like such bad game design, right?
[14709.40s -> 14718.30s]  Like that's 900 LP difference.
[14718.30s -> 14722.94s]  And the thing is, this guy doesn't have good MMR, right?
[14722.94s -> 14725.58s]  Like it's not like this guy has good MMR, right?
[14725.58s -> 14729.82s]  Because look at his games.
[14729.82s -> 14732.10s]  He's playing with all Masters players.
[14732.10s -> 14739.46s]  all like 100 LP masters 70 LP 30 LP right it doesn't make sense it's not like his MMR is high
[14740.18s -> 14747.22s]  so why is this guy getting into like a 600 LP grandmaster game why are we putting that guy in
[14747.22s -> 14758.06s]  the game that's so frustrating sorry i just i needed the vent how do you know which ad carry
[14758.06s -> 14767.18s]  pick in each situation uh it's a lot of knowledge a lot of knowledge like you have to know a lot
[14767.18s -> 14773.42s]  of shit like what the enemy champions do what your champions need to do to win the game what the win
[14773.42s -> 14782.30s]  cons are you can just pick and i'm being honest though you could just pick uh like there are 80
[14782.30s -> 14785.50s]  carries in the current meta where you can just pick that are blind like i was making a tier
[14785.50s -> 14791.74s]  list i forgot about it but i mean you can blind pick jinx pretty much every game like jinx is
[14791.74s -> 14797.26s]  just blindable every game pretty much she's insane she's super op so like if you if you ever just
[14797.26s -> 14801.58s]  want to play a champion and you think like okay i want to practice ad like jinx is insane super good
[14802.22s -> 14810.57s]  um draven's not blindable but i do think he's really good if you're good at the game draven's
[14810.57s -> 14817.13s]  very good he's he's he's harder than jinx by a mile like draven's a lot harder but he's definitely
[14817.13s -> 14823.94s]  like good at carrying with a lead as well like another blindable ad that i think is like a tier
[14823.94s -> 14829.38s]  is like varus you can blind pick varus really easily because varus doesn't really have counters
[14830.58s -> 14835.70s]  Like he doesn't get countered by anything. He's more of like a you can pick him and then
[14836.42s -> 14841.22s]  Go even and your ulti will always be useful. You can look to like win lane. You can look to like
[14842.02s -> 14867.67s]  Engage things like that, right?
[14867.83s -> 14869.83s]  Uh, okay. So this game
[14870.39s -> 14872.87s]  Uh as the support I need to be tracking the jungler
[14875.05s -> 14877.05s]  so i'm gonna think where
[14877.05s -> 14880.41s]  Always be thinking what the enemy jungler wants to accomplish and how to stop it
[14880.65s -> 14883.05s]  That's like a pretty big tip of advice that I can give you guys
[14883.05s -> 14888.17s]  like think to yourself like okay if i was the enemy jungler what would i be wanting to do
[14888.17s -> 14893.69s]  against the scrams right as lee sin he's probably going to want to either gank early like gank bot
[14893.69s -> 14900.81s]  early or he wants to um invade on certain timers right because that's like what lee is really good
[14900.81s -> 14909.37s]  at is ganking and invading so what i think i'm gonna try to do this game is i'm gonna try and
[14909.37s -> 14914.41s]  Watch for early ganks and early pressure bot lane like your level 2 level 3 ganks
[14915.09s -> 14921.27s]  We're still gonna be aggressive but Lux took TP, which means this Lux does not plan on playing aggressive at all
[14921.85s -> 14925.13s]  Like she basically if anybody takes TP like this in a lane. I
[14926.05s -> 14929.45s]  Already know from start of the game that they're not planning on doing anything
[14929.75s -> 14931.95s]  So I'm probably gonna end up roaming a lot this game
[14932.49s -> 14934.49s]  This is a this is gonna be a game where I roam a ton
[14948.68s -> 14952.48s]  We do have some good lanes to roam to to like roaming top and mid is both really good
[14952.84s -> 14970.16s]  I just wanted to ward early because I don't want to get shit on by Lee
[14971.40s -> 14973.12s]  so
[14973.12s -> 14975.12s]  Okay, I'm just gonna flash immediately
[14976.00s -> 14981.68s]  There's no reason to not flash there because Alistar used this flash to get my flash, which is totally fine
[14982.00s -> 14986.14s]  It's better for him because he has hex flash, but it's not that bad
[14990.54s -> 14993.70s]  Because I can out range him and I can stay away from his
[14994.42s -> 14999.22s]  His shit, so we know he's in the bush. We just chill
[14999.22s -> 15002.72s]  There it is. He fucked up now we go forward. I
[15004.22s -> 15008.22s]  Don't know why Lux isn't throwing spells at this guy like like I don't know why she didn't queue him
[15009.34s -> 15011.60s]  Like he fucked up the Alistar should have died there
[15013.02s -> 15014.14s]  And she's pinging me
[15014.14s -> 15014.70s]  Okay
[15014.70s -> 15018.94s]  The Alistar should have died there if Alistar ever fucks up an engage like that where he hex flashes in
[15019.26s -> 15025.06s]  Gets stuck like Q is cooldown. Yeah, I don't know why it was thrown is what I'm saying. You don't throw you don't throw spells
[15025.06s -> 15026.38s]  that
[15026.38s -> 15027.90s]  That aren't gonna lands
[15027.90s -> 15033.18s]  So there's no point in Lux ever throwing her Q until Alistar fucks up the combo
[15033.86s -> 15038.58s]  Like she should just poke with E and then because it's almost like a blitz hook, right?
[15038.58s -> 15043.62s]  Think of think of it like a blitz hook if she throws the the Q out, right now
[15043.62s -> 15047.74s]  They have an opportunity to be aggressive because they know the hook. They know that the hook is down
[15048.62s -> 15052.06s]  So it's better for her to just hold the hook essentially, right?
[15053.42s -> 15058.90s]  Hold the Q and now when Alistar does go in they have to be nervous about that Q
[15059.34s -> 15064.16s]  Because they can't just think oh the cues down. Let's let's engage right so they can't actually think about that
[15064.88s -> 15066.88s]  This is why I don't like
[15067.44s -> 15071.39s]  a
[15071.39s -> 15073.91s]  Lot of the time doing this like push push the way
[15074.43s -> 15087.85s]  They can't engage on us without like flashing so it doesn't matter like what did she cue the wave again or my an idiot?
[15089.91s -> 15092.79s]  Like just oh man. I'm losing my mind here. Oh
[15093.39s -> 15095.31s]  These I'm tilting
[15095.31s -> 15101.19s]  It's fine. I need to not tilt. I need to just chill but I'm getting frustrated because we're like not using
[15101.71s -> 15103.91s]  Cooldowns properly and it's driving me fucking crazy
[15107.58s -> 15112.22s]  Because these are very simple things to do you guys got to walk the wave in by the way, you can't let them freeze
[15112.22s -> 15114.42s]  Okay, they're very simple things to do
[15114.42s -> 15116.30s]  I know I'm being annoying as shit whining about this
[15116.30s -> 15121.66s]  But this is stuff that you you need to be thinking about when you're playing the game. Well, you should actively be thinking
[15121.66s -> 15128.46s]  uh, what can I do with my champion's toolkit to stop their champion's toolkit?
[15129.10s -> 15135.26s]  And you should be thinking, okay, I have Q, right? So what do they want to do? They want to go in,
[15135.26s -> 15142.56s]  okay? And when you're thinking, they want to go in, right? You should be thinking, okay,
[15142.56s -> 15146.64s]  when they go in, I can just Q. And that should be your entire thought process.
[15147.68s -> 15153.92s]  Your thought process should never be, oh, maybe I can land a random Q at max range and we can get
[15153.92s -> 15161.84s]  a kill she queued the wave yes that's what i mean like you should never queue the wave on lux either
[15161.84s -> 15167.98s]  unless you're going to 100% reset that would be like if i hooked the wave as like blitzcrank or
[15167.98s -> 15175.66s]  some shits why is my lux bait pinging my graves dude i gotta keep this 100% honest with you man
[15177.74s -> 15184.06s]  you don't get you you don't get to be mad here why are dude these players are such babies
[15184.06s -> 15195.09s]  Jesus Christ, what pussies, man. These people are such babies. The graves played correctly
[15195.09s -> 15201.23s]  by the way, like 100%. He's mad at the graves for taking a wave. He wanted to not like,
[15201.23s -> 15205.83s]  he wanted to be able to TP back and get the wave. That's what this Lux is so trash that
[15205.83s -> 15212.03s]  she actually believes that the graves fault, that graves misplayed by pushing the bot wave.
[15212.03s -> 15216.73s]  But it was the right play. Pushing the bot wave was the correct play there, because then
[15216.73s -> 15221.85s]  she doesn't have to tp. The whole reason that he's pushing it is to save her teleport, so that she
[15221.85s -> 15230.44s]  doesn't have to tp to lane. Players like this are why the game is hard to play right now in the
[15230.44s -> 15236.84s]  current meta. Why it feels bad. Because this Lux is trash. You guys can all see this Lux is terrible.
[15236.84s -> 15240.76s]  She's already made a bunch of mistakes, she's blaming her team, she's being a dipshit, right?
[15241.64s -> 15251.45s]  But, she can climb up to this elo being this bad because of the system, the current system in
[15251.45s -> 15276.81s]  in place. We should immediately do Baron here. Dragon, I mean, we should do this. Come. You
[15276.81s -> 15281.77s]  don't have time for this. Just come do dragon. Bro, the Lee Sin just showed top. We should
[15281.77s -> 15301.34s]  be doing dragon. When, um, when this shit happens, by the way, where you have, um, enemy
[15301.34s -> 15305.50s]  jungler shows on one side of the map, you should always be playing on the other side
[15305.50s -> 15312.66s]  of the map to make a counterplay. So jungler shows on top side. We go for dragon, right?
[15312.66s -> 15321.10s]  Easy. Yo, be careful. Alistar's going to be there. Xerath's going to be there. Just leave.
[15321.90s -> 15327.23s]  Just leave. Leave, leave, leave. I'll do it for you. I'll make you leave. I got you, man.
[15329.90s -> 15334.70s]  But we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and, um, I need to back now,
[15334.70s -> 15338.86s]  but we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back. And not only did their bot lane have
[15338.86s -> 15355.30s]  to back, but the enemy was top. I, I tried, man. I tried to flash Q him. But yeah, it's,
[15355.30s -> 15359.78s]  It's really I don't know a lot of junglers don't I don't think they know what they're oh, i'm dead by the way
[15360.42s -> 15362.50s]  I'm, not even gonna pop exhaust. I'm just dead
[15364.02s -> 15365.86s]  A lot of junglers don't know
[15365.86s -> 15370.42s]  What the goal of the game actually is a lot of them think it's that was a bad insect
[15370.42s -> 15374.58s]  But a lot of junglers think the goal of the game is to like get as much farm as you can and run over
[15374.74s -> 15378.50s]  the enemy team and shit, but it's actually it is but it's also about like
[15379.30s -> 15383.38s]  Getting early objectives and turning those small leads into big leads through objective control
[15383.38s -> 15390.70s]  Right? So like right now, I want to rotate top. Rift is up. I know Lee Sin's gonna be
[15390.70s -> 15395.98s]  on top side of the map right now. I want to rotate top so that I can help my team by being
[15395.98s -> 15404.00s]  in the top side of the map, because that's where the next play is gonna be made. Well,
[15404.00s -> 15420.26s]  the play's made mid, but I mean, I'm here, so it's fine. Oh my god. I did not think the
[15420.26s -> 15431.22s]  fucking Lee Sin would be there too. Oh, oops. This is rough. I don't really know how to
[15431.22s -> 15435.06s]  How to play this because I got there in time to counter the gank
[15435.86s -> 15437.34s]  right, I
[15437.34s -> 15441.50s]  Exhausted the guy saved the Zerath. I got there in time to counter the gank, but oh
[15444.32s -> 15446.32s]  well played
[15446.76s -> 15449.24s]  Does actually mega well played
[15450.88s -> 15454.45s]  That was really good I
[15454.49s -> 15456.49s]  Want to push this way then but I can't
[15465.06s -> 15470.74s]  Like you guys are noticing. There's no objectives taken on the map yet at 10 minutes, which is kind of crazy
[15470.74s -> 15475.74s]  The ally's doing really good. The Alistar's not a bad support player. He's playing well.
[15475.74s -> 15493.94s]  Like, he's playing very well.
[15493.94s -> 15498.94s]  A lot of this is more of like, I need- I don't have anything to do on the map because, uh,
[15498.94s -> 15501.94s]  I'm trying to help my jungler, but my jungler's trolling.
[15501.94s -> 15504.94s]  It's really rough.
[15504.94s -> 15508.94s]  Cause like, I'm trying to rotate over and help my jungler on cooldown, basically, right?
[15508.94s -> 15510.94s]  But my jungler doesn't want to fight.
[15510.94s -> 15521.05s]  You see, like, I'm countering the Alistar's fight- er, ganks. It's just...
[15521.05s -> 15522.05s]  I'm just dead.
[15524.46s -> 15525.18s]  Dude.
[15527.26s -> 15529.26s]  Like, we shouldn't have made that play mid.
[15529.54s -> 15533.70s]  Because we knew that they were all there, and we knew that our jungler's doing this.
[15534.98s -> 15537.22s]  This might just be a jungle diff, honestly.
[15538.94s -> 15541.78s]  Like, our AD carry sucks, but it might just be a straight up jungle diff game.
[15542.06s -> 15542.98s]  They do happen.
[15544.78s -> 15547.38s]  Especially in this elo, where jungle has so much control of the game.
[15547.70s -> 15548.50s]  They do happen.
[15553.12s -> 15556.08s]  It's a pretty big jungle diff, Chipoppy. You know it. I know it.
[15556.68s -> 15561.00s]  Like yeah, he's saying yeah, but he knows the jungle is getting out outclassed
[15562.00s -> 15568.77s]  Insanely hard cuz graves counters Lee sin. It's a massive counter
[15569.35s -> 15579.91s]  But this guy doesn't know what he's doing. I think he's a Rengar one trick and Rengar got banned. I think that's what's going on
[15581.05s -> 15587.29s]  It's a Rengar one trick who got banned out and he tried to play a champion that requires thought not just a I jump
[15587.29s -> 15589.13s]  you die champ
[15589.13s -> 15599.32s]  Right, and he just gets shit on for it. I mean dude, I can't even I can't even do anything this game
[15600.64s -> 15610.19s]  Our top laner is getting his ass whipped too. It's really fucking rough. I mean he's in here. I'm pretty sure
[15610.91s -> 15613.23s]  It's not it was just it was warded though. I
[15614.31s -> 15616.99s]  Mean, we can't really do anything here. I'm dead. I think
[15617.99s -> 15619.99s]  Yeah, I'm just dead
[15620.27s -> 15624.39s]  This is just rough. I I kind of want to go next because I don't think I
[15624.39s -> 15627.41s]  I don't think we have the skill on the team to win
[15629.19s -> 15634.27s]  The jungle def is huge the 80 def is huge and I'm just I can't I can't impact the map
[15647.94s -> 15651.60s]  Like I I can't I just can't do anything this game to impact the map and it feels really bad. Oh
[15662.67s -> 15664.67s]  Son of a bitch I should have flashed. I
[15667.70s -> 15671.20s]  Got like creep walked a little bit when he knocked me and I like had to walk through I should just flashed up
[15671.20s -> 15675.38s]  That's my man. Like what was that TP man? Oh god, get me out
[15676.10s -> 15679.50s]  I'm gonna be a hundred percent real get me out. That TP was miserably bad
[15679.90s -> 15694.96s]  Dude just tp'd to the wave like what is our lux doing too like i just feel like everybody's
[15694.96s -> 15702.26s]  late to the fights lux is always late to the fights the graves doesn't want to take fights
[15702.26s -> 15707.22s]  even though he's playing graves into lee sin like i i feel like oh this is rough this is
[15707.22s -> 15712.10s]  a rough game games like this tilt me and i kind of just want to go next because games
[15712.10s -> 15717.22s]  like this i they are winnable but i feel like i want to go next to save mental you know like
[15717.22s -> 15734.10s]  lowkey i just want to save my mental because oh that's so gross like watching what lux did in the
[15734.10s -> 15738.82s]  early stages of the lane phase just wasting her q on repeat that was one of the most embarrassing
[15738.82s -> 15759.75s]  things ever and then like look at that she just q'd a minion oh bro like oh my god you gotta push
[15759.75s -> 15779.74s]  the wave man holy shits I mean I can't even walk oh my god I don't even have
[15779.74s -> 15789.88s]  help from my fucking team that's the worst part about this dude these games
[15789.88s -> 15795.68s]  feel so unplayable man like I don't know how else to say it except for they just
[15795.68s -> 15804.24s]  just feel miserable to play. I'm trying to focus on improving myself, but it's so hard
[15804.24s -> 15817.41s]  to know how to improve in games where you genuinely just get no help. My Lux has been
[15817.41s -> 15823.37s]  tilted since minute 2 for some reason, and my graves has been completely pathing wrong,
[15823.37s -> 15828.33s]  doing wrong shit. It's hard to know how to help. I went mid to help, countered 2 of the
[15828.33s -> 15836.22s]  early ganks. Lux still griefed the game. So like yeah it's just it's hard to know and then top lane
[15836.22s -> 15850.09s]  lost. It's so rough man. Like I'm gonna keep it 100% honest with you. If you are a one trick,
[15850.09s -> 15860.68s]  do not try and play other champs. You you will int. You will play badly always and you will int
[15861.64s -> 15868.84s]  and you will you will complete like look at this this is 2.9k damage as a dude like what are we
[15868.84s -> 15881.44s]  doing how are these people getting into this elo how does this lux like in the game she was against
[15881.44s -> 15890.48s]  an alistar bot and she did one point 2.9k damage in a 16 minute game against a melee heavy team
[15892.00s -> 15902.67s]  like what is this what is happening this guy was d4 30 lp last season and now he's magically in
[15902.67s -> 15918.32s]  masters? No, we need to fix matchmaking. This is this is insane. Like this is just a matchmaking
[15918.32s -> 15927.28s]  diff. It's nothing else. My man literally does not belong in master tier 400 LP MMR at all.
[15927.28s -> 15945.98s]  Well, you can see that he's not at this level. Dude, I have the Lux player on my team again.
[15954.91s -> 15962.59s]  This is Xerath one trick and a Rengar one trick on the enemy team. I don't know, man.
[15962.59s -> 15983.51s]  I guess I care more about the Rengar than the Xerath, but this is rough. Oh, what's up?
[15983.51s -> 15987.39s]  Chupapi dude. Sorry. I hit yes on that man. I know the game was winnable
[15987.39s -> 15992.31s]  I'm gonna be real but dude you didn't see what I saw during the early game of that game Chupapi
[15992.83s -> 15998.70s]  like man the entire early game of that game was like
[15999.34s -> 16001.34s]  We lost lane
[16001.38s -> 16007.74s]  Because Lux wouldn't use her Q to fight the Alistar. She was using it to farm minions
[16007.74s -> 16014.10s]  Like, she was so scared of being engaged on by the Alistar and the Kalista that she would
[16014.10s -> 16020.22s]  use her Q to max range farm minions instead of save it so when the Alistar engages, we
[16020.22s -> 16023.02s]  just kill him, right?
[16023.02s -> 16026.58s]  Because if Alistar ever engages on me and Lux, he just gets killed.
[16026.58s -> 16030.34s]  We just bind him, walk away, and he's stuck there, and he dies, right?
[16030.34s -> 16036.10s]  But for some reason, she didn't understand how to do that, so she was just throwing it
[16036.10s -> 16038.38s]  to farm so we would just get engaged on.
[16038.38s -> 16042.62s]  So I started roaming, and every time I was like roaming to an objective or something,
[16042.62s -> 16046.18s]  the graves would always walk away and not fight.
[16046.18s -> 16049.26s]  Like he wasn't attempting to fight, he was basically just like, oh I'm gonna go farm
[16049.26s -> 16050.26s]  some more.
[16050.26s -> 16051.58s]  But I'm like, dude, you can't do that.
[16051.58s -> 16055.38s]  Like if the Alistar's ganking mid and I'm countering mid, you can't just farm farm before
[16055.38s -> 16056.38s]  coming mid.
[16056.38s -> 16058.18s]  Or you can't just like not take dragon and shit like that, right?
[16058.18s -> 16062.54s]  Like it blows my mind that these players can get, like it's like this guy too.
[16062.54s -> 16064.62s]  Same thing, like that jungler last game, right?
[16064.62s -> 16065.62s]  Look at this.
[16065.62s -> 16067.14s]  It's the same thing as the last game.
[16067.14s -> 16072.02s]  NA is riddled with this shit, and it's so miserable to play. Look at this, this jungler last game,
[16072.02s -> 16076.42s]  right? He's not, he's what, like a D1 player, right? He's not a bad player, he peaks D1.
[16076.42s -> 16080.58s]  But why is this guy in this game now? He like artificially inflated to this elo,
[16080.58s -> 16084.98s]  getting lucky with his first few games, and now we have to play with this guy. Oh,
[16084.98s -> 16093.25s]  it's an account share. The person, it's a different player, look, on the account.
[16093.25s -> 16112.48s]  D flash F flash. So, uh, it's a fucking account share. That's that's frustrating. Sorry for
[16112.48s -> 16117.66s]  whining so much guys. This shit's just really frustrating to me. Like I know I should play
[16117.66s -> 16121.74s]  it to like specifically only care about like improving and then while you're improving
[16121.74s -> 16128.06s]  you'll climb automatically and shit. But it's really frustrating when like the players in
[16128.06s -> 16132.22s]  the game would rather be idiots and assholes to each other than play the game. Right? Like
[16132.22s -> 16134.22s]  The game before, the Amumu, right?
[16134.22s -> 16136.04s]  The game before this, the Amumu was just being toxic
[16136.04s -> 16138.22s]  the whole game and inted the win away.
[16138.22s -> 16140.02s]  The last game, the Lux and the Graves
[16140.02s -> 16141.94s]  were being toxic to each other the whole game.
[16141.94s -> 16143.90s]  We inted the game away.
[16143.90s -> 16147.66s]  It's like, it's not fun to lose
[16147.66s -> 16149.66s]  because one player gets mad at another player
[16149.66s -> 16154.57s]  over them both being idiots.
[16154.57s -> 16156.15s]  I'm sorry, it's not fun.
[16156.15s -> 16157.35s]  It's so unfun.
[16158.63s -> 16173.04s]  But we'll try and win this one.
[16173.04s -> 16193.54s]  we can really do is try and carry the games right? It's about it. What is what? What man? What? What
[16193.54s -> 16197.86s]  do you think they're going to do to me? Welcome to the League of Yo, thank you for the seven months
[16197.86s -> 16203.70s]  man. Welcome back. I really don't want to meet all I don't I don't want to meet all because like I
[16203.70s -> 16219.49s]  want to like value the pings and shit. But dude, if they walk up, I'm gonna flank them. That's
[16219.49s -> 16220.69s]  That's why I'm standing here.
[16220.69s -> 16253.44s]  Okay, they're on me.
[16253.44s -> 16255.46s]  Well, that was a big Q.
[16255.46s -> 16276.33s]  I need to get level two first here, 100%.
[16276.33s -> 16279.09s]  Ashe should have just been autoing there that whole time.
[16280.35s -> 16281.25s]  Cause we have heal.
[16281.25s -> 16283.61s]  So she should have just walked up and autoed.
[16283.61s -> 16286.57s]  As soon as, this is what I mean by tracking cooldowns.
[16286.57s -> 16289.01s]  As soon as the Neeko missed her,
[16289.01s -> 16291.13s]  as soon as the Neeko missed her cooldown,
[16291.13s -> 16292.73s]  as soon as she missed her E,
[16292.73s -> 16294.05s]  the Ashe should have just walked up
[16294.05s -> 16295.83s]  and immediately started fighting.
[16296.79s -> 16303.89s]  Right like because they can no longer kill us the Nico doesn't actually have spells outside of her e
[16304.57s -> 16309.39s]  Right, so if she misses that snare and she used her W to write so it's like we just go ham
[16309.85s -> 16317.09s]  You don't need to be too scared. It happens quite a bit sometimes where people will just be like really nervous
[16335.04s -> 16338.64s]  Damn, if I had dodged that Q, I actually would have killed all three
[16339.28s -> 16342.26s]  Damn, I don't know if it was worth the flash after the guy
[16342.26s -> 16345.16s]  I think it was if I had dodged the Q I would have been fine
[16346.28s -> 16348.28s]  So that was, it's whatever.
[16348.28s -> 16350.28s]  Ack also doesn't miss any creeps here.
[16350.28s -> 16352.28s]  So it's not the end of the world.
[16352.28s -> 16357.89s]  Like I'm pretty sure Lee Sin
[16357.89s -> 16359.89s]  did not have his top camps by the way.
[16359.89s -> 16368.45s]  Damn, if I was a little better mechanically
[16368.45s -> 16370.45s]  I'd turn that by the way.
[16370.45s -> 16374.28s]  100%.
[16374.28s -> 16376.28s]  We should push this wave so that I can go
[16376.28s -> 16398.02s]  get vision.
[16398.02s -> 16400.02s]  Cause yeah, that guy can't freeze that wave
[16400.02s -> 16404.48s]  so, it's not too bad.
[16404.48s -> 16425.11s]  Lee Sin's top.
[16425.11s -> 16427.11s]  You can kinda see some really good
[16427.11s -> 16454.26s]  uh, what is this? Why's my Karthus AFK at turret? What is happening right now? Why was
[16454.26s -> 16469.98s]  he AFK? I mean, I guess it worked out, but yeah. Maybe he had to go let his cat out.
[16469.98s -> 16484.02s]  I don't know. Happens. We, dude, their bot lane's not very good. They're trying too hard
[16484.02s -> 16491.60s]  to force fights that they can't win. Like they, they genuinely can't win half these
[16491.60s -> 16495.80s]  fights that they're trying to force. Maybe if they were against people who like don't
[16495.80s -> 16497.16s]  push their buttons, they could win those,
[16497.16s -> 16498.82s]  but it's like, all I have to do is stand there
[16498.82s -> 16500.92s]  and fight back and they lose.
[16500.92s -> 16503.50s]  They're on dragon 1,000% right now.
[16503.50s -> 16506.24s]  There's not a lot I can do about that.
[16506.24s -> 16507.56s]  We just have to chill.
[16507.56s -> 16509.48s]  There's almost nothing I can do about it.
[16509.48s -> 16511.64s]  Kai'Sa's trying to fake act like she's big,
[16511.64s -> 16517.23s]  but it's just, there's just nothing we can do.
[16519.60s -> 16526.91s]  Because our Karthus is top, so we just chill.
[16526.91s -> 16527.73s]  Did I finish the cheer list?
[16527.73s -> 16529.43s]  No, no, no, not yet.
[16530.95s -> 16534.11s]  Whoa.
[16534.11s -> 16535.71s]  Lee Sin could be bot right now.
[16538.15s -> 16540.07s]  I don't think it's too bad if he's bot though.
[16540.07s -> 16557.38s]  They can't really dive us, especially with Karthus ults.
[16557.38s -> 16559.48s]  Why does my Ashe just run?
[16564.92s -> 16566.92s]  She like just straight up runs away.
[16566.92s -> 16568.14s]  It's kind of silly.
[16577.28s -> 16578.96s]  Because we have Karthus ulti,
[16578.96s -> 16585.76s]  like we can win a fight bot right now.
[16585.76s -> 16588.00s]  I guess I'm just going to have to get them low enough
[16588.00s -> 16589.26s]  for Karthus to kill them.
[16590.78s -> 16592.82s]  Like without the Ashe's help.
[16594.06s -> 16597.69s]  Which I think I can do, it's not too bad.
[16597.69s -> 16599.65s]  Okay, the Akali's coming bot.
[16600.85s -> 16611.08s]  We just killed him, I mean, let's just fight.
[16611.08s -> 16615.28s]  I don't know why, we should just Ashe arrow, honestly.
[16615.28s -> 16621.79s]  Just Ashe arrow him.
[16621.79s -> 16630.84s]  Okay, that was pretty bad Ashe arrow, but.
[16630.84s -> 16632.00s]  Filled?
[16632.00s -> 16632.84s]  I don't think he's filled,
[16632.84s -> 16634.40s]  I think he's just having a bad game.
[16635.44s -> 16636.88s]  I think it happens, you know?
[16637.98s -> 16638.90s]  Whoa, okay.
[16642.92s -> 16644.92s]  Do it, ult me, I fucking dare you.
[16649.62s -> 16651.90s]  I'm trying to keep some mana,
[16651.90s -> 16653.16s]  so that I can ulti.
[16666.98s -> 16668.76s]  Oh, Karthus already used his ults.
[16668.76s -> 16675.66s]  Fuck.
[16675.66s -> 16677.28s]  They both backed there?
[16677.28s -> 16682.06s]  Wow.
[16682.06s -> 16682.90s]  My bad.
[16682.90s -> 16687.10s]  I honestly didn't think they were both gonna back there.
[16687.10s -> 16688.62s]  Like, I thought the Kai'Sa was gonna back
[16688.62s -> 16691.10s]  right where I saw her, like, last.
[16691.10s -> 16692.70s]  That was my bad.
[16692.70s -> 16693.86s]  Hmm, I should B.
[16695.16s -> 16700.14s]  I think Lee Sin can come bot here and kill me.
[16700.14s -> 16706.97s]  I should actually stop this guy's back.
[16706.97s -> 16708.41s]  Yeah, I should stop his back,
[16708.41s -> 16710.73s]  because it's more value to stop the back now.
[16710.73s -> 16712.93s]  Even if Lee Sin isn't bot, it's more value.
[16713.97s -> 16714.89s]  Cause he's so low.
[16716.73s -> 16718.97s]  Kali is Mia though, so we gotta be careful.
[16720.85s -> 16724.25s]  I wasted my ult though, which makes me kinda scared.
[16724.25s -> 16725.53s]  The other thing that kinda sucks about this
[16725.53s -> 16734.11s]  is we don't have good vision.
[16734.11s -> 16735.77s]  And I can't really help anybody on the map
[16735.77s -> 16738.07s]  because the same thing's happening as before.
[16738.91s -> 16740.57s]  We're like, we're missing opportunities
[16740.57s -> 16745.20s]  to get kills on timers.
[16745.20s -> 16747.40s]  I mean, the Dog Lightning guy's playing fine this game.
[16747.40s -> 16748.52s]  I think he's trolled a lot.
[16748.52s -> 16754.92s]  he's trolling. This isn't like his best game. But, it's also I don't know why we're getting
[16754.92s -> 16759.40s]  so tilted around the map right now. Because if I'm being honest, we should just win the game
[16759.40s -> 16781.03s]  off of like being better players. I don't know what this Karthus is thinking, but do it. Do it.
[16782.31s -> 16788.56s]  Karthus, we can fight. We can fight. Just fight. Bro, what are we doing?
[16788.56s -> 16791.84s]  I'm losing it, man.
[16791.84s -> 16794.00s]  Oh, no, no, no, I'm tilted.
[16794.00s -> 16795.00s]  I'm tilted as fuck.
[16795.00s -> 16796.00s]  He didn't walk in.
[16796.00s -> 16799.72s]  Just go on to the Akali shroud, man.
[16799.72s -> 16805.06s]  Like, just walk a foot to your right and stand on the Akali shroud.
[16805.06s -> 16807.96s]  She just eats your damage, like, while she's in the shroud.
[16807.96s -> 16808.96s]  She can't stop that.
[16808.96s -> 16817.12s]  Holy shit, I'm losing my minds.
[16817.12s -> 16822.72s]  Like Ashe is just inting bot waves right now, not trying to do anything.
[16822.72s -> 16829.00s]  Jax is really far up on CS, which is really good, but I'm losing it, man.
[16829.00s -> 16831.48s]  Like we see exactly where they are every game.
[16831.48s -> 16835.56s]  Like we see where everybody is on the enemy team permanently, and we still can't manage
[16835.56s -> 16838.32s]  to like walk to the right location.
[16838.32s -> 16842.46s]  This is driving me crazy.
[16842.46s -> 16847.38s]  My Karthus, my Karthus jungle is getting out farmed.
[16847.38s -> 16850.26s]  Like a Karthus jungle is getting out farmed by a Lee Sin jungle.
[16850.26s -> 16851.26s]  That's insane.
[16851.26s -> 16855.26s]  Like, I don't think I can stress enough how crazy that is.
[16855.26s -> 16865.81s]  Like, there should never be a world where Karthus ever gets outfarmed.
[16865.81s -> 16866.81s]  No way.
[16866.81s -> 16867.81s]  I'm dead.
[16867.81s -> 16871.93s]  Dude, no way I just fucking ate the end of that.
[16871.93s -> 16873.25s]  Now I'm playing bad.
[16873.25s -> 16884.60s]  Just kill the Lee Sin, man!
[16884.60s -> 16887.44s]  I fucked up there.
[16887.44s -> 16891.08s]  That was my fault, because I got hit by the tip of the- that was my fault.
[16891.08s -> 16894.20s]  I got barely clipped by the tip of the Neeko ult when I was trying to space, because I'm
[16894.20s -> 16895.20s]  bad.
[16895.20s -> 16899.08s]  And if I was alive there and I could have saved my flash for the Lee Sin Q we just win
[16899.08s -> 16905.25s]  I am confused that why we decided to like not fight that immediately though
[16906.29s -> 16911.49s]  Like we caught out two of their members and we just got scared for whatever reason wait we win this fight
[16912.21s -> 16914.21s]  We a thousand percent win this fight this fight this fight this
[16928.66s -> 16931.26s]  Bro, do not throw a fucking temper tantrum right now
[16931.86s -> 16934.84s]  There's one kill do not throw a temper tantrum. Oh
[16938.23s -> 16940.23s]  My god, here we go. I
[16940.23s -> 16943.11s]  I took one kill the guy's about to lose his mind guys. I
[16951.58s -> 16954.42s]  Need to mute all I'm gonna mute all in a second
[16955.70s -> 16963.44s]  Like I I can't with these people right now. I got cancer man. You people are disgusting
[16964.62s -> 16966.62s]  like you guys just
[16966.64s -> 16971.32s]  Wine you play bad you whine and you bitch about every little mistake that everything happens
[16971.48s -> 16973.14s]  Even though it's like in the middle of a fight
[16973.14s -> 16978.54s]  I guarantee I'm a better player than you are and you're still whining and crying over one shutdown that like
[16978.54s -> 16981.58s]  Like, you didn't even walk to until I spam pinged you.
[16981.58s -> 16985.78s]  Like, I literally 1v2'd them, you hit 1 E, and now you're mad.
[16985.78s -> 16991.09s]  Dude, I swear, League players are fucking psychopaths.
[16991.09s -> 16997.75s]  At least I got the exhaust off.
[16997.75s -> 16999.65s]  Surely she dies, right?
[16999.65s -> 17001.31s]  Surely she dies here.
[17001.31s -> 17002.31s]  Or not.
[17002.31s -> 17003.31s]  Okay.
[17003.31s -> 17006.47s]  Okay, at least she died.
[17006.47s -> 17009.07s]  Help each other, guys.
[17009.07s -> 17010.07s]  Help each other, teamwork?
[17010.07s -> 17012.96s]  Teamwork, teamwork, teamwork.
[17012.96s -> 17013.96s]  Teamwork.
[17013.96s -> 17019.47s]  Teamwork
[17019.47s -> 17021.47s]  Wait, this ash is insane
[17025.73s -> 17031.09s]  Okay, I'm not gonna lie that ash played that so good. I only saw the end of it and she still played that good
[17032.49s -> 17034.49s]  That was sick
[17034.93s -> 17037.33s]  Well, well done that was actually really good
[17038.01s -> 17041.90s]  She almost stopped the dive
[17042.14s -> 17048.82s]  That's crazy. This game is definitely
[17049.70s -> 17052.48s]  1000% still winnable though. We just have to play
[17052.48s -> 17056.60s]  Play for late game and not lose our fucking minds.
[17056.60s -> 17062.72s]  I'll let that push back into my Ashe, I'll go mid and get some vision.
[17062.72s -> 17065.16s]  That's pretty much all we have to do.
[17065.16s -> 17072.24s]  Play for late and not lose our mind early.
[17072.24s -> 17073.88s]  We could play to kill the Sakali right now.
[17073.88s -> 17077.32s]  She doesn't know, there's no ward here.
[17077.32s -> 17078.80s]  We could also invade here.
[17078.80s -> 17084.83s]  Oh, that's so unlucky.
[17084.83s -> 17091.42s]  That was such a close queue.
[17091.42s -> 17092.42s]  Kill that guy.
[17092.42s -> 17114.64s]  Jesus Christ.
[17114.64s -> 17123.59s]  I feel like we should have won that fight. I feel like something awkward happened and
[17123.59s -> 17129.35s]  we lost. Did my Ashe just walk directly into the Sakaleh and not use her ulti? Use your
[17129.35s -> 17149.49s]  ulti. You have ulti. Use your ulti. Oh my god. What the fuck? Oh my god. I don't even
[17149.49s -> 17156.25s]  know what to say right now. This is insane. This genuinely feels like everybody in the
[17156.25s -> 17164.12s]  game is losing their mind in the freest game I've ever seen in my life like
[17164.12s -> 17168.50s]  that's what we're losing to right there that guy the guy who like doesn't
[17168.50s -> 17173.30s]  understand how Senna works like that player that's why I'm frustrated like
[17173.30s -> 17179.92s]  that player right there has no idea how Senna works tries to fight me and we're
[17179.92s -> 17183.94s]  like losing to that guy like I'm trying really hard not to be an asshole but
[17183.94s -> 17186.54s]  like it's flooding out right now from these games.
[17188.26s -> 17192.64s]  It's crazy.
[17192.64s -> 17194.00s]  Like he's so toxic.
[17194.00s -> 17194.96s]  Look at this.
[17194.96s -> 17197.52s]  He went proto belt, Ionia boot,
[17199.96s -> 17201.74s]  Nico, but like, what?
[17201.74s -> 17219.22s]  That doesn't do anything to help his team.
[17219.22s -> 17220.18s]  You could arrow that guy.
[17220.18s -> 17221.72s]  I mean, it's not impossible.
[17223.58s -> 17224.94s]  Or don't, that's fine.
[17236.15s -> 17237.21s]  Oh my God.
[17243.21s -> 17248.19s]  Guys, I think my Lux is AFK.
[17248.19s -> 17256.67s]  She's been sitting in base for like five minutes.
[17256.67s -> 17261.35s]  I think she's like literally just trolling or some shits.
[17261.35s -> 17273.52s]  All right, let's push this wave.
[17273.52s -> 17280.40s]  We could make a pick right now.
[17280.40s -> 17281.88s]  Jax, what are you doing, man?
[17281.88s -> 17282.96s]  Why are you up there?
[17282.96s -> 17285.83s]  Oh no.
[17285.83s -> 17287.59s]  Also, why does this Ashe have
[17287.59s -> 17296.04s]  the worst build I've ever seen?
[17296.04s -> 17297.96s]  Dude, if we lose to the Kai'sa that just did that,
[17297.96s -> 17315.20s]  I'm gonna lose my mind.
[17315.20s -> 17316.96s]  Wait, that guy just blind art in
[17316.96s -> 17319.76s]  without any vision of anybody and just died.
[17319.76s -> 17324.66s]  There's just no way we can lose this.
[17324.66s -> 17329.25s]  We got this guys, just play.
[17329.25s -> 17330.29s]  Like I just need to,
[17330.29s -> 17333.49s]  I need help getting vision control on Baron and mid,
[17333.49s -> 17335.69s]  and then we can, we can win.
[17335.69s -> 17416.67s]  We got this, right now.
[17416.67s -> 17417.59s]  I mean, we still got Baron,
[17417.59s -> 17421.52s]  but he did get two of them, I guess.
[17421.52s -> 17423.82s]  Or no, he only, yeah, he got Karthus and Ashe.
[17424.84s -> 17433.89s]  But we did get Baron, which is very nice.
[17433.89s -> 17436.09s]  I'm gonna go Dom's this game.
[17436.09s -> 17439.85s]  Normally I go Black Cleaver,
[17439.85s -> 17457.34s]  But I think I'm gonna go Dom's I need to get vision control on dragon and min
[17457.34s -> 17473.25s]  I need to get vision control and I need I need help to do it though
[17474.37s -> 17476.37s]  I'm gonna act like I'm backing here
[17483.66s -> 17486.62s]  We should just be pushing mid with Baron. I don't know what we're doing
[17488.10s -> 17491.34s]  Like like Loki it should just be straight up like we go mid with Baron here
[17492.14s -> 17504.77s]  The fuck was that that was a terrible play
[17505.61s -> 17536.06s]  Guys, just just come mid. We have Baron nice huge pick push mid push mid
[17536.92s -> 17538.92s]  Fuck dragon, just push mid.
[17538.92s -> 17551.10s]  Okay, now we back off.
[17551.10s -> 17553.10s]  Oh, I mean that was...
[17553.10s -> 17557.44s]  bad.
[17557.44s -> 17559.44s]  Guys, back off, back off, back off, leave.
[17559.44s -> 17561.44s]  Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, please.
[17561.44s -> 17566.86s]  Please just leave.
[17566.86s -> 17568.86s]  Guys, you can leave, you can leave. We can just go do dragon.
[17568.86s -> 17573.84s]  Leave.
[17573.84s -> 17575.84s]  We still have so much gold to get on the map, we can go get bot tier 2.
[17575.84s -> 17577.84s]  Bot tier 1, bot tier 2.
[17577.84s -> 17581.84s]  We have so much gold to get on the map, it's not a big deal, right?
[17581.84s -> 17583.84s]  Like, we don't need to end the game right this second.
[17583.84s -> 17585.84s]  We actually have Karthus and we have
[17587.60s -> 17633.12s]  Jax too. So like our scaling is really good. I need to go get I need to go get
[17634.32s -> 17636.60s]  My next item, but I need enough gold to do it. I
[17638.68s -> 17640.68s]  Also need to go get wards
[17640.78s -> 17644.60s]  This sucks. I'm gonna like a weird buy timer where like I don't have enough things to get
[17645.12s -> 17647.12s]  You know what? I'm just gonna get my ward item
[17647.98s -> 17651.12s]  I'm gonna grab this for right now just so we can actually get some power on the map
[17651.12s -> 17655.68s]  Because the map is so dark and I think getting the ward item before finishing my last whisper
[17655.68s -> 17662.38s]  item is probably the smartest call.
[17662.38s -> 17668.82s]  I am a little concerned why we're not pushing bot with Jax, we're pushing top.
[17668.82s -> 17676.26s]  And I'm also concerned why we're not playing for mid prio and we're just farming bot side.
[17676.26s -> 17684.58s]  This is such an awkward fucking thing.
[17684.58s -> 17687.86s]  We should just be playing for mid prio and use arrow to engage.
[17687.86s -> 17688.86s]  That's how we win.
[17688.86s -> 17701.12s]  to engage when they contest mid. It's actually that easy. Like low key, it's actually that easy.
[17708.18s -> 17721.57s]  See? Watch, now this guy's dead. I mean, that's fine with me. You guys want to int to kill me?
[17721.57s -> 17740.34s]  That's totally fine. They can get the inhib, and then they can back up. Yeah, yeah, get inhib,
[17740.34s -> 17748.62s]  back up, and then play for Baron. They'll only have a few seconds to do this though,
[17748.62s -> 17751.26s]  So it's kind of scary because these two are gonna be alive
[17752.42s -> 17759.19s]  They need to back immediately
[17759.63s -> 17765.91s]  Just reset. You don't need the wave. Just leave leave
[17766.63s -> 17768.99s]  Baron's up, Baron's up. Think about the macro guys, the macro
[17769.83s -> 17771.51s]  We play for Baron now
[17771.51s -> 17776.70s]  Because there's a timer now where like you guys just need to reset
[17777.02s -> 17781.34s]  Because there's a timer where the enemy has tempo on the map and if we don't
[17782.66s -> 17784.66s]  If we don't allow
[17785.30s -> 17788.46s]  If we don't reset they'll just rush Baron and there's nothing we can do about it
[17788.46s -> 17802.53s]  Okay, they're not on Baron. I think they missed their timer. They're on it. No, they're on
[17802.53s -> 17813.79s]  it. They're on it. They're on it. Okay, they're not on it. We're fine. We can still fight
[17813.79s -> 17825.86s]  this though, but we need everybody here. Just arrow, arrow, arrow, arrow, arrow. It doesn't
[17825.86s -> 17837.62s]  matter if you hit mouth, just arrow. Just arrow him. Thank you. No, guys, the back line,
[17837.62s -> 17853.23s]  the back line. Play together, play together. Yes. Nice. End of the game. You end, you end
[17853.23s -> 17860.15s]  here. Lux don't back. You are giving me cancer. Okay, they forfeited. Dude, look how easy
[17860.15s -> 17865.27s]  that is. Look how easy it is to win games when people are listening to macro. Look how
[17865.27s -> 17872.41s]  easy it is. Oh my God. I'm losing it, man. I swear to God, I'm losing my, I can feel
[17872.41s -> 17876.23s]  my hair falling out right now. I can feel it falling out of my fucking head. Like,
[17876.23s -> 17878.47s]  Like, I just lost one, it's right there, look.
[17878.47s -> 17882.35s]  Like, it's just, fucking killed me, man.
[17882.35s -> 17887.35s]  In game, God, it's so hard, I feel so exhausted.
[17888.59s -> 17895.18s]  Like, it's so exhausting.
[17895.18s -> 17896.54s]  You played a 44 minute gold game?
[17896.54s -> 17903.62s]  God, damn, that's impressive.
[17903.62s -> 17905.82s]  I don't wanna honor any of these people.
[17905.82s -> 17907.06s]  Who would you guys honor?
[17907.94s -> 17909.42s]  Like, out of all of them, who'd you guys pick?
[17909.42s -> 17910.78s]  Cause I don't know, they all suck.
[17910.78s -> 17916.32s]  In my eyes, I'm too toxic right now, they all suck.
[17916.32s -> 17920.27s]  Jacks? Alright, I'll give it to Jacks.
[17920.27s -> 17922.27s]  Ash? Ash was trying, I'll give you that.
[17922.27s -> 17926.94s]  Ash was trying.
[17926.94s -> 17929.44s]  Dude, look at this Lux.
[17929.44s -> 17931.44s]  This Lux got so fucking carried.
[17931.44s -> 17939.23s]  Oh my god.
[17939.23s -> 17941.23s]  Oh my god.
[17941.23s -> 17943.23s]  Don't type to me,
[17943.23s -> 17945.23s]  you pedestrian.
[17945.23s -> 17951.59s]  This man called him a pedestrian.
[17951.59s -> 17961.72s]  That's not even an insult.
[17961.72s -> 17963.72s]  Like, oh yeah, yeah, wow.
[17963.72s -> 17965.72s]  Fucking pedestrian.
[17965.72s -> 17987.98s]  Like, that's not even an insult, man.
[17987.98s -> 17988.82s]  Dude.
[17990.10s -> 17993.30s]  Guys, I feel like part of my life gets taken away, you know?
[17993.30s -> 17996.22s]  Like when I play on my main account
[17996.22s -> 17998.42s]  and I'm like super sweaty, tryharding and shit,
[17998.42s -> 18000.46s]  I feel like I'm losing like, yeah,
[18000.46s -> 18003.18s]  it's like every time I lose, it's like one hair.
[18003.18s -> 18005.30s]  Or like every time I'm like barely win.
[18005.30s -> 18007.06s]  Right, it's just like every game in this ELO
[18007.06s -> 18010.06s]  is like one hair on my head gets fucking burnt out
[18010.06s -> 18011.06s]  and it just leaves.
[18011.06s -> 18032.65s]  And I'm gonna be looking like Homer Simpson.
[18032.65s -> 18035.13s]  Like, look at the difference in wards placed.
[18035.13s -> 18038.59s]  This is what annoys me about bad support players.
[18038.59s -> 18039.99s]  This guy placed 23.
[18041.41s -> 18043.97s]  He's more focused on getting kills than placing wards,
[18043.97s -> 18051.20s]  and it's really stupid.
[18051.20s -> 18052.44s]  Sorry, I just don't, listen,
[18052.44s -> 18054.24s]  I don't have anything against the Dog Lightning guy
[18054.24s -> 18056.14s]  as a person, other than like,
[18056.14s -> 18058.48s]  what I've seen on his stream, right?
[18058.48s -> 18062.14s]  Like, on his stream, he just seems really egotistical.
[18063.24s -> 18065.08s]  Like, he's like everything I hate
[18065.08s -> 18066.84s]  in the average league player.
[18066.84s -> 18073.80s]  He has a massive ego because he reached challenger on the support role on like an off meta pick
[18073.80s -> 18077.24s]  like last year at some point or something or maybe he's challenger right now i don't even know
[18077.80s -> 18082.60s]  maybe he has an account in challenger i don't even know but it drives me crazy because like
[18084.78s -> 18091.02s]  he doesn't do anything correctly like he gets away with such dumb shit because he like he like
[18091.02s -> 18097.02s]  basically wins lane because he plays extremely aggressively but if you guys noticed in that game
[18097.02s -> 18103.78s]  The reason we won lane or we were able to push back is because they played aggressively, but they did it really stupidly
[18104.22s -> 18106.28s]  Like they were fighting us in our own waves
[18106.98s -> 18109.56s]  Right like on repeat. They were just fighting us in our own waves
[18109.94s -> 18116.34s]  Every time I would just turn a one for one almost a one for two every time and it's it's stupid because every time that's happening
[18116.34s -> 18121.44s]  They're also giving me souls, right and he would like take weird fights and like I know he's probably for fun
[18121.44s -> 18126.08s]  And he doesn't carry it's a smurf blah blah blah, but I just don't like when people like that like ego their ass off
[18126.08s -> 18136.79s]  when they play so badly it drives me crazy why do I care so much I don't know
[18136.79s -> 18162.82s]  I don't know how you guys doing by the way how's everybody's day going in chat
[18162.82s -> 18167.10s]  what you guys up to talk to me I know I stopped like teaching the game and
[18167.10s -> 18170.54s]  started whining like I got on my main account a few hours ago and I stopped
[18170.54s -> 18180.47s]  teaching and I started whining a bunch so my bad my bad on that one dudes how
[18180.47s -> 18190.58s]  you guys doing though how's everybody's day going when's the coaching services
[18190.58s -> 18198.42s]  open oh i could probably do coaching at some point soon like i'd be willing to do some coaching some
[18198.42s -> 18212.56s]  like sub coaching or something or like something like that it might be fun sucking in bronze you
[18212.56s -> 18216.40s]  don't get enough time to actually improve dude i feel that man it takes a long time league is not
[18216.40s -> 18221.44s]  an easy game to pick up and start playing right like if you're if you're in bronze or silver and
[18221.44s -> 18224.24s]  you're like oh i actually you know i'm having fun playing the game i kind of want to try and get
[18224.24s -> 18228.96s]  better it's you're just overwhelmed with so much info that you like have to play so many games
[18229.76s -> 18231.76s]  Right, like, I feel you, man.
[18231.76s -> 18236.99s]  Like, it's overwhelming.
[18236.99s -> 18246.96s]  Yeah, I feel you.
[18246.96s -> 18257.06s]  Well, we got mid.
[18257.06s -> 18259.06s]  Okay.
[18259.06s -> 18263.20s]  Should I just play Trist?
[18263.20s -> 18265.20s]  Well, I'm worried if I pick Trist that we won't have
[18265.20s -> 18267.20s]  AP, but
[18267.20s -> 18269.20s]  I also think I'm better at Trist than I am at, like,
[18269.20s -> 18271.20s]  other stuff.
[18271.20s -> 18279.63s]  So, I don't know.
[18279.63s -> 18281.63s]  AP Varus?
[18281.63s -> 18283.63s]  I'm not good enough at AP Varus, man.
[18283.63s -> 18287.84s]  I'm gonna be real.
[18287.84s -> 18291.12s]  My Malz is good, but the problem with Malz is like Malz is a shitty champion
[18292.00s -> 18294.00s]  Like Malz is trash, right? So like
[18295.52s -> 18299.84s]  He's good, but he's like not good in the sense of like I can play him well
[18300.72s -> 18303.20s]  but at the end of the day if they pick something that like
[18304.32s -> 18306.32s]  Counters Malz I just lose
[18308.94s -> 18310.94s]  Whereas like Tristana is just free to pick
[18312.06s -> 18314.06s]  Like even if we play all ad
[18314.06s -> 18318.38s]  Right, let's say we do all ad or some shit like on accident or because people are one tricks blah blah blah
[18318.38s -> 18325.98s]  It's it's still free like Tristana is still like a good pick because even with all ad she's still like you can build Lord Dom's
[18326.62s -> 18331.48s]  She has incredibly high pressure early game if you play her right right now, you could push the waves roam
[18332.06s -> 18337.18s]  You can you can roam top roam bot help lanes out like level 2 3 you can invade junglers early
[18337.34s -> 18342.73s]  Like she's just incredibly incredibly strong. This guy should go pike. I
[18343.89s -> 18349.33s]  Was gonna say they pick Nunu and I picked an ad mid they picked Nunu and Thresh
[18349.89s -> 18351.89s]  We should have an engage
[18351.89s -> 18353.89s]  Cause, cause Pyke, Trist
[18353.89s -> 18357.89s]  Like I can just walk bot on repeat now and pretty much kill people
[18357.89s -> 18375.75s]  Watch an Iron game? Watching an Iron game, I feel like it wouldn't be an actual Iron game though would it?
[18375.75s -> 18379.75s]  I've heard, I had friends who like intentionally lost a bunch of games
[18379.75s -> 18381.75s]  Uh
[18381.75s -> 18386.75s]  And so they could get to Iron 4, right? They like, they like inted down to Iron 4 or whatever
[18386.75s -> 18388.75s]  To see if they could make it
[18388.75s -> 18390.75s]  And
[18390.75s -> 18398.83s]  uh there's just so many like smurfs in iron there's like legitimate bot bot accounts
[18400.67s -> 18405.39s]  like like accounts that are like being botted right there's like botted accounts in iron
[18405.39s -> 18419.02s]  there's like smurfs all over the place it seems to have stopped i wonder if riot like did something
[18419.02s -> 18424.30s]  that stopped the bots they must they may have like they may have just incorporated something
[18424.30s -> 18432.30s]  that like stops the software but i don't know i haven't heard anything about it but
[18432.30s -> 18434.86s]  but I have no clue.
[18434.86s -> 18460.15s]  I'll be real, I don't know.
[18460.15s -> 18462.29s]  You had to take foggy run last game, I got boots one.
[18462.29s -> 18463.13s]  Boom.
[18463.13s -> 18469.13s]  Dude, that sounds awful.
[18469.13s -> 18472.29s]  I kind of feel bad for actual Iron players
[18472.29s -> 18476.15s]  who are like in Iron trying to climb
[18476.15s -> 18492.84s]  because like that sounds bad.
[18492.84s -> 18494.82s]  I do think you can climb obviously out of any ELO,
[18494.82s -> 18495.74s]  it doesn't matter, right?
[18495.74s -> 18497.08s]  Like if I were to go into an Iron game,
[18497.08s -> 18500.86s]  I'd probably drop like 50 kills.
[18500.86s -> 18504.70s]  But I so I do think you can climb out of any you know any elo for sure
[18519.50s -> 18523.74s]  You love on your new account if you guys had a bot account that answered every time I wrote bot
[18530.78s -> 18539.75s]  That's funny
[18539.75s -> 18541.43s]  Yeah, I assume that's a good point
[18541.43s -> 18542.79s]  I guess if you're in iron
[18542.79s -> 18547.11s]  You could like play to learn the game a bit better and then you could like play a new account and see where you got
[18547.75s -> 18549.75s]  Yeah, I know that would work
[18549.91s -> 18557.08s]  That makes sense
[18557.08s -> 18559.00s]  Sure. I'll first pick men
[18559.00s -> 18563.06s]  I'll first pick senna
[18563.06s -> 18566.50s]  I- I- I guarantee they lock in fucking...
[18566.50s -> 18570.86s]  These people are gonna lock in fucking, uh, Nautilus or some shits.
[18570.86s -> 18574.86s]  It'll be like Jarvan, Nautilus...
[18574.86s -> 18576.62s]  Uh...
[18576.62s -> 18583.08s]  I don't even know.
[18583.08s -> 18585.92s]  Riven's not too bad, but it's okay, it's okay to get flanked.
[18585.92s -> 18587.92s]  I actually don't think Riven's too bad right now.
[18587.92s -> 18592.16s]  Maybe all the Riven players I've played against suck, but I- I don't think she's actually that bad.
[18592.16s -> 18594.96s]  I think Riven's, like, just, you have to position well.
[18594.96s -> 18600.24s]  I think Riven's really broken at abusing positioning, that's why she's so good in solo queue
[18600.80s -> 18604.16s]  Like, good Riven players will get really gross flanks
[18604.64s -> 18607.36s]  And the flanks are what's OP- yeah, there's the Gragas, okay
[18607.36s -> 18609.52s]  I was like, they're gonna pick something to fuck me over
[18611.46s -> 18615.06s]  This guy picked Gragas, but it was gonna be like J4 or Gragas or something
[18616.10s -> 18618.66s]  And then this guy is the support, he'll probably pick Nautilus
[18620.18s -> 18621.46s]  Unless he's a one-trick
[18622.42s -> 18626.46s]  Right, like unless this guy's straight up just like a one trick he'll pick like Nautilus or some shits
[18629.16s -> 18631.16s]  Maybe Rakan, Rakan or Nautilus
[18635.20s -> 18642.85s]  Cuz if he picks an enchanter, we just win the game. He has to pick engage
[18647.36s -> 18649.48s]  Melio would be really good here too, actually
[18650.80s -> 18656.68s]  Cuz Melio would counter half our team. You can Melio Q Wukong and Kennen engage
[18658.40s -> 18661.08s]  Like if this guy played Melio, this would actually be a hard lane
[18661.08s -> 18670.81s]  Tom Kinch? I mean, I get it, but I think it's bad.
[18673.05s -> 18674.61s]  Runes, oh shit.
[18675.55s -> 18679.47s]  Yo, you just saved me looking like an absolute fool.
[18679.47s -> 18680.31s]  Thank you.
[18681.69s -> 18682.63s]  Holy crap.
[18682.63s -> 18683.95s]  If you wanted to see my runes, they're here,
[18683.95s -> 18684.91s]  but thank you, you reminded me.
[18684.91s -> 18686.51s]  Here, I'm gonna be right back, I'm gonna get some water.
[18686.51s -> 18687.91s]  I'll be right back.
[18687.91s -> 18728.81s]  Get some agua.
[18728.81s -> 18729.77s]  By the way, the people who are here
[18729.77s -> 18734.21s]  to watch me play AD Carry, I sincerely apologize.
[18734.21s -> 18743.44s]  I know watching me play Senna is probably boring as fuck. Okay, I know
[18744.52s -> 18749.30s]  And I promise you we will play ad carry at some point. I promise you
[18749.30s -> 18753.96s]  I played like the first four hours of the stream was ad carry or the first three, right?
[18753.96s -> 18755.82s]  I put on my smurf for a few games and played some ad
[18755.82s -> 18759.24s]  So if you want to watch that you can go back in the bot. We did some my commentary and shit
[18761.26s -> 18765.30s]  The only reason I'm playing so much Senna and support on this account is because like
[18765.30s -> 18772.18s]  Like, the ELO I'm currently in is like the worst ELO to climb in solo queue because of
[18772.18s -> 18779.78s]  a lot of factors and support has some of the highest impact on the game.
[18779.78s -> 18783.70s]  Whereas like AD Carry has high impact late, but in solo queue you want to have high impact
[18783.70s -> 18810.34s]  early and I wanted to be able to impact the game really early on.
[18810.34s -> 18820.82s]  So yeah, sorry about being, you know, boring and shit.
[18820.82s -> 18825.50s]  I just really want to like win games, at least on this account.
[18825.50s -> 18841.66s]  I want to get out of the silo, because the faster I get out of the silo, the faster,
[18841.66s -> 18847.22s]  the faster I get out of the silo, the faster I can have fun playing AD carry and like try
[18847.22s -> 18849.78s]  and climb.
[18849.78s -> 18853.58s]  What a weird, like what a weird play by these guys.
[18853.58s -> 18854.94s]  What the fuck?
[18854.94s -> 18861.08s]  They like half shoved the waves to get like early bush control.
[18861.08s -> 18872.51s]  And then they do shit like that.
[18872.51s -> 18873.35s]  This guy's just dead.
[18873.35s -> 18878.66s]  I'm gonna give it to Twitch.
[18878.66s -> 18880.42s]  Nice, we got his exhaust.
[18880.42s -> 18881.98s]  So I wasted my exhaust there.
[18881.98s -> 18883.54s]  I did it because I thought the Jinx
[18883.54s -> 18884.98s]  was gonna insta-flash.
[18886.78s -> 18887.62s]  Like, I didn't exhaust it
[18887.62s -> 18889.64s]  because I was like scared of her damage.
[18889.64s -> 18891.44s]  I did it because I thought she was gonna like,
[18891.44s -> 18893.74s]  try and flash away the second that's...
[18895.26s -> 18896.78s]  But I landed my snare.
[18896.78s -> 18897.70s]  It was kind of bad by me.
[18897.70s -> 18899.78s]  I mean, I landed my snare so I didn't need to exhaust her.
[18899.78s -> 18902.06s]  I just was like, oh, maybe she'll flash.
[18902.06s -> 18902.90s]  She did not.
[18902.90s -> 18913.04s]  not flash what do you know is this this 500 lp masters 400 lp it's insane i know absolutely
[18913.04s -> 18949.36s]  crazy put that ward there because gragas is probably bot yeah so they're trying to come
[18949.36s -> 18959.38s]  up from bot to kill me here like they're bot lanes rotating up to try and kill me so just
[18959.38s -> 18962.80s]  Just be careful Twitch, they're in here man.
[18962.80s -> 18972.98s]  I actually have to back and walk, look.
[18972.98s -> 18973.98s]  This is hilarious.
[18973.98s -> 18976.18s]  The enemy bot lane literally is just roaming mid.
[18976.18s -> 18977.18s]  Look at this.
[18977.18s -> 18978.18s]  What?
[18978.18s -> 18981.06s]  Why?
[18981.06s -> 18991.11s]  I'm not trying to soak his XP, I just want those souls.
[18991.11s -> 19006.09s]  I'm scared to walk in here, I don't know where Gragas is.
[19006.09s -> 19008.69s]  I gotta come bot to help my Twitch so they don't freeze the wave.
[19008.69s -> 19016.14s]  Like I don't want them to be able to freeze here.
[19016.14s -> 19020.69s]  Even if Gragas ganks, we win the fight right now.
[19020.69s -> 19024.49s]  It's an easy fight win as long as you don't get knocked up. We just win the fight automatically
[19032.30s -> 19035.10s]  Actually, we're trying to bait Gragas to come gank this
[19043.38s -> 19044.70s]  easy
[19044.70s -> 19046.70s]  double flashes, baby easy
[19047.86s -> 19053.34s]  You fucking cowards
[19053.42s -> 19066.32s]  We should back up
[19066.32s -> 19069.04s]  Like I can go buy now Oh Greg is the top
[19069.64s -> 19071.64s]  We could actually maybe do dragon
[19071.88s -> 19078.40s]  Yeah, I'm gonna be real a soul roaming is not a not in like the top list of me being like nervous about it
[19078.40s -> 19086.50s]  Like, I'm not nervous about Aesol roaming, man.
[19086.50s -> 19089.00s]  Push this so we can, oh, we're diving them?
[19090.06s -> 19090.98s]  That's a bit scary.
[19090.98s -> 19094.50s]  Welcome to the League of Draven.
[19094.50s -> 19097.26s]  Good to see you're back to enjoying the game.
[19097.26s -> 19098.86s]  Whoa, Wukong's still diving that?
[19098.86s -> 19100.50s]  That's not good.
[19100.50s -> 19107.16s]  Like, we back off here, man.
[19107.16s -> 19115.54s]  I mean, we can maybe go up here if you really want to.
[19115.54s -> 19123.54s]  I kind of want to ward this.
[19123.54s -> 19130.55s]  I need to reset, though, really badly right now.
[19130.55s -> 19131.55s]  Like, really badly.
[19133.23s -> 19135.53s]  Not being on the map here is really bad
[19136.95s -> 19138.95s]  Or rather not like having
[19139.27s -> 19142.25s]  Gold spent and being on the map is what I'm gonna say like it's really fucking bad
[19143.07s -> 19146.77s]  Yo back up, you know Greg is that you watched him walk past three wards
[19148.03s -> 19150.59s]  That's why I just warded. No, no, he's still here
[19151.43s -> 19153.43s]  Ragas is right there
[19154.27s -> 19165.05s]  Like we know Greg is is somewhere bot lane right now, I don't know where but we know he's there they're on dragon, okay
[19166.01s -> 19168.01s]  We can fight this go go go
[19168.33s -> 19186.63s]  W over I'm here. Nice. Yo, come here
[19188.13s -> 19191.13s]  Y'all help you come get this blue. I
[19192.91s -> 19211.05s]  Got you, baby
[19211.05s -> 19220.28s]  What the fuck made a bitch?
[19221.36s -> 19228.96s]  Well, I guess I'll back
[19230.10s -> 19232.96s]  Yo Spartan, thank you for the six months man. Welcome back
[19233.92s -> 19235.92s]  Appreciate it
[19235.92s -> 19238.64s]  Yes, we'll back we'll get our fucking umbral
[19239.98s -> 19241.98s]  I'm gonna go top side of the map now
[19242.64s -> 19244.80s]  And I'm gonna help my team get rift heralds
[19245.62s -> 19248.52s]  I'm gonna ping I want to go top side. I want to help my team get rifts
[19249.16s -> 19259.30s]  The wave if we look at bot wave it's pushing into us. It's totally fine
[19260.18s -> 19262.18s]  Okay, twitch is level 6
[19263.60s -> 19274.95s]  The bot waves pushing in we are totally fine to do what I'm doing right now. He doesn't know I'm here
[19275.63s -> 19293.25s]  I'm dead though
[19293.25s -> 19296.79s]  Bro
[19296.79s -> 19299.01s]  No joke. I almost juked that
[19300.27s -> 19305.47s]  That's so close. I was hoping like wukong for some reason didn't walk topside
[19306.67s -> 19308.67s]  But the enemy bot lane did
[19313.01s -> 19316.35s]  Okay, the enemy bot lane just griefed their entire game. The game's over we win
[19316.95s -> 19319.55s]  What the fuck are they doing? What is happening?
[19320.23s -> 19323.93s]  Like my twitch is just getting free plates
[19329.86s -> 19331.86s]  Wait, you guys are griefing
[19332.22s -> 19341.74s]  I'm griefing
[19341.74s -> 19343.74s]  Dude, what the fuck?
[19343.90s -> 19348.76s]  We why would you fight them guys guys guys wukong?
[19350.02s -> 19351.38s]  wukong
[19351.38s -> 19356.98s]  Okay, we see that our twitch is getting free plates bot free first turret. Okay, I'm backed
[19356.98s -> 19362.46s]  I almost soloed their ad carry. Okay, or their jungler. Why would you ever on?
[19363.22s -> 19369.10s]  Purpose take a for a fight like that with no. Oh, I have cancer. I
[19369.10s -> 19371.10s]  I also
[19371.38s -> 19376.18s]  The Wukong's an idiot. He doesn't understand macro at all apparently because I literally
[19376.70s -> 19380.10s]  Pinged to come to rift my Wukong was like nervous
[19383.04s -> 19389.08s]  Like for some reason Wukong didn't walk top. He sat bot trying to gank but the objective was rift not
[19391.30s -> 19394.70s]  God I'm losing my mind in this elo. Masters players are
[19394.70s -> 19400.18s]  are literally just diamond players with slightly better mechanics. They don't know anything
[19400.18s -> 19406.06s]  about the game and I'm about to- my brain's about to explode like a peanut. It's not about
[19406.06s -> 19412.88s]  them laning 2v2 you fucking kumquat. Dude I know they can't lane against us 2v2. It's
[19412.88s -> 19417.88s]  not about the 2v2 man. We get a free rift herald because we shut down their bot lane
[19417.88s -> 19422.80s]  and I'm on an item spike. So we just automatically get a free rift. It has nothing to do with
[19422.80s -> 19436.85s]  2v2. This kumquat motherfucker. I don't know why that's my insult. The pedestrian guy got
[19436.85s -> 19458.02s]  to me. Somehow. Where the fuck is this ward? Oh. Cause I'm telling you right now, my macro
[19458.02s -> 19473.47s]  there was 100% correct by the way, like 1000%. Like even though I died, I know it was correct.
[19473.47s -> 19478.59s]  No! No, just do dragon. Do not dive. Guys, we don't have to- not everything's about kills,
[19478.59s -> 19480.03s]  everything's about kills. We got this.
[19481.31s -> 19483.07s]  Like, you don't need to dive. You don't need to dive always.
[19483.07s -> 19484.29s]  You don't need to see a kill and be like,
[19484.29s -> 19485.97s]  ooh, monkey, kill, brain, go.
[19486.39s -> 19489.89s]  Like, the game is about, like, getting objectives on timers
[19489.89s -> 19492.51s]  and playing off of tempo and things like that.
[19493.09s -> 19496.39s]  Like, the only reason we even lost Rift was because my Wukong
[19496.69s -> 19499.73s]  went full monkey brain and was like, no, we need to not play
[19499.73s -> 19502.17s]  for this Rift with a giant, massive lead.
[19522.56s -> 19523.44s]  Wait, kill this guy.
[19528.63s -> 19529.91s]  What am I watching right now?
[19531.89s -> 19535.21s]  This is outrageous. My Wukong just solo ulted their...
[19535.21s -> 19537.73s]  Dude, I'm gonna lose it. My Wukong just solo ulted
[19537.73s -> 19550.74s]  their Gragas. On a good note, though,
[19552.02s -> 19554.94s]  they don't get any plates off of rifting, so it's not that bad.
[19556.58s -> 19558.78s]  Okay, man. Just push. Like, dude, hit the minions.
[19558.78s -> 19559.78s]  Like, stop.
[19561.87s -> 19562.87s]  My bad.
[19563.79s -> 19566.31s]  Sorry. I'm wound up right now, Kennen. Okay?
[19566.75s -> 19567.75s]  I'm a little wound.
[19568.31s -> 19570.51s]  Apologies if I griefed you, man.
[19572.39s -> 19573.39s]  It's fine.
[19574.43s -> 19576.43s]  Sort of wound up it's fine. I
[19576.95s -> 19582.79s]  Just don't like when like stuff like that happens. I'm a perfectionist and it's my big like I talked about this earlier
[19582.79s -> 19586.03s]  I'm a perfectionist. My biggest flaw is that like I will
[19587.11s -> 19590.35s]  Play the game a hundred percent correctly on like tempo and timers
[19590.35s -> 19594.83s]  But you can't do that because you got to remember to like your teammates or teammates
[19598.34s -> 19601.94s]  Like they're not just gonna instantly know exactly what you're what what to do
[19601.94s -> 19619.17s]  We win the guy don't just stand here and watch me die man. Holy shit
[19623.43s -> 19628.09s]  That is oh my god, if he if he had let me die there I might have screamed
[19629.29s -> 19631.73s]  Actually screamed out loud in anger
[19634.93s -> 19639.01s]  like dude is watching me kite these people within one inch of my life and
[19639.89s -> 19642.65s]  Instead of like helping or walking up and doing anything. You know what he does
[19645.13s -> 19647.13s]  He pulls a fucking gross score
[19647.13s -> 19652.11s]  My man just likes to watch.
[19652.11s -> 19655.11s]  There's nothing wrong with it, but, you know, there's a time and a place.
[19655.11s -> 19675.08s]  I don't actually want to buy pinks, because I don't think we're strong enough that, uh...
[19675.08s -> 19679.08s]  I don't think that we're strong enough that I can actually even defend the pinks right now, if I'm being honest.
[19679.08s -> 19684.08s]  Like, we should be strong enough, but we kind of threw our lead when I overforced the rift.
[19684.08s -> 19692.08s]  So, I th-ing... I think...
[19692.08s -> 19699.88s]  We need to push this wave so that we can get tempo and move around the map.
[19699.88s -> 19711.80s]  on the map. Pryo. Sorry, I keep saying the wrong thing. Uh oh. That guy's dead. I have to ditch
[19711.80s -> 19719.48s]  that guy. He's dead as fuck. Oh, I'm dead too, maybe? Oh, I am so dead. Yeah, that was my bad.
[19720.44s -> 19728.78s]  That was my bad. My bad, my bad. Like, we just got ran down. That was on me. Like, we had
[19729.34s -> 19737.66s]  good positioning, but the jungler wasn't close enough. So, this is my bad. I also didn't expect
[19737.66s -> 19745.77s]  to get fucking four mans but i should have right we should play for this though i wish i could type
[19745.77s -> 19751.77s]  i wish i wasn't chat restricted for a year dude i swear to god i'm not even being mean
[19752.81s -> 19757.69s]  like riot was like they chat restricted me because i type so much macro that it gets on
[19757.69s -> 19767.77s]  people's nerves and they don't want me spam typing low key don't play don't play for rifts
[19767.77s -> 19780.67s]  I need help guys if you guys can help
[19781.87s -> 19798.99s]  We need to clear vision on dragon a year. Yeah, I get uncharted starts at April 15th or April
[19799.55s -> 19801.55s]  11th or some shit
[19801.99s -> 19803.99s]  2024
[19804.11s -> 19808.35s]  I've never seen it. It must have been like an actual rioter or something
[19808.59s -> 19812.03s]  Like I've never seen an automated system give you a year chat restricts, right?
[19812.47s -> 19815.03s]  so in my mind, it's got to be like an actual like
[19815.03s -> 19823.34s]  Like a rioter was like Geronimo, we know you're good enough to climb, but stop typing.
[19823.34s -> 19825.62s]  You know what I mean?
[19825.62s -> 19833.57s]  That's like what must have been going on.
[19833.57s -> 19852.16s]  And I'm like, okay, well, sure.
[19852.16s -> 19854.98s]  I mean, I didn't even know you could get chat banned a year.
[19854.98s -> 19857.40s]  What's weird is like I said, I don't like say trigger words.
[19857.40s -> 19860.52s]  It's not like I tell people to like end themselves and stuff.
[19860.52s -> 19865.76s]  It's mainly just me typing, like, go here, do that, do this, like I type a lot, right?
[19865.76s -> 19873.34s]  Which is obviously like, if you type a lot it can be toxic as well, so.
[19873.34s -> 19886.69s]  Like typing a lot is annoying, so I get it.
[19886.69s -> 19891.03s]  We should be playing for Baron side vision right now, not...
[19891.03s -> 19894.61s]  The vision we're playing with right now is bad, we should be playing over here.
[19894.61s -> 19899.41s]  Like, I want to play for Baron vision, but it's a little hard to do that right now.
[19899.41s -> 19907.64s]  Cause you see how Tahm Kench and me are like transferring vision control around the map
[19907.64s -> 19908.64s]  right now?
[19908.64s -> 19916.58s]  We're playing this little support game of like hide the vision look at this fuck look at this motherfucker
[19931.12s -> 19952.73s]  Oh, he's so dumb. I still think he's dumb. How did I just take?
[19958.59s -> 19960.59s]  tonight I
[19960.63s -> 19962.63s]  Took my entire HP bar on a global
[19964.66s -> 19965.94s]  my bad
[19965.94s -> 19968.72s]  Dude, I really wish the Malphite would group though. I
[19969.80s -> 19975.96s]  Get that he's like doing the thing where he's like, oh, let's you know split like his play was actually really smart there
[19976.56s -> 19980.60s]  The Malphite's play I mean like that wasn't his fault that we got shit on at all
[19980.60s -> 19985.48s]  I just wish that he would group because if he groups up and hits our we win every team fight
[19986.32s -> 19991.28s]  Cuz right now our only frontliner is the Wukong right and the fact that Wukong's our frontliner
[19991.28s -> 19993.28s]  We don't have the ability to play the game
[19993.28s -> 19996.20s]  Why did I get stuck on that?
[19996.20s -> 19998.52s]  What the fuck was that?
[19998.52s -> 20003.56s]  Like that Tom Kinch getting to E forward like that blindly into our entire team and
[20003.56s -> 20008.30s]  then not getting punished for it might be the most like solo queue thing I've ever seen.
[20008.30s -> 20014.28s]  Nobody wanted to hit him because he was the tank, but uh, yeah, that's, we should still
[20014.28s -> 20015.28s]  kill him.
[20015.28s -> 20022.33s]  You know, we can fight this guy.
[20022.33s -> 20023.33s]  Oh my God.
[20023.33s -> 20024.33s]  Jungler, just come.
[20024.33s -> 20025.33s]  Oh, we're forfeiting.
[20025.33s -> 20026.33s]  Oh, okay.
[20026.33s -> 20028.17s]  Oh, okay. Now, that makes perfect sense, right?
[20030.37s -> 20031.41s]  Just come group.
[20031.91s -> 20034.65s]  Bro, Kennen, come group. Please, guys.
[20035.15s -> 20037.25s]  Like, I don't know why everybody's frustrated.
[20037.25s -> 20038.91s]  We're literally still up in gold.
[20039.65s -> 20041.95s]  Please come group up. We just took an inhibitor.
[20042.75s -> 20044.19s]  Just, just come group.
[20045.83s -> 20048.03s]  Help me get Vision on this dragon so that I don't,
[20048.03s -> 20048.99s]  so we don't die.
[20049.59s -> 20051.93s]  Like, I need my team to actually walk over here
[20051.93s -> 20052.93s]  to help me get Vision.
[20055.08s -> 20057.68s]  It's really frustrating because I need the frontliners
[20057.68s -> 20063.04s]  is the Wukong and the Malphite to walk in with me because I'm a little fucking well I have a big
[20063.04s -> 20068.08s]  gun but I'm a big gun girl right so I need I need these two guys to walk in with me these two big
[20068.08s -> 20080.12s]  burly mountain men so that I can play the game you know no we don't push bot no no no no no no no no
[20080.12s -> 20085.48s]  mid no bot is worthless come mid my Malphite's pushing the wave that we already have down
[20086.36s -> 20091.32s]  I wish I could macro I wish I could type some macro right now they're they're like well my
[20091.32s -> 20095.12s]  My team is so lost.
[20095.12s -> 20099.29s]  They are so beyond lost right now, it's crazy.
[20099.29s -> 20109.04s]  They're lost as shit.
[20109.04s -> 20111.14s]  Just do dragon, guys, just do this.
[20111.14s -> 20113.34s]  I'll start it for you, here you go.
[20113.34s -> 20114.70s]  I don't know why we're standing in a bush
[20114.70s -> 20116.22s]  waiting for them to face check.
[20116.22s -> 20122.26s]  Do dragon, guys.
[20122.26s -> 20124.88s]  I swear to God, you have to do everything in this ELO
[20124.88s -> 20127.26s]  where you have to start every fight.
[20127.26s -> 20130.18s]  Basically, I have to start every fight, right?
[20130.18s -> 20131.82s]  I have to not only start every fight,
[20131.82s -> 20134.58s]  but I have to ping my team what to do exactly
[20134.58s -> 20137.76s]  because everybody plays so safe in this ELO.
[20137.76s -> 20140.14s]  Why did my Malphite just stop his back?
[20141.84s -> 20147.61s]  Why are you all fighting?
[20147.61s -> 20153.11s]  Oh my God, please guys.
[20153.11s -> 20155.53s]  It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[20155.53s -> 20157.73s]  No, Malphite, you can't 1v9 that.
[20157.73s -> 20158.85s]  Just back off.
[20158.85s -> 20159.77s]  They didn't get anything.
[20159.77s -> 20161.57s]  They didn't get anything, we got dragon.
[20161.57s -> 20163.01s]  We're on dragon soul points.
[20164.89s -> 20166.61s]  I'm losing hairs.
[20166.61s -> 20167.97s]  I'm losing fucking hairs, man.
[20167.97s -> 20170.27s]  I ain't got many hairs to spare anymore.
[20170.27s -> 20177.54s]  We're out here losing hair.
[20177.54s -> 20178.50s]  It's like I'm babysitting,
[20178.50s -> 20180.02s]  like this has gotta be what a preschool teacher
[20180.02s -> 20181.64s]  feels like, you know?
[20181.64s -> 20183.14s]  Like low key.
[20183.14s -> 20185.28s]  Like preschool teacher just feels like this.
[20185.28s -> 20191.58s]  This has to be it.
[20191.58s -> 20193.12s]  Like it's like watching a toddler,
[20193.12s -> 20194.98s]  like you watch them from the corner, right?
[20194.98s -> 20196.58s]  And they're like eating glue.
[20196.58s -> 20198.90s]  And you're like, I mean that's bad.
[20198.90s -> 20200.38s]  And then you tell them like, don't eat glue, Jimmy.
[20200.38s -> 20201.56s]  Don't eat glue, Timmy.
[20201.56s -> 20202.78s]  And he's like, okay.
[20202.78s -> 20204.40s]  And then like you leave him there for five minutes
[20204.40s -> 20206.70s]  to go like do something, to watch somebody else.
[20206.70s -> 20208.34s]  Then all of a sudden, Timmy's eating glue again.
[20208.34s -> 20210.06s]  And you're like, bro.
[20210.06s -> 20223.27s]  Bro we just had this discussion and it's like not Timmy's fault right because he's a toddler
[20224.63s -> 20229.43s]  so you can't be mad at Timmy because he's a toddler you can't but it's like it's frustrating
[20229.43s -> 20245.32s]  it's like god damn it man like what is what is happening like Malphite just group my Malphite
[20245.32s -> 20255.16s]  has a fetish with just pushing bot bro just group and hit R bro I know you have Bork wait you have
[20255.16s -> 20255.66s]  BORK?
[20257.82s -> 20258.32s]  Wha- I-
[20260.74s -> 20262.50s]  Bro, we need- we need to be able to engage.
[20262.50s -> 20263.50s]  We don't win through split.
[20264.70s -> 20266.06s]  Just group up, hit R, and we win.
[20267.74s -> 20270.74s]  Like, I've been controlling the ever-living fuck out of all the vision this game.
[20271.42s -> 20273.82s]  I feel like I'm doing all of this to control vision and shit,
[20274.22s -> 20275.82s]  and it- it still feels like it's not enough.
[20276.82s -> 20277.66s]  It's kinda nuts.
[20281.17s -> 20282.65s]  Lowkey, it- it still feels...
[20282.89s -> 20283.61s]  not enough.
[20289.99s -> 20293.03s]  No, don't go bot, don't go bot, don't go bot, don't go bot, please don't go bot.
[20294.87s -> 20295.43s]  Hit me!
[20295.43s -> 20306.59s]  They don't have a ward, they don't know I'm there.
[20306.59s -> 20322.38s]  What, we're just not gonna ult that guy or what?
[20322.38s -> 20326.14s]  This is why we listen.
[20326.14s -> 20331.18s]  Oh my god, I have, I actually just, I'm so, I don't know what to say.
[20331.18s -> 20336.66s]  Like I literally pinged to come, Wukong didn't use ulti, Twitch just died in, and now he's
[20336.66s -> 20337.66s]  AFK.
[20337.66s -> 20340.02s]  Oh my god, oh my god, kill me in game.
[20340.02s -> 20342.02s]  Kennen and Malphite, can you guys do anything?
[20351.21s -> 20353.99s]  Bro, can we can we like just go in cannon just ulti
[20377.45s -> 20381.95s]  Okay, guys, we get we get baron here. Look the enemy team through go to baron

[20384.83s -> 20386.79s]  Please go baron
[20386.79s -> 20388.23s]  please
[20388.23s -> 20402.61s]  We get soul and baron here, dude. I swear to God these people are not real
[20403.39s -> 20408.94s]  Bro, we do not need the malphite. I
[20410.18s -> 20412.18s]  Am a higher level than my jungler
[20416.44s -> 20418.68s]  Push mid guys. You got to push mid first
[20419.38s -> 20426.01s]  Listen homies, you gotta push mid first.
[20426.01s -> 20427.01s]  You know what?
[20427.01s -> 20428.01s]  Fuck it.
[20428.01s -> 20429.01s]  Don't even go in.
[20429.01s -> 20430.01s]  Yeah.
[20430.01s -> 20431.01s]  Fuck it.
[20431.01s -> 20432.01s]  Push mid.
[20432.01s -> 20433.01s]  We're just gonna end the game.
[20433.01s -> 20434.01s]  If they go for dragon here, we just push.
[20434.01s -> 20439.01s]  Fuck it.
[20439.01s -> 20440.69s]  That's actually such a good macro call.
[20440.69s -> 20454.56s]  Not even joking.
[20454.56s -> 20461.90s]  Such a good macro call actually.
[20461.90s -> 20462.90s]  Everybody just run though.
[20462.90s -> 20463.90s]  Just run.
[20463.90s -> 20465.62s]  No, don't ulti in.
[20465.62s -> 20466.62s]  No, guys.
[20466.62s -> 20467.62s]  We don't fight this.
[20467.62s -> 20470.42s]  Oh, I have cancer.
[20470.42s -> 20472.34s]  We're getting flanked, boys.
[20472.34s -> 20475.86s]  Dude, I have such high levels of cancer right now. You have no idea
[20476.78s -> 20479.38s]  Like I I fucking functioning cancer
[20480.30s -> 20520.05s]  And you guys just kill the fucking Gragas. Oh my god. Thank god. Thank god. Just end the game
[20520.97s -> 20524.53s]  Please end the game. Please hit the fucking thing. Oh, oh
[20526.01s -> 20529.91s]  My god, Walter White is like my hero right now
[20529.91s -> 20536.79s]  I don't even understand like I feel like every like I feel like what Walter White felt like dealing with Skylar
[20536.95s -> 20539.03s]  For literally three years like this is outrageous
[20540.31s -> 20550.97s]  This is what this feels like like I do I I can relate to the show so much more. Oh my god, like dude
[20550.97s -> 20576.72s]  I oh, oh crap
[20578.56s -> 20582.68s]  There to look at just look at the like look at like what's going on in the game
[20582.68s -> 20593.46s]  Like, I don't even mean to be mean about this. It's just, this is crazy.
[20593.46s -> 20610.87s]  Malphite, though, popping off. Malphite popping off. Like, what hero is this guy?
[20610.87s -> 20622.46s]  Oh, he's literally Diamond. Why is this guy in this game? I mean, I feel, I feel, like,
[20622.46s -> 20626.62s]  confused now. I'm not even blaming the Wukong anymore. I don't know why this guy is in the
[20626.62s -> 20638.67s]  game. Oh, he has Inflated-ass MMR. Oh, he just has Previous Season Inflated MMR. That's what this
[20638.67s -> 20641.11s]  since, because he was GM for three years.
[20642.21s -> 20644.77s]  So the his MMR says that he like belongs here,
[20644.77s -> 20646.65s]  even though he doesn't play like I bet you last season,
[20646.65s -> 20650.74s]  he only played like 50 games.
[20650.74s -> 20651.88s]  I can look right.
[20651.88s -> 20653.78s]  We just see like how many games he played.
[20653.78s -> 20656.64s]  Yeah, he played he played like 50 games last season.
[20656.64s -> 20658.24s]  So like his MMR didn't really change.
[20658.24s -> 20660.08s]  He just got masters and then stopped.
[20661.18s -> 20662.02s]  Which is fine.
[20662.02s -> 20670.86s]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[20670.86s -> 20672.70s]  I just wish he would chill, you know?
[20673.96s -> 20679.63s]  Like, like not rage quit halfway through the game.
[20679.63s -> 20685.13s]  Cause like I said, people's elo and shit used to bother me a lot. I don't get bothered by it anymore cause I realized it was cringe.
[20685.53s -> 20689.63s]  I don't care about their elo and shit. What I care about is like, I just want them to play the game, you know what I mean?
[20689.97s -> 20695.13s]  Like, I just want them to not rage, not like be absolute apes in the game and just play. That's all I ask for.
[20695.93s -> 20699.83s]  I don't care if you're a Diamond player or Plat player in the game and you're just like accidentally in the game. Like, it's not your fault.
[20700.03s -> 20701.33s]  I just want you to push buttons.
[20705.75s -> 20707.65s]  What am I doing wrong to have a 36% win rate?
[20711.32s -> 20714.72s]  Uh, I can't see the link cause just, you'd have to give me your name and your server.
[20714.72s -> 20721.83s]  How you guys doing by the way? Everybody having a good day? You guys enjoying the stream? Having a good time?
[20722.73s -> 20729.33s]  Watching me go bald in live like live time. You guys are like, oh look Geronimo's going bald live on stream. I'm like, yeah
[20730.93s -> 20733.69s]  It's rough hold on I'm gonna take my pants off
[20771.50s -> 20775.45s]  Dude what I
[20775.45s -> 20777.45s]  Fuck you guys
[20777.45s -> 20783.29s]  They fucking like I get double swap. Did you guys see that shit? Oh, yeah, the support could do it and then he banned Senna
[20784.69s -> 20790.05s]  I mean I didn't hover it so that's my bad. God damn it. I should have hovered I was just like
[20790.05s -> 20802.69s]  taking my pants off. And now he wants first pick. Dude what? Oh my god I hate I don't I don't know
[20802.69s -> 20813.91s]  I don't know what to say this is crazy. Today's Thursday right? Am I losing days? Today's Thursday
[20813.91s -> 20831.78s]  right guys? It is? Okay cool. Uh what do I play they have Xerath and Xin. They have Xayah. I mean
[20831.78s -> 20841.15s]  I mean, I guess I could just play Rakan, it's not a big deal.
[20841.15s -> 20842.21s]  Let's see what their bot lane is though.
[20842.21s -> 20843.77s]  I actually have to see what their bot lane is
[20843.77s -> 20848.92s]  to choose my runes.
[20848.92s -> 20849.80s]  Sona?
[20849.80s -> 20851.48s]  No.
[20851.48s -> 20852.76s]  Oh, they have an Ezreal?
[20853.68s -> 20855.28s]  The fuck is their team comp?
[20855.28s -> 20879.95s]  Um, okay.
[20879.95s -> 20882.47s]  When you do this build, what's the secondary supposed to be?
[20882.47s -> 20887.99s]  I think it's supposed to be this.
[20887.99s -> 20889.47s]  Or maybe like revitalize?
[20890.51s -> 20894.90s]  I just feel like unflinching's so good.
[20894.90s -> 20897.84s]  Oh, they have a support Xerath.
[20897.84s -> 20898.92s]  So support Xerath, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20898.92s -> 20903.92s]  Okay, so I want, uh, I definitely want Glacial here, and I want...
[20903.92s -> 20911.24s]  Maybe I take MR, actually, instead of armor, because they have two poke champs.
[20911.24s -> 20912.24s]  And I take this.
[20912.24s -> 20913.24s]  Yeah, yeah, this is good.
[20913.24s -> 20916.76s]  Okay.
[20916.76s -> 20917.76s]  That's not bad.
[20917.76s -> 20918.76s]  Okay.
[20918.76s -> 20919.76s]  One sec, I'll be right back.
[20919.76s -> 20920.76s]  I need to get some more water.
[20920.76s -> 20968.39s]  30 seconds until minions spawn.
[20968.39s -> 20976.40s]  Oh, shit, no, don't fly!
[20976.40s -> 20977.40s]  Oh, shit, no, don't fly!
[20977.40s -> 20978.40s]  Oh, shit, no, don't fly!
[20978.40s -> 20983.33s]  Oh, shit, no, don't fly!
[20983.33s -> 20984.33s]  Oh, shit, no, don't fly!
[20984.33s -> 20985.33s]  Oh, shit, no, don't fly!
[20985.33s -> 20986.33s]  Oh, shit, no, don't fly!
[20986.33s -> 20987.33s]  Oh, shit, no, don't fly!
[20987.33s -> 20988.33s]  Oh, shit, no, don't fly!
[20988.33s -> 20990.33s]  No, don't flag me
[20990.97s -> 20992.97s]  Fuck man, I had to pee
[20993.73s -> 20995.73s]  Fucking flag me for afk cuz I didn't take a week
[20996.41s -> 21002.16s]  Can you not start with ad carry then move over to support? I always fall asleep before the ad carry gameplay
[21003.18s -> 21005.88s]  Wait, what? I fell asleep before ad carry?
[21006.58s -> 21008.58s]  What do you mean? Oh
[21008.94s -> 21011.30s]  You mean like start with my main and then play
[21013.86s -> 21027.69s]  Yeah, I played ad carry at the start I should probably
[21028.57s -> 21037.13s]  play AD carry more over support uh later in the stream here i'll play an ad carry game after this
[21038.09s -> 21064.99s]  i feel bad oh it's gragas i thought it was gonna be xerath but it's gragas i don't want to fight
[21064.99s -> 21068.35s]  too hard level one even though that that guy i should have gone in there that's my bad
[21069.15s -> 21072.67s]  i wanna i want to try and get level two here even though i think we actually win level one
[21075.88s -> 21079.40s]  oh i got his bone plating yeah i should have fought level one that was my bad
[21079.40s -> 21084.84s]  Cause we went very hard level 1, I just griefed it.
[21084.84s -> 21088.32s]  All I have to do there is go in on the Ezreal or the Gragas level 1 and they can't play
[21088.32s -> 21089.32s]  the game.
[21089.32s -> 21090.32s]  Right?
[21090.32s -> 21110.44s]  It's not worth it, it's not worth.
[21110.44s -> 21115.87s]  There's no way that I can not get E'd by Gragas there by the way.
[21115.87s -> 21129.58s]  I don't know if I can flash W there.
[21129.58s -> 21131.38s]  Maybe we shouldn't be egoing buddy!
[21131.38s -> 21139.86s]  This guy just fucking egos in front of me, like what?
[21139.86s -> 21159.03s]  Okay, I might have missed everything there, but like, you know, it's okay.
[21159.03s -> 21177.90s]  It's a little counterproductive when I take a tower shot to land a Q.
[21177.90s -> 21197.86s]  It feels a little counterproductive, but hey, I'm gonna back here just in case the enemy
[21197.86s -> 21201.77s]  Xin tries to gank mid.
[21201.77s -> 21209.71s]  Dude, I'm so sad I can't get boots.
[21209.71s -> 21210.71s]  I'm gonna wait.
[21210.71s -> 21212.71s]  Yeah, I'm gonna be cringe. I'm gonna wait I
[21213.19s -> 21217.51s]  Would never wait here normally, but you know what? It's just it's so like it's such a big buy. I
[21219.07s -> 21221.07s]  Don't want to I'm
[21221.51s -> 21227.47s]  Now that now that I've waited and beat cringe now, I have to sit here and wait. Oh, it's so painful. Okay, I'm on my way
[21228.47s -> 21247.43s]  I'm sorry, I guess
[21247.43s -> 21254.08s]  Worth the wait. Nah, not at all. I got lucky but
[21254.92s -> 21269.73s]  You know, what's interesting? I never used the stupid dematerializer
[21269.73s -> 21274.61s]  I think I should have like I should use it on every cannon or some shit, but I just don't do it
[21275.17s -> 21278.13s]  Because I know the reason you're supposed to use it is because it helps you push
[21278.81s -> 21281.63s]  Because you can do you materialize the cannon right and just instant. Yeah
[21282.41s -> 21285.77s]  so you're supposed to use it because it's like a really fast way to push but it's also a I
[21302.96s -> 21306.96s]  Should not have W'd fuck. I won't not the Gragas. Anyway, I
[21307.52s -> 21310.08s]  Fucked up. I shouldn't have W the Gragas. I should play it slower
[21312.73s -> 21314.73s]  This guy's gonna die. Oh
[21317.65s -> 21319.65s]  He's gonna die. He put himself against the wall. GG
[21321.61s -> 21323.45s]  That was my fault though
[21323.45s -> 21327.96s]  100%
[21327.96s -> 21332.72s]  Cuz if I didn't W in they can't kill us right and Gragas probably dies to the auto attack
[21332.72s -> 21335.52s]  Anyway, my thought process was Gragas is snared
[21335.52s -> 21340.94s]  So if I W here, but even after like even if I don't get E'd I'm pretty confident I die
[21341.96s -> 21388.02s]  Damn it. I tried I was out of everything. I wonder if I could have played that better
[21388.62s -> 21391.50s]  Maybe like if I could have weaved an extra auto in or something
[21391.50s -> 21393.50s]  I don't know
[21394.68s -> 21412.26s]  It's hard to know
[21412.26s -> 21414.26s]  I'm gonna go mid here. I
[21415.30s -> 21422.38s]  Can't okay. Well, I could go mid, but I think I I think I want to sit bot for a bit and get some XP
[21422.38s -> 21430.93s]  I think it's smarter to do that at this point. I think we should push this
[21430.93s -> 21450.18s]  I don't want to W in because I know Zen's here. Yeah
[21451.70s -> 21471.23s]  That's why I didn't want to W because I know Zen's here. They were just making it so obvious right like that it was like
[21471.23s -> 21478.03s]  sometimes when people make shit too good to be true it is too good to be true
[21478.03s -> 21483.95s]  like oh shit we're just gonna they're just gonna fight us here cool oh yeah I
[21483.95s -> 21516.70s]  gotta help him push my bad I'm playing sloppy you just wanna see a cool trick
[21516.70s -> 21526.03s]  watch this she could push the wave and then just min max the back yeah how cool
[21526.03s -> 21532.84s]  was that she just pushes the wave and I just back next to the bush and she's
[21532.84s -> 21564.64s]  like oh i guess i'll take the free ride i really need level six badly like bro i really cannot get
[21564.64s -> 21575.85s]  level six right now this is painful okay kill these maybe i'm six off this nope guess not
[21577.21s -> 21613.87s]  i was gonna stay mid there by the way and help the homie i need to go mid this is so awkward
[21613.87s -> 21643.40s]  bro help me bro like you gotta walk to me like i can't like my eve is like here i'm way over here
[21644.60s -> 21652.89s]  right and my eve's like yo homie like dude i'm like we're trying to push the wave in for her
[21652.89s -> 21662.73s]  and she's just not accepting to wait and i can't w the wall i mean i guess i could w the wall
[21662.73s -> 21665.85s]  because i was trying to walk around right like i saw her in trouble when i was here
[21665.85s -> 21671.37s]  so i wanted her to walk towards here so i could e over the wall that was my thought process e over
[21671.37s -> 21675.77s]  the wall helped the guy but he like didn't understand that and i just got shit on and
[21675.77s -> 21688.81s]  it felt really bad both our solos are getting absolutely shit on this is very bad because i
[21688.81s -> 21697.36s]  don't know how to help our team at this stage like i'm just always behind on tempo now around
[21697.36s -> 21727.48s]  the map in the wrong spot at the wrong time this is so awkward i have old we could kill this guy
[21727.88s -> 21733.88s]  I guess not
[21735.88s -> 21756.85s]  You could maybe kill the Zen if I sneak in here push the way push the way of hurry
[21758.33s -> 21776.66s]  He's got a crash it. I mean this guy's just dead
[21777.58s -> 21783.90s]  My 80 carry is gonna get fucked for it though. So I hope it was worth
[21784.82s -> 21786.82s]  Like my 80 carries gonna get zones
[21787.34s -> 21797.24s]  it's really hard to tell if anything like that's worth sometimes because I
[21797.24s -> 21798.72s]  I
[21798.72s -> 21802.80s]  Use my old before a dragon fight. We're gonna lose bot tower. There's just so many factors, right?
[21802.80s -> 21806.68s]  It's so hard and now I don't have words. It's so rough. I
[21825.76s -> 21828.40s]  Got the ignite off, but dude, I can't believe that Gragas lived
[21829.08s -> 21835.76s]  No, oh I had stopwatch. I have stopwatch. Oh my god. I'm the worst player in existence
[21836.20s -> 21837.44s]  I
[21837.44s -> 21839.84s]  Actually have the ability to live there. Oh
[21840.84s -> 21845.07s]  No, I should sell
[21845.07s -> 21856.59s]  my Magi's in shame. I actually just want the item so. Dude I'm so bad. Dude Gragas is low
[21856.59s -> 21869.34s]  key a good pick versus Rakan though you can stop his engage so easily. It's actually
[21869.34s -> 21938.64s]  low key a good pick. Bro. Nice. Not bad. I kind of want to back off here. You know what
[21938.64s -> 21944.48s]  feels kind of bad you guys notice that I just I got my uh I don't know if you guys noticed
[21944.48s -> 21953.73s]  this but I got my fucking I got like four assists just now but it was after I sold my
[21953.73s -> 21966.28s]  medjazz how fucking bad does that feel like actually oh by the way uh I wanted to ask
[21966.28s -> 21973.76s]  you guys what ad carry do you guys think is the most sought out for people to learn right
[21973.76s -> 21981.53s]  now like what would you say is like people want to learn this ad carry over other ad carries
[21982.33s -> 21998.60s]  what are you guys thinking my man says teemo okay makes sense got it depends yeah i'm just
[21998.60s -> 22005.56s]  trying to wonder like what um people would want to watch or what people would want to learn
[22005.56s -> 22008.92s]  specifically because i know everybody plays different shit but i know there's also like
[22008.92s -> 22024.20s]  popular shit, you know? Okay, I'm just bad. He's bad too. Listen, we're bad. We're bad
[22024.20s -> 22076.43s]  guys. Ooh, not bad. Jin Lucian, Xayah, Felios. Damn, is it like just that different? Like
[22076.43s -> 22090.88s]  a lot of people like different stuff? Because I've always just thought like, oh no. I guess
[22090.88s -> 22097.27s]  I've always just thought that people like, um, a lot of people really like like meta
[22097.27s -> 22102.15s]  ad carries or like really play makey ad carries right like jinx is probably the best ad carry in
[22102.15s -> 22107.75s]  the meta but i don't see a lot of people ever ask or like request to watch jinx you know what i
[22107.75s -> 22111.99s]  mean like jinx is not like she's not like a fun ad carry that people want to learn how to play
[22111.99s -> 22116.47s]  even though she is like the best ad there's like the people who are like oh yeah no jinx is boring
[22116.47s -> 22119.99s]  like i want to play jhin and like shoot people i want to play like lucian and dash around like
[22119.99s -> 22123.35s]  it's like so that's what i'm wondering is like what the number one ad carry is for like people
[22123.35s -> 22144.00s]  just like enjoy watching not bad though okay i think we could play an ad carry game i'm down
[22147.04s -> 22152.16s]  i i owe you guys an ad carry game i owe you that much for watching me play support for two hours
[22152.80s -> 22158.77s]  actually i think it was like two and a half hours uh yeah we played four games of support so it's
[22158.77s -> 22172.96s]  like two hours yeah i owe you guys for for that ziya or vayne ziya is fun to watch i do like ziya
[22172.96s -> 22183.25s]  you love jinx and kate oh there you go you're playing support top so you like to watch how
[22183.25s -> 22185.25s]  80 carries play it ah
[22186.33s -> 22203.14s]  So that you can like better help the homies got it got it we need eight wins
[22203.14s -> 22207.52s]  I think from this point we are right now. I think it's eight wins to get to grandmaster. I
[22208.48s -> 22217.28s]  Think oops because we're what 370 something right like three set 360
[22217.80s -> 22222.40s]  No, we just won. We're not 360. We're like 370
[22222.40s -> 22235.93s]  we're 387 okay so it's not updated but what is this stop so we need what seven wins net wins to
[22235.93s -> 22242.65s]  get to GM I think we can hit GM I'm a little less confident right now about master or about
[22242.65s -> 22248.41s]  challenger but I think we can definitely hit GM like I think I'll get stuck in GM for a bit
[22248.41s -> 22259.32s]  it, unless, uh, unless the games get higher quality, I'll be stuck in GM for a little
[22259.32s -> 22269.60s]  bit because the thing about the thing about the games so far is like the higher quality
[22269.60s -> 22274.70s]  the games get, the easier it actually is to carry if like, uh, if you're a decent player
[22274.70s -> 22278.32s]  because the better, um, your teammates get, which means that like, if you're at that,
[22278.32s -> 22281.76s]  like say like a challenger player will have a better time, a challenger AD carry player
[22281.76s -> 22287.60s]  carrying in challenger if they get a lead than in diamond if they get a lead if if that like
[22288.32s -> 22292.88s]  i know that sounds weird to say but that's it's it's basically just because like when your teammates
[22292.88s -> 22297.68s]  are better they enable you better and ad carry and all those other roles when they're being enabled
[22297.68s -> 22309.54s]  it's a lot easier to play the game like if i were to first pick jinx in challenger mmr there's a good
[22309.54s -> 22314.58s]  chance my teammates would pick stuff that like lets me play jinx right not saying it would happen
[22314.58s -> 22317.04s]  But there's like a chance that my teammates would pick something that like
[22317.56s -> 22320.36s]  They would pick like tanks or frontliners or some shit, right?
[22320.50s -> 22326.58s]  Or like Lulu whereas like if you pickin if you're picking Jinx first pick and like let's say you guys are gold average
[22326.86s -> 22331.10s]  Like your support might just literally pick like first time Vel'koz or some shit and you're like, well, this sucks
[22331.70s -> 22345.95s]  Dude, I swear every time I hear the end of this song
[22346.63s -> 22348.95s]  Does anybody know who forest within is?
[22350.59s -> 22355.39s]  I swear the guy talking at the end of this song sounds exactly like forest within
[22356.39s -> 22369.83s]  No joke, listen to this, listen to this, that guy who was like saying he was DJ, like that
[22369.83s -> 22373.97s]  guy sounded exactly like, I don't know why my brain does that, homie sounded exactly like
[22373.97s -> 22374.97s]  Forced Within.
[22374.97s -> 22380.39s]  I swear to god, it's actually like perfectly, like if you told me that was him, I would
[22380.39s -> 22386.85s]  immediately believe you.
[22386.85s -> 22388.57s]  This guy wants to join the Discord.
[22388.57s -> 22394.55s]  Oh, I'm nervous about this shit.
[22394.55s -> 22403.80s]  It is my support though, so like maybe we could join the discord and like work together
[22403.80s -> 22414.97s]  a bit, but I'm also nervous about joining discord calls with people on stream.
[22414.97s -> 22422.76s]  Oh, I don't know.
[22422.76s -> 22426.28s]  I don't know if it's worth, where would you put Ezreal on the tier list?
[22426.28s -> 22428.16s]  I think Ezreal is A tier.
[22428.16s -> 22431.64s]  I think he could be S tier for solo queue, but he's hard.
[22431.64s -> 22432.64s]  He's really hard.
[22432.64s -> 22434.10s]  Ezreal is one of the hardest ADs.
[22434.10s -> 22437.20s]  So I would say he's like A tier right now.
[22437.20s -> 22442.56s]  If you're really good at Ez, he is very, very, very strong.
[22442.56s -> 22446.36s]  But he's also incredibly hard to play.
[22446.36s -> 22448.60s]  But he also is not weak in the meta.
[22448.60s -> 22456.80s]  So I'd give him like a strong A. Like above other A's.
[22456.80s -> 22460.88s]  Should focus on mage supports like Brand, Xerath, or engage like Blitz and Nautilus.
[22460.88s -> 22463.88s]  It depends on your ELO and it depends on what you're doing.
[22463.88s -> 22469.74s]  I think engage supports in lower elo are bad.
[22469.74s -> 22474.40s]  Oh, somebody dodged.
[22474.40s -> 22482.43s]  I think engage supports in lower elo are bad personally because I think that you can be
[22482.43s -> 22487.27s]  a really good engage player and it doesn't matter if your team just gets caught over
[22487.27s -> 22491.31s]  and over again or if you like make it engage and your team misplays, right?
[22491.31s -> 22496.99s]  So it's like, if you want to play engage supports, do it because they are better than other
[22496.99s -> 22502.75s]  like engage supports are better than mages but i think in solo queue mages are better to solo carry
[22503.47s -> 22506.83s]  so it just depends it depends on your elo and it depends on like what you're trying to accomplish
[22506.83s -> 22512.11s]  right because a lot of the time as a support player it's why i play senna right like i play
[22512.11s -> 22519.87s]  senna because i like being able to carry games as support that's why i like senna whereas like if
[22519.87s -> 22525.87s]  you're a um like if i like i can play almost every support right i can play nautilus i can
[22525.87s -> 22531.59s]  I can play these supports, but the problem is, I feel bad if I get, it feels really shitty
[22531.59s -> 22534.99s]  to get people ahead and then have them completely throw their leads over and over again and
[22534.99s -> 22536.47s]  then tilt and rage and shit.
[22536.47s -> 22538.31s]  So it feels like dog shit.
[22538.31s -> 22543.99s]  So it's nicer to just give myself the opportunity to carry it rather than rely 100% on other
[22543.99s -> 22546.94s]  people, you know?
[22546.94s -> 22552.62s]  But I would say the number one thing is play what you think is fun.
[22552.62s -> 22553.78s]  That's just the number one rule.
[22553.78s -> 22558.82s]  Like playing, if you want to win, you can play meta, but the problem is if you're shoving
[22558.82s -> 22562.46s]  your face into trying to learn a meta champ that you just don't enjoy the playstyle of,
[22562.46s -> 22566.14s]  you're never going to actually be good at the champion because you're like, it's like
[22566.14s -> 22567.76s]  you're working, right?
[22567.76s -> 22571.98s]  But the best way to learn the champions and learn how to play the game is to have fun.
[22571.98s -> 22576.54s]  Because if you're not having fun at some point, you're not gonna be able to learn how to play.
[22576.54s -> 22579.86s]  Because you're not going to be able to put in the hours or put in the games and be focused
[22579.86s -> 22580.86s]  during the game.
[22580.86s -> 22581.86s]  You're going to be frustrated.
[22581.86s -> 22583.64s]  And if you're frustrated, you're not going to be learning.
[22583.64s -> 22590.70s]  i would say just play something that's fun the fun aspect is gonna be way more important
[22596.16s -> 22611.10s]  where'd my music go the fuck i'm surprised can you guys even hear the music half the time
[22611.66s -> 22614.14s]  i have it on solo that i'm not even sure you guys can hear it
[22615.34s -> 22642.46s]  it's just like barely background noise is this guy holding swap hostage
[22644.38s -> 22668.48s]  join call and i'll swap dude he's holding swap hostage by the way if you guys do like the stream
[22668.48s -> 22674.64s]  don't forget to follow you can scroll down to see all my socials too like tiktok instagram all that
[22674.64s -> 22690.14s]  crap it's all below the stream there's like links and shit and uh you know a man's gotta eat you can
[22690.14s -> 22708.00s]  use your twitch prime too if you want you know you're feeling it i'm gonna do a kaisa game he
[22708.00s -> 22718.57s]  went lux but i kind of want to play kaisa what was the voice this is what happens when i get close to
[22718.57s -> 22726.45s]  the mic. I should put the mic in front of my face more the mics like over to the corner.
[22726.45s -> 22750.58s]  So the mic is like really badly directions.
[22750.58s -> 22761.21s]  This is a cut down game. Greg is always use AP. He doesn't go tank goes like AP.
[22761.21s -> 22783.32s]  Kind of like a last stands. That's fun. I should think ghost goes through and so good
[22783.32s -> 22794.66s]  this game. You tried Cait with shield bow? It's strong? Yeah, it's fun, huh? I love Cait
[22794.66s -> 22800.90s]  with shield bow, it's so fun. This would have been such a good ghost game. I'm frustrated.
[22800.90s -> 22818.82s]  Oh well. I wasn't paying attention. I always wonder if I should go... Part of me always
[22818.82s -> 22826.86s]  wants to go long sword 3 against Thresh and Xayah, but with Kai'Sa, I feel like you're
[22826.86s -> 22833.66s]  really specific timers with kaisa so you have to go like it's really important to go doran so that
[22833.66s -> 22840.22s]  you can get the q upgrade timer on the right you know like on the right timing i think getting
[22840.22s -> 22848.22s]  the q upgrade timer is just so big also this game i feel like i go bork this game seconds
[22848.22s -> 22853.90s]  bork or what's ends if gragas is not ultra fed i'll probably go bork because i don't want to
[22853.90s -> 22877.13s]  to get what's in just for Greggas. Okay, he started Q. Oh, Diana starting on wolves. Okay.
[22877.13s -> 22906.46s]  I need to get some coffee after this game. I'm getting drowsy. I should have done the
[22906.46s -> 22911.36s]  middle minion thing. I'm so bad. Like I should have legitimately just done the thing with
[22911.36s -> 22920.64s]  the minion. So when you know Thresh starts hook, you can still play up, right? I can
[22920.64s -> 22945.59s]  play up, I can play aggressive. I'm bad. I should have just killed the Thresh. This
[22945.59s -> 22950.54s]  This is really bad man, we can't help, we can't help.
[22950.54s -> 22956.09s]  Cause the wave, the way the wave's going, oh I'm so bad, I fucked up.
[22956.09s -> 22962.96s]  It should be fine, but I still, like, we're, it fucks us over early game.
[22962.96s -> 22965.48s]  Cause they fucked up very badly.
[22965.48s -> 22971.44s]  Like, I can't stress enough how badly they just fucked up, but it didn't matter.
[22971.44s -> 22972.44s]  Okay.
[22972.44s -> 22974.68s]  That's, that's happening apparently.
[22974.68s -> 22979.52s]  Don't worry guys, I'm the best Xayah player, er, Kai'Sa player on the server.
[22979.52s -> 22988.88s]  It's me.
[22988.88s -> 22991.38s]  I am just literally playing like dog shits.
[23006.50s -> 23007.50s]  Why pick Kai'Sa?
[23008.00s -> 23009.00s]  I just felt like playing her.
[23014.27s -> 23015.27s]  We gotta back.
[23015.27s -> 23016.77s]  We have to leave the wave in a bad spot.
[23017.77s -> 23019.77s]  Maybe she can push it, but like Wukong's here, so...
[23028.94s -> 23030.44s]  Yeah, we just... Okay, we got it.
[23030.44s -> 23031.44s]  Nice. Not bad.
[23032.44s -> 23033.94s]  So, we had to push the wave in there,
[23034.44s -> 23035.94s]  so that the wave will bounce back.
[23035.94s -> 23036.94s]  But we had to do it on a...
[23036.94s -> 23038.44s]  It was a really bad timer.
[23038.44s -> 23040.94s]  Let me just say, I fucked up the entire early game of this game.
[23040.94s -> 23042.44s]  Like, this game's... I'm so bad.
[23043.44s -> 23044.94s]  Essentially, what should have happened was,
[23044.94s -> 23049.50s]  was level one when they walked up when kaisen thresh walked up level one we should have killed
[23049.50s -> 23054.62s]  them like i should have just straight up hit the thresh with the uh locks because thresh walked into
[23054.62s -> 23059.42s]  our wave because wukong was level two ganking should have just killed him i griefed that and
[23059.42s -> 23063.98s]  because i went for the xayah instead i put myself in a spot where i took like 80 of my hp for free
[23064.70s -> 23069.98s]  right which put me behind and now the entire fight was like harder because i was low and then we had
[23069.98s -> 23072.74s]  We had to wait for the way. It was just it was really bad
[23074.30s -> 23075.46s]  Really
[23075.46s -> 23085.99s]  That minion actually just did that. I don't think we can kill this guy unless she can max range land a Q or something
[23085.99s -> 23095.96s]  But yeah, is there the best lady right now? No, I think Jinx is better. I
[23096.56s -> 23098.08s]  Think Zarya is good
[23098.08s -> 23101.42s]  Her late game, especially with like paired with an enchanter. Zarya is insane
[23102.12s -> 23104.80s]  But I think Jinx is better for solo queue
[23104.80s -> 23113.94s]  Uh oh, I actually have to flash.
[23113.94s -> 23119.64s]  That was a good play hook by that guy, I disrespected him.
[23119.64s -> 23125.68s]  I might have to leave because Wukong can just go here and dive me.
[23125.68s -> 23128.78s]  I actually just have to leave, this feels so bad.
[23128.78s -> 23132.40s]  You see how Wukong just used the plants?
[23132.40s -> 23134.18s]  If I stay, I can just die right?
[23134.18s -> 23136.54s]  So I'm just misplaying all over the place.
[23136.54s -> 23140.18s]  I'm taking too much damage, we're playing weak side right now right?
[23140.18s -> 23143.66s]  I mean by that is like we know our Diana's top and we know their Wukong's bot
[23143.90s -> 23147.28s]  So because of that I need to play a lot less tradey
[23147.60s -> 23150.94s]  Like I walked up and just let the Thresh flame me for free and I missed two waves now
[23150.94s -> 23153.78s]  I need to not do that because if I don't miss these waves
[23153.78s -> 23158.10s]  It doesn't matter if we're weak siding because I'm not behind so it's it's just really stupid
[23162.80s -> 23166.88s]  Now what I do want to do is I want to go check and see if the Wukong's like on our camps or something
[23166.88s -> 23176.94s]  Or if he's doing dragon or some shits. I should not have used the blast cone. Dude. I am so bad
[23178.62s -> 23180.96s]  I used the blast cone to just hit it.
[23180.96s -> 23182.10s]  It's playing support, man.
[23182.10s -> 23184.42s]  It makes your brain smaller.
[23185.54s -> 23201.12s]  Actually.
[23201.12s -> 23211.26s]  Like, I swear playing support makes my brain smaller.
[23211.26s -> 23233.00s]  Oh, they're in dragon.
[23233.00s -> 23234.10s]  The Xayah's trolling.
[23235.60s -> 23238.75s]  I think.
[23238.75s -> 23239.87s]  Pretty sure I just freeze this, no?
[23239.87s -> 23245.91s]  With the Lux?
[23245.91s -> 23246.75s]  Yeah, she's just trolling.
[23246.75s -> 23250.46s]  I don't know what the fuck that was.
[23250.46s -> 23252.36s]  I took a little bit of damage, but...
[23253.58s -> 23276.27s]  She has to overextend now.
[23276.27s -> 23277.11s]  Not bad.
[23277.11s -> 23279.39s]  Okay, so the Xayah wanted to back.
[23279.39s -> 23282.57s]  The reason that I froze that was because Xayah wants to back, but she can't back until we
[23282.57s -> 23283.57s]  push the wave in.
[23283.57s -> 23285.89s]  Or until they push the wave in, right?
[23285.89s -> 23291.21s]  So it gives me time to kind of catch up on my back timer with Xayah, because I'm, you
[23291.21s -> 23301.93s]  know, a little bit behind in farm.
[23301.93s -> 23304.61s]  Thresh is definitely going to go mid here.
[23304.61s -> 23308.81s]  He's either going to go mid or he's going to try and hook us from the bush.
[23308.81s -> 23311.61s]  I think I'm going to shoot my W through all the bushes here.
[23311.61s -> 23315.21s]  Okay, Thresh isn't in the bushes.
[23315.21s -> 23316.21s]  He's just mia.
[23316.21s -> 23322.55s]  where he is this is awkward because i can't really walk up i mean i guess i'm almost six
[23322.55s -> 23333.84s]  so i guess i could walk up yeah there he is okay we see him he is level five so it's
[23335.04s -> 23338.40s]  we could probably actually fight like if this guy lands a binding i might be able to just trade
[23345.56s -> 23357.89s]  i just i and i'm dead i suck honestly i i needed to my bad i'm playing bad that's on me
[23357.89s -> 23365.29s]  The Lux is playing so good. I needed to uh, W but then back up after the bind. I'm just,
[23365.29s -> 23373.29s]  I'm mechanically shitting on myself right now, like out of my mouth, just shit. Cause
[23373.29s -> 23376.25s]  I knew exactly what was going to happen when I used W in front of the fucking Thresh's
[23376.25s -> 23381.29s]  face. I was like, here we go. You know what I mean? Technically we're both six and he's
[23381.29s -> 23387.87s]  five, but it doesn't matter because if I get hooked, I don't have enough damage. So now
[23387.87s -> 23397.35s]  Now here, I'm gonna walk up and see if I can stop the Xayah's back maybe.
[23397.35s -> 23399.67s]  Or maybe she's backing in a weird spot.
[23399.67s -> 23402.89s]  Yeah, we stopped their backs.
[23402.89s -> 23403.89s]  Huge!
[23403.89s -> 23406.53s]  Okay, now they're in trouble.
[23406.53s -> 23413.85s]  So they really needed to back on that timer because they just wanna fight, right?
[23413.85s -> 23418.01s]  And because they just wanna fight, they wanna go back, right?
[23418.01s -> 23419.01s]  No way!
[23419.01s -> 23424.06s]  Dude, fuck off!
[23424.06s -> 23427.42s]  I cannot dodge a hook right now to save my fucking life.
[23427.42s -> 23429.22s]  Jesus Christ.
[23429.22s -> 23433.83s]  What is my movement, man?
[23433.83s -> 23442.71s]  Like tilting myself right now.
[23442.71s -> 23447.97s]  I wanna stay for this wave, but mid is Mia.
[23447.97s -> 23448.81s]  Yeah, I can't.
[23450.81s -> 23452.57s]  It feels so bad,
[23452.57s -> 23455.89s]  because I needed one more wave to get double pickaxe,
[23455.89s -> 23457.69s]  so I can get my upgrade.
[23457.69s -> 23460.33s]  Because like normally you go Noon Quiver, pickaxe, pickaxe.
[23460.33s -> 23462.17s]  And if you go Noon, pick, pick,
[23462.17s -> 23464.45s]  it gives you enough AD to get your Q upgrade, right?
[23464.45s -> 23468.43s]  And that's like the whole point you don't need kraken you just need your Q upgrade because your Q upgrades when you start bursting
[23469.33s -> 23474.11s]  But because I got hooked under the turrets even though we got a kill I had to back and I couldn't get my timer
[23474.59s -> 23488.54s]  I'm so trash. I need some coffee. That's what it is, man. I swear to God
[23489.40s -> 23491.40s]  Coffee is my savior. It'll save me
[23520.48s -> 23523.12s]  That wave actually just did that to me holy shits
[23524.40s -> 23526.64s]  We don't actually have to do anything here crazy
[23538.84s -> 23547.65s]  Nice well played
[23558.29s -> 23560.29s]  Nice nice nice
[23560.97s -> 23574.24s]  That was good to be too. All right. I got my Q upgrade now. We're chillin. Oh now we're hella chillin. Oh
[23575.62s -> 23577.38s]  Yeah, baby
[23577.38s -> 23583.51s]  You know what it is. It's like
[23584.39s -> 23594.48s]  I'm playing the fights too quick. I just got to slow down and like think I'm like too hyped up. I
[23606.19s -> 23609.07s]  Really don't want to miss this wave. There's a person right there. Oh
[23610.63s -> 23612.63s]  Shit let's go
[23612.63s -> 23613.63s]  Yeah, he's dead.
[23613.63s -> 23620.91s]  Okay, I'm gonna go farm bot while that guy gets that.
[23620.91s -> 23632.32s]  This Lux is really good.
[23632.32s -> 23636.80s]  I kinda wanna, oh, I can't get this plate, fuck.
[23636.80s -> 23637.80s]  What?
[23637.80s -> 23638.80s]  What?
[23638.80s -> 23639.80s]  That was BS.
[23639.80s -> 23649.18s]  Okay, you know what, I'll just take my entire HP bar really quick on the turret, it's not
[23649.18s -> 23651.34s]  a big deal, guys.
[23651.34s -> 23652.90s]  I'm just, I'm that good at the game.
[23652.90s -> 23656.58s]  Like, I don't mean to brag, but like, you know, professional gamer over here, like,
[23656.58s -> 23657.58s]  you know.
[23657.58s -> 23687.00s]  You're gonna want some lessons like I got you dude look how big my shield is wait
[23688.72s -> 23690.72s]  You son of a bitch I
[23691.80s -> 23708.69s]  Mean she's dead, but I got outplayed men
[23712.95s -> 23728.04s]  Motherfucker, all right, they forfeited nice
[23729.96s -> 23736.21s]  Well, I need to make some coffee I'm playing give me a sec
[23737.17s -> 23739.17s]  We're playing real bad. I need some coffee
[23739.17s -> 23758.43s]  nice though we hit 400 LP let's go so now we just need 150 more we need 550 I
[23758.43s -> 23776.03s]  think 550 is GM I didn't do anything that game by the way I did nothing I
[23776.03s -> 23780.67s]  could play another ad carry game that was fun I'm gonna grab some coffee I'll
[23780.67s -> 23787.79s]  be right back talks amongst yourselves boys I believe in you you can look at my
[23787.79s -> 23791.75s]  ad carry tier list that we've been trying to figure out how to do enjoy
[23791.75s -> 23899.50s]  I'll be right grab some coffee Oh fucking a all right I'm back let's go
[23899.50s -> 23921.77s]  the book sweet be back boys we back time is it five oh I probably play for like
[23921.77s -> 23928.29s]  another hour and then I gotta get off and make some dinner do some other shit
[23928.29s -> 23930.29s]  You know what I'm saying?
[23930.29s -> 23943.48s]  Where were we? Oh, yeah, we're making the tier list. Yeah, I think Varus is really good A.
[23944.68s -> 23946.68s]  I think Varus is a good A tier because um
[23947.84s -> 23949.30s]  In my opinion
[23949.30s -> 23953.02s]  Varus is never really like a bad pick almost like sometimes he's bad
[23953.02s -> 23957.00s]  But I think he's just you can play him on hit or you can play him with AoE
[23957.32s -> 23962.84s]  Right, so he's got two builds that you can do based on the game and the team comp. His ulti is pretty much always useful
[23962.84s -> 23967.68s]  Like just having a stun like a root on a champion is always gonna be useful, right?
[23967.88s -> 23973.00s]  Then you have he's got very long range like engage. You can safely kill people with his ult and his Q
[23973.52s -> 23977.36s]  You can build him poke where like before objectives you can make picks really easily
[23977.36s -> 23979.36s]  You can poke people out before the objective get him low
[23979.88s -> 23985.76s]  His lane phase is really good. If you're if you understand like how to play Varus his lane phase is exceptional. He also has
[23987.76s -> 23990.84s]  In the meta currently I feel like he's just like a good pick
[23990.84s -> 23995.32s]  I don't think he's as good as Draven and Jinx for solo queue, but I do think he's really good
[23996.08s -> 23998.68s]  In general you can you can climb with them really easily
[23999.68s -> 24002.10s]  And then I put Ashe here, too
[24002.90s -> 24005.32s]  Maybe Ashe. I don't know who I'd put in front
[24006.36s -> 24011.92s]  Ashe or Varus. I feel like maybe Ashe or maybe Varus. I think Ashe is really underrated though
[24011.92s -> 24027.08s]  I think Ashe is super super good right now. I think Ashe is super good
[24027.96s -> 24029.44s]  because
[24029.44s -> 24031.44s]  Sorry, I'm trying to think
[24032.40s -> 24036.08s]  She's basically the same idea as Varus. She's a little different, but she's the same idea.
[24038.48s -> 24042.80s]  She controls lane phase pretty well, right? Like her lane isn't too bad. She also has
[24044.80s -> 24048.80s]  like her R, always useful no matter what. So like you'll always have use with Ashe,
[24048.80s -> 24053.20s]  you'll always have use with Varus R, like they just stuns, snares, etc. in solo queue.
[24054.00s -> 24057.52s]  She's also really good at being annoying in teamfights, like you can take ghost on Ashe,
[24057.52s -> 24062.24s]  and you can just volley, sit outside their range, and if you just basically solo people
[24062.24s -> 24067.12s]  and she actually has decent scaling on her crit now so you can go a bunch of builds too like I
[24067.12s -> 24071.52s]  think you can go Bork Ashe, you can go Kraken Slayer Ashe into Bork, or you could go Kraken
[24071.52s -> 24077.12s]  Slayer into IE, or you can go Kraken Slayer into like whatever you can go Shieldbow Ashe if they
[24077.12s -> 24080.56s]  have tanks, you can go Galeforce Ashe, or you can just do a lot of different builds on Ashe and I
[24080.56s -> 24085.28s]  think she's really versatile. You could also just go the on-hit build if you really want. I think the
[24085.28s -> 24088.04s]  the rageblade build sucks personally I think that if I was gonna go on hit I
[24088.04s -> 24092.44s]  would just be like shield bow wits end into like bork or some shit if I was
[24092.44s -> 24101.13s]  actually gonna do that or shield bow bork or bork wits or whatever but yeah I
[24101.13s -> 24107.37s]  don't know Ezreal's probably a tier 2 I said Ezreal's really gated by like skill
[24107.37s -> 24112.23s]  so I don't want to put him in I think if you could play Ezreal perfectly he'd
[24112.23s -> 24117.11s]  be at the top of S like he would just be above Jinx just best champion in the
[24117.11s -> 24122.11s]  If you could if you could never miss a skill shot like a hundred percent accuracy played perfect like the champs insane, right?
[24122.55s -> 24127.83s]  It's absolutely crazy. How good that champ is if you can play him perfect, but you're like people are humans, etc
[24127.99s -> 24132.63s]  So I think he's like an a tier pick in solo queue because you can get countered like he's not blindable
[24132.63s -> 24134.63s]  You can get countered pretty easily by good players
[24135.15s -> 24139.19s]  People play like push comps people play dive comps like early game
[24139.19s -> 24142.69s]  I mean in lane and shit so like because Ezreal's lane is like not it's not bad
[24142.69s -> 24147.45s]  But it's very difficult to play Ezreal well in lane phase. You got to be good mechanically
[24147.45s -> 24152.05s]  And I don't think even like I've seen like challenger players who can't play Ezreal so
[24153.07s -> 24155.07s]  He's not easy
[24155.41s -> 24170.04s]  You know what I'm saying? What's up boys?
[24170.76s -> 24197.44s]  So I was gonna ban Kindred, but I couldn't find her
[24198.88s -> 24228.54s]  I hate Kindred. Yo, how we doing tonight? How's everybody's day? Okay, so this guy's picking Thresh again
[24228.54s -> 24285.68s]  Thresh into Rakan. Thresh is actually pretty good into Rakan. They have Xayah Thresh again. Let's play Jinx. I like Jinx here
[24287.12s -> 24292.04s]  Even though it is against Thresh, Jinx is a little scary, right? But I kind of like her in this situation
[24292.52s -> 24304.40s]  See what runs. Do I want free boots? Nah, I think I want I want to be able to get early boots this game
[24304.92s -> 24309.19s]  because their team comp is like
[24310.07s -> 24313.39s]  Oh yeah, their team comp is really really annoying. So I kind of want to get
[24313.39s -> 24323.03s]  early boots I'll probably go presence of mind although I think overkill isn't bad
[24323.03s -> 24334.60s]  actually I'll go overkill so yeah these runes look good actually let's do this
[24334.60s -> 24346.57s]  or this this yeah this is good okay I kind of like these this is good I'm
[24346.57s -> 24351.41s]  gonna use these okay I'm taking coins this game because they have Lissandra
[24351.41s -> 24354.69s]  and pantheon and thresh right so with lissandra pantheon and thresh
[24356.77s -> 24362.45s]  the game's gonna be like really fast of like okay if they stun me i'm just gonna get cc chained and
[24362.45s -> 24366.45s]  i'm just gonna die like after a bit right it's gonna be like a stun and there's done and there's
[24366.45s -> 24401.80s]  done and i'm just gonna die so i'm like nah fuck that shit let's see if we can get this w boys
[24409.67s -> 24418.87s]  let's see if i can not fuck up the first three levels to win got chat restricted oh yeah it's
[24418.87s -> 24427.86s]  for a while. It's Riot's secret code to make it so I can actually play the game and climb
[24427.86s -> 24454.93s]  without chatting. Okay, I should have warded this bush. I was drinking my coffee, I didn't
[24454.93s -> 24459.05s]  think about it. But yeah, if you guys are against the hook champ, uh, always ward this
[24459.05s -> 24467.63s]  bush. Right, like right here, you're gonna want to ward here early against most hook
[24467.63s -> 24473.87s]  champions because it gives you a very nice like they can't walk in here and
[24473.87s -> 24477.07s]  cheese you they can't walk in here and cheese you so you just don't get cheesed
[24477.07s -> 24513.56s]  by anything I mean that's just I don't even know what I just saw I'll be real I
[24513.56s -> 24517.72s]  don't know what the fuck just happened but okay trying to push this wave as
[24517.72s -> 24521.52s]  fast as I can I'm not sure I can actually get it pushed fast enough but
[24521.52s -> 24542.60s]  we're gonna try it was close no I'm gonna let it just push it's not a huge
[24542.60s -> 24552.38s]  deal it was very close though we can just break the freeze right like it's not a huge deal are
[24552.38s -> 24559.10s]  they supposed to win level one it depends i mean xayah is not that good level one like she xayah
[24559.10s -> 24563.42s]  is good because she has her feathers right but if you can't stack your feathers level one jinx has
[24563.42s -> 24569.42s]  more damage and they stacked up for my gap or for my rocket so i got like i full stacked my lethal
[24569.42s -> 24576.96s]  tempo and i just double aoe rocketed them over and over and over and over again right and so
[24577.60s -> 24580.68s]  When they finally all end they were just behind in HP
[24581.96s -> 24612.93s]  Also Thresh missed. He only had flay. Damn. That was so close, man
[24613.85s -> 24634.04s]  Like actually if Thresh had died there, or not Thresh, if Graves had died there, we just win the game
[24634.60s -> 24650.97s]  Yeah, this isn't good. Oh, I'm gonna get flayed. I'm dead
[24652.27s -> 24655.17s]  Maybe? Oh, maybe I'm not dead. I have to walk up like this
[24656.91s -> 24660.35s]  It was a really bad fight by the way, what am I watching? What the fuck?
[24661.39s -> 24668.15s]  That was just a bad fight, because we knew Graves was bot, and we knew that he was going
[24668.15s -> 24670.63s]  to heal in the jungle, right?
[24670.63s -> 24674.97s]  So like, my jungler already got outplayed by Graves once, top side.
[24674.97s -> 24677.57s]  You shouldn't ever take another fight like that, bot side.
[24677.57s -> 24679.39s]  You should just take the win, right?
[24679.39s -> 24685.19s]  Like I rotated, now granted the Rakan should have been there to help kill the Graves.
[24685.19s -> 24688.91s]  Like when I rotated, Rakan was still jacking off in lane, right?
[24688.91s -> 24691.45s]  Like when I was here, Rakan was like way down here.
[24691.45s -> 24695.05s]  So the support should have rotated first, right?
[24695.05s -> 24697.53s]  Like I rotated, but the support should have been the one rotating.
[24697.53s -> 24701.71s]  But again, he's just a lot of the time you have support players who don't understand timers
[24701.71s -> 24702.71s]  and how to help jungle.
[24702.71s -> 24704.59s]  Nobody plays for jungle.
[24704.59s -> 24707.27s]  Support players hate playing for jungle in low elo.
[24707.27s -> 24710.61s]  So it's just not a thing.
[24710.61s -> 24716.63s]  So I tried to go over and help him, but I misplaced my traps a little bit.
[24716.63s -> 24721.35s]  And then the graves had a flash but he got away.
[24721.35s -> 24725.75s]  And they tried to go in again when I was too low to actually help.
[24725.75s -> 24732.45s]  We just got lucky we didn't lose the game off that shit.
[24732.45s -> 24733.45s]  Kind of does suck though.
[24733.45s -> 24734.45s]  Xayah is really strong now.
[24734.45s -> 24750.01s]  Not bad.
[24750.01s -> 24753.25s]  I should have, oh I should have, I could have killed her.
[24753.25s -> 24758.28s]  I was supposed to say I could have killed the guy.
[24758.28s -> 24761.20s]  No joke, I totally could have killed him.
[24761.20s -> 24767.16s]  If I had warded the lantern as he tried to take it, I would have killed the Xayah.
[24767.16s -> 24782.24s]  she egoed the lantern there? She egoed the lantern so hard. If I had warded it, she dies
[24782.24s -> 24800.50s]  there. That's my bad. This game's really interesting because the enemy bot lane's actually misplaying
[24800.50s -> 24806.24s]  a lot. Like they're really, really, really misplaying these fights and trades and shit.
[24806.24s -> 24813.98s]  But we can't abuse it because the Graves has so much control of the game right now that
[24813.98s -> 24817.94s]  We have to basically play safe permanently at the moment, and I can't do anything to
[24817.94s -> 24819.20s]  help my team.
[24819.20s -> 24820.20s]  It feels really bad.
[24820.20s -> 24827.56s]  Remember my Kai'Sa game?
[24827.56s -> 24828.56s]  Yeah, that would've won.
[24828.56s -> 24838.60s]  See, look, Graves is bot again, man.
[24838.60s -> 24839.60s]  This is so rough.
[24839.60s -> 24853.80s]  Graves is mid.
[24853.80s -> 24865.78s]  I want to kill this as fast as I can.
[24865.78s -> 24867.78s]  We can fight these guys 2v2, actually.
[24867.78s -> 24882.20s]  Wait, why didn't he just go in?
[24882.20s -> 24885.00s]  I don't know why he didn't just W immediately.
[24885.00s -> 24886.00s]  Like the Rakan waited.
[24886.00s -> 24888.00s]  Oh, that tilts me.
[24888.00s -> 24894.72s]  Like when she was against the wall here, he should have immediately W'd her.
[24894.72s -> 24900.48s]  Because if he W's from vision there, right, and she's against the wall, it helps us so
[24900.48s -> 24901.48s]  much.
[24901.48s -> 24910.16s]  Because then I can overlay my flame chomps directly on top of the Xayah, right as the
[24910.16s -> 24915.44s]  fight's happening, rather than having to work around the fight because Thresh is in my face
[24915.44s -> 24920.78s]  type shit, you know?
[24920.78s -> 24923.30s]  So we're just, we're honestly just losing because we're not pulling the trigger fast
[24923.30s -> 24926.18s]  enough.
[24926.18s -> 24930.74s]  And we can't play aggressive when we can pull the trigger, right?
[24930.74s -> 24932.82s]  Like, we're losing because we can't pull the trigger fast enough.
[24932.82s -> 24938.58s]  And when we can pull the trigger, it's, uh, the wrong time.
[24938.58s -> 24939.58s]  We do this right now.
[24939.58s -> 24941.06s]  We get dragon.
[24941.06s -> 24942.06s]  The bot lane backed.
[24942.06s -> 24949.19s]  We get dragon here.
[24949.19s -> 24958.12s]  I want to go, uh, I actually want to go with the enemy bot lane didn't back.
[24958.12s -> 24959.12s]  Okay.
[24959.12s -> 24963.30s]  They're trolling.
[24963.30s -> 24964.46s]  They lost an objective for free here.
[24964.46s -> 24966.06s]  This is really good.
[24966.06s -> 24979.24s]  So the enemy bot lane, we fight this by the way, we can just straight up fight.
[24979.24s -> 24983.48s]  That right there is how you lantern, how you ward a lantern by the way.
[24983.48s -> 24987.28s]  Oh I did that guy so dirty.
[24987.28s -> 25001.13s]  Oh I'm dead, bye guys.
[25001.13s -> 25004.69s]  I didn't know Pantheon was Miya, that was my bad.
[25004.69s -> 25015.40s]  I was like going, I was too happy with warding the lantern, my bad.
[25015.40s -> 25018.96s]  I can't believe the enemy team greeted that hard though for gold.
[25018.96s -> 25024.45s]  Oh, that's actually nuts to me
[25031.54s -> 25034.50s]  No, yeah, the the Zayas egoing like crazy
[25036.02s -> 25041.50s]  The problem is I can't abuse it constantly because like obviously like I need teammates, right?
[25042.38s -> 25044.38s]  But I can kind of abuse it like
[25045.14s -> 25047.74s]  But it's much harder by yourself
[25048.46s -> 25055.09s]  Cuz as you can see like I'm not playing poorly, but we're getting like
[25056.05s -> 25057.89s]  We're getting shit on
[25057.89s -> 25059.89s]  Shit on is a bad word. We're getting like oh
[25059.89s -> 25087.65s]  Oh, come on, man. They misplayed that so badly, but Rakan just ate the fucking
[25088.89s -> 25095.01s]  Whatever. I'm not gonna blame Rakan. It's fine. I'm still sad about that though. They misplayed that so incredibly badly
[25096.25s -> 25098.25s]  like so badly
[25098.37s -> 25103.69s]  It was just that like Rakan all-in'd the Thresh with his ultimate, but all he had to do there was
[25104.41s -> 25107.95s]  Use his E to come back to me and then play front to back afterward
[25107.95s -> 25110.55s]  but he's he's out there autoing the Thresh
[25111.47s -> 25115.95s]  But you don't need to auto him. You just need to engage and then I can maybe play on after right?
[25120.29s -> 25122.83s]  I probably could have double killed them there too. I kind of messed up
[25125.56s -> 25127.56s]  My team wants out
[25127.96s -> 25130.80s]  It's not it's it's silly because the game's not even over
[25134.73s -> 25137.41s]  Like we actually can win this game so incredibly easily
[25138.41s -> 25143.17s]  So easily if we just play it correctly because their bot lane is really fucking bad
[25143.17s -> 25147.89s]  I didn't want to be mean, but I'll just be mean. Their bot lane is really fucking bad.
[25155.32s -> 25157.18s]  Well, I'm dead.
[25157.18s -> 25159.18s]  They're still bad.
[25159.92s -> 25162.90s]  I'm just egoing. That was my ego.
[25165.08s -> 25167.08s]  I still stand by it. I still think they're bad.
[25167.64s -> 25173.22s]  This guy's just playing 1v3 mid. The Thresh has not been mid one time. So it must be the top laner.
[25173.80s -> 25181.47s]  I'm- I am so frustrated right now with this game.
[25181.47s -> 25189.70s]  Because I feel like we should have won so many all-ins that we didn't win, barely, like
[25189.70s -> 25191.30s]  one, like barely, right?
[25191.30s -> 25192.78s]  Like barely didn't win some all-ins.
[25192.78s -> 25197.14s]  I feel like we should have won all of them.
[25197.14s -> 25199.54s]  Like they, they didn't land like a good all-in once.
[25199.54s -> 25202.98s]  Thresh didn't land a single hook once.
[25202.98s -> 25213.40s]  And this is my Rakan, like he just tried to, he just used his R to try and engage.
[25213.40s -> 25215.72s]  I think Nocturne is done mentally.
[25219.33s -> 25221.33s]  Okay, so in games like this
[25223.27s -> 25247.89s]  Like this thresh is so bad
[25248.13s -> 25250.13s]  Oh, let's go, baby
[25250.85s -> 25255.68s]  Huge
[25255.68s -> 25257.68s]  That was so huge. Let's fucking go
[25275.38s -> 25281.06s]  Like I i'm gonna hit no at 15 because dude, I really don't want to lose to this thresh and this xayah
[25282.74s -> 25286.50s]  Like this thresh is doing the most the most ego shit i've ever seen
[25288.02s -> 25292.74s]  And he's just getting away with shit like right there thresh walks up whiffs every spell
[25293.30s -> 25300.00s]  And expects to get away with that shit. Nah, no, no, we win these we win these trust give me let me cook
[25300.00s -> 25301.76s]  Let me cook. I
[25301.76s -> 25303.76s]  See my team to let me cook a bit, you know
[25304.60s -> 25308.98s]  Like we had a bad early game had to play weak side. Let me cook. Let me cook
[25310.50s -> 25343.64s]  We are chillin
[25343.64s -> 25384.70s]  If I landed that that would have been sick. The rest is top two we can kill this guy. Come on guys. Don't forfeit
[25385.34s -> 25387.66s]  Guys, the game is winnable. Oh my god
[25387.66s -> 25403.23s]  dude the game is how is the recon gonna forfeit dude that game is so winnable it hurts oh like
[25403.23s -> 25416.80s]  dude really that actually is so infuriating that's so infuriating man that game was so
[25416.80s -> 25424.27s]  incredibly winnable like look at this i did more damage than every single player on the enemy team
[25424.27s -> 25433.39s]  team. If my team just relaxed, we win the game a thousand times over that game. Like
[25433.39s -> 25440.81s]  the game is over. We have a Rakan, a Rumble and a Wukong for me to sit and sit behind.
[25440.81s -> 25445.21s]  And we saw how bad their bot lane was, right? I have cleanse for the only way they can kill
[25445.21s -> 25451.61s]  me ever, man. I wish to God I'm gonna report them all. Like these fuckers, I guarantee
[25451.61s -> 25459.26s]  i get a notification there's no way these people are not toxic there's no way you int this like
[25459.26s -> 25467.26s]  you just want out of the game after a fucking your team is just doing well nah man the score is 10
[25467.26s -> 25485.38s]  to 14 10 to 14 you have a fed ad carry look at this dude we forfeited we were down 2.5k
[25485.38s -> 25495.56s]  we had a better scaling comp than them like we outscale them we have two
[25495.56s -> 25506.18s]  dragons we outscale them and we're down 2.5 K and my team rage hits forfeit oh
[25506.18s -> 25525.06s]  my god that's so gross that is so disgusting so disgusting why am I in a
[25525.06s -> 25533.30s]  game with this player i'm 412 lp masters
[25533.30s -> 25537.06s]  i was in a game just now with a 7 lp masters
[25537.06s -> 25545.34s]  jungler and he's not on a smurf this is not a smurf account
[25545.34s -> 25551.37s]  because last season this guy was d4 so he's not on a smurf
[25551.37s -> 25560.92s]  why is this player in my game why is this player in a 400 lp master game
[25560.92s -> 25564.20s]  Why or rather why am I in a diamond one game?
[25569.69s -> 25572.65s]  You can go to his previous games. He doesn't even have good mmr
[25573.37s -> 25575.77s]  Like if you look at these games, they're all like what 100?
[25576.31s -> 25578.25s]  200 lp right
[25578.25s -> 25580.97s]  Why am I in this game? Why did you put me in a game with this player?
[25583.13s -> 25587.93s]  Like this guy, I don't even care if he sucks. I i'm more frustrated the fact that these players
[25588.49s -> 25591.53s]  Mental boom at the first sign of any negativity. Look at this
[25592.89s -> 25596.09s]  They just give up first sign of anything negative they go next
[25597.13s -> 25603.53s]  Like I actually could have 1v9'd this game too, but I'm not allowed to try and 1v9 because
[25603.53s -> 25607.97s]  my team wants out of the game at 4 minutes.
[25607.97s -> 25610.75s]  That sucks man.
[25610.75s -> 25613.21s]  The new system is trash.
[25613.21s -> 25620.25s]  I'm sorry but the 4-15 system is good sometimes, they should have a requirement that you have
[25620.25s -> 25624.17s]  to be losing by x amount of gold for it to kick in.
[25624.17s -> 25626.13s]  That should be it.
[25626.13s -> 25635.34s]  have a requirement you have to be losing by 5k plus for it to work at 15 like there needs to be
[25635.34s -> 25642.54s]  something where there's a requirement because people are so stupid right like that game was
[25642.54s -> 25650.46s]  100 hours we had two dragons we're down 2000 gold at 16 minutes and wukong's three and one we were
[25650.46s -> 25651.82s]  We were down four kills.
[25651.82s -> 25657.04s]  Wukong's three and one.
[25657.04s -> 25660.54s]  I'm literally insanely strong.
[25661.50s -> 25663.48s]  Even though we got weak-sided, I'm still winning.
[25663.48s -> 25665.42s]  We just 2v2'd them bot-side of the map, right?
[25665.42s -> 25666.78s]  Like, we just won a 2v2.
[25668.54s -> 25671.30s]  Rumble's just like, like, ha.
[25671.30s -> 25672.26s]  Sorry, I'm just mad.
[25672.26s -> 25673.10s]  I'm mad.
[25673.98s -> 25675.38s]  Like, they need to require,
[25675.38s -> 25677.62s]  they need to require something other than four people.
[25677.62s -> 25680.82s]  Like, require four people and a gold lead or something.
[25680.82s -> 25684.98s]  Like, that's so cancer.
[25684.98s -> 25689.60s]  That's so fucking frustrating, man.
[25689.60s -> 25692.16s]  Like, I can't believe how bad people's mentals are.
[25693.24s -> 25695.12s]  Like, okay, I get it.
[25695.12s -> 25697.90s]  The Rumble and the Nocturne,
[25697.90s -> 25700.16s]  I understand wanting to forfeit, okay?
[25700.16s -> 25701.88s]  Okay, they're having a bad game, they want out,
[25701.88s -> 25703.48s]  they're raging, they need to get their frustration,
[25703.48s -> 25704.44s]  I get it.
[25704.44s -> 25711.72s]  But why are we forfeiting when Wukong is three and one?
[25713.06s -> 25715.58s]  I have seven of our KP, I'm the AD carry,
[25715.58s -> 25717.74s]  I'm very, I just got my Mythic.
[25717.74s -> 25718.96s]  We have two dragons.
[25719.78s -> 25722.34s]  And Rakan's forfeiting too. I don't know, man.
[25726.50s -> 25735.86s]  That's just frustrating. I'll be real. I carry this game every day of the week.
[25737.62s -> 25768.41s]  Every day of the week, I carry those. Apparently Riot is doing something about smurfing though,
[25769.37s -> 25775.69s]  and I can't wait until they do. This is actually a really good thing that I wanted to talk about
[25775.69s -> 25780.25s]  earlier in the stream but I forgot. Apparently Riot is like doing something to make smurfing
[25780.25s -> 25785.85s]  harder because like apparently smurfing is outrageous right now and I kind of think that
[25785.85s -> 25792.41s]  they need to stop this too. So there's a there's a thing you can do in solo queue right now where
[25793.61s -> 25800.97s]  you can make a new account and you can duo with somebody on different accounts on a new account
[25800.97s -> 25804.55s]  and your MMR doesn't actually get like
[25805.61s -> 25806.65s]  lowered
[25806.65s -> 25810.73s]  So if you win a game
[25810.99s -> 25812.99s]  Let's say you win a game
[25814.01s -> 25821.13s]  Um, I think this is just him leveling the account, but let's say let's say you win a game and in that game you
[25823.36s -> 25828.12s]  Do all with somebody in a lower MMR, right now when you do in a lower MMR
[25828.12s -> 25829.38s]  I don't know if this guy did this or not
[25829.38s -> 25833.30s]  But when you deal with somebody in a lower MMR your MMR is based on
[25833.58s -> 25838.34s]  Now the game thinks that you're in that MMR and you can do it in placements
[25838.78s -> 25845.38s]  So in your very first games for some reason, there's no MMR lock on placements so you can in your placements
[25846.58s -> 25848.58s]  do it with somebody who's like
[25849.02s -> 25856.06s]  Bronze right and you can play with them and then the game thinks you're still winning. So it keeps amplifying your MMR
[25856.06s -> 25862.18s]  I'm describing this really poorly, but essentially you can duo in lower elos, and the game doesn't
[25862.18s -> 25867.10s]  know your MMR belongs in that elo, because you're winning in that elo.
[25867.10s -> 25870.38s]  The game can't figure that out for some reason, the algorithm.
[25870.38s -> 25877.42s]  So when they stopped duo queuing, it still inflated their MMR to where it would be if
[25877.42s -> 25879.30s]  they had solo queued.
[25879.30s -> 25881.90s]  Does that make sense in what I'm saying?
[25881.90s -> 25886.22s]  So it basically says that they went like 10-0 in their placements, right?
[25886.22s -> 25891.56s]  So now they're in like master tier MMR from a brand new account.
[25891.56s -> 25899.43s]  So now those people are in like D1 masters MMR, but they played, they won in gold.
[25899.43s -> 25909.81s]  I also don't think you smurfing should be so easily accessible.
[25909.81s -> 25914.61s]  Like this guy's not a bad player per se, but I don't think he's a master tier player, right?
[25914.61s -> 25917.09s]  Like this guy's a rumble player on a new account.
[25917.09s -> 25942.83s]  I from that game alone the fact he gave up tells me he's not a good player dude. I'm I'm a heavy advocator for like
[25943.63s -> 25947.55s]  Riot you have to attach like a verification to your accounts
[25949.23s -> 25950.99s]  I know riot would never do that
[25950.99s -> 25954.43s]  But i'm like a heavy advocator for like having to attach verification to play ranked
[25957.47s -> 25961.62s]  I think it'd be great. Honestly
[25961.78s -> 25975.01s]  I think it would help so much
[25975.01s -> 25977.01s]  If you get your verified account banned, are you done for it? Yeah
[25977.01s -> 25982.59s]  You have to get like a VPN to play other than like you would have to that's my point though like
[25983.33s -> 25985.65s]  If you get your verified account banned
[25986.77s -> 26009.48s]  Right like okay that counts done. Like I said, I don't think riot would ever do it because it's too it's too
[26010.82s -> 26015.26s]  Extreme and I don't think riot has the balls to ever do that shit VPNs only $5
[26015.58s -> 26018.70s]  Yeah, but dude, are you gonna tell me that you're gonna you're gonna buy it
[26018.70s -> 26024.52s]  People who get banned on accounts typically get banned consistently. That's why they're making smurfs
[26025.78s -> 26032.82s]  Right, so you're telling me somebody's gonna be willing to pay $5 for a new phone number verification or whatever
[26033.74s -> 26048.06s]  Every time they have to make a new account. They're not not you me
[26048.90s -> 26050.90s]  Lulu, yeah. Yeah, okay
[26051.30s -> 26053.30s]  Don't I have smurfs? Yeah, I do
[26053.94s -> 26058.62s]  And I stand by all my smurfs should be attached to the same like account
[26058.90s -> 26064.58s]  Like, if you make a smurf, okay, this is what I think should happen.
[26064.58s -> 26067.52s]  You should be able to put all of your smurfs on one account.
[26067.52s -> 26073.98s]  So you can make smurfs, and you can add that smurf verification to an account.
[26073.98s -> 26074.98s]  But it's kind of like battle.net.
[26074.98s -> 26075.98s]  Does that make sense?
[26075.98s -> 26080.26s]  You know how like battle.net has all your accounts in the battle.net thing, but you can
[26080.26s -> 26082.18s]  sign into battle.net?
[26082.18s -> 26087.42s]  I think that the way to make it viable would be like, you could put all, if you didn't
[26087.42s -> 26091.90s]  have a second phone number or didn't want one you could put smurfs up to like a limit so you could
[26091.90s -> 26095.90s]  have like three smurfs or like two smurfs in your main account right so you could have like three
[26095.90s -> 26102.38s]  total accounts and you you would have to like you could add those to the same like omega account
[26102.38s -> 26106.54s]  right and that omega account could be your verified account now if any of your accounts
[26106.54s -> 26116.00s]  get punished on your omega account all of your accounts get punished so if any of your accounts
[26116.00s -> 26132.94s]  get punished all of them get punished like i feel like that'd be a good play maybe i'm wrong but i
[26132.94s -> 26136.30s]  I feel like it would work. Yo, what's up brush? I called you brush. What's up?
[26141.15s -> 26143.15s]  What do I want to play?
[26143.31s -> 26145.11s]  No, I
[26145.11s -> 26154.00s]  Don't know what I want to do here. It's up range. Okay. I wish I didn't have cleanse cleanse is so worthless this game
[26154.00s -> 26156.00s]  like actually
[26156.40s -> 26158.40s]  When's those nothing this game at all
[26159.00s -> 26163.92s]  I'm just down to some like maybe if the brand like tries to flash stun me or some shit
[26164.20s -> 26179.40s]  But I'm just like down a summoner. All right, boys
[26179.40s -> 26183.08s]  Anyways, we got Nightblue3 on our team.
[26183.08s -> 26192.89s]  This is a throwback.
[26192.89s -> 26248.39s]  Damn.
[26248.39s -> 26256.20s]  Oh, we got him.
[26256.20s -> 26260.84s]  I'm not gonna lie, I kinda looked like I was scripting.
[26260.84s -> 26266.44s]  That movement, like if I was watching the game, I'd be like, what the fuck was that?
[26266.44s -> 26269.24s]  My movement was real sus.
[26269.24s -> 26305.97s]  On that all-in right there, that was some sus movement.
[26305.97s -> 26306.97s]  We can gank these guys.
[26306.97s -> 26319.44s]  They have no, oh, there's going to be a ward in here.
[26319.44s -> 26322.08s]  These people have no flashes.
[26322.08s -> 26323.16s]  Enemy bot lane has no flash.
[26323.16s -> 26326.60s]  This should be a free kill, honestly.
[26326.60s -> 26327.76s]  We just let these guys push in.
[26327.76s -> 26335.28s]  They can't walk up and we just play for that.
[26335.28s -> 26339.12s]  Even if they try and 3v3, we should just win the 3v3 because we're stronger.
[26339.12s -> 26347.95s]  Oh, this guy's just dead.
[26347.95s -> 26363.28s]  Yeah, I need level three.
[26363.28s -> 26365.36s]  I kind of fucked my entire wave here.
[26365.36s -> 26393.00s]  Yo, can we push? Is there any way we can just push this? Ooh, nice. Nice, well played. Nice
[26393.00s -> 26407.66s]  job. My Lulu's fucking fed as shit. Oh, I should have gone free boots this game. I didn't
[26407.66s -> 26414.58s]  think about it. Cause, uh, I don't need Sorc this game. You know how like the last game
[26414.58s -> 26419.86s]  I told you I was going boots. I went boots for the, uh, you know, the fast boot two rush
[26419.86s -> 26430.26s]  for thresh i don't need that this game because we just went through like faster mythic so
[26430.26s -> 26443.26s]  i should have gone free boots for like more efficiency can't understand i could just kill
[26443.26s -> 26471.73s]  a man you can't understand i could just kill a man i want to push this wave so we don't
[26471.73s -> 26500.39s]  get like, shit on.
[26500.39s -> 26503.07s]  I'm gonna just kill a man.
[26503.07s -> 26505.63s]  You can't understand.
[26505.63s -> 26507.25s]  Just kill a man.
[26511.31s -> 26515.27s]  Kill a man, there is something you can't understand.
[26516.39s -> 26544.51s]  Kill a man.
[26544.51s -> 26546.23s]  Hmm, I could go back here, but
[26547.31s -> 26558.84s]  I don't see any reason to go back yet.
[26558.84s -> 26564.46s]  I think I'm dead.
[26564.46s -> 26565.82s]  Ooh.
[26565.82s -> 26566.78s]  I misplayed that.
[26566.78s -> 26568.06s]  That was actually really good by Lula.
[26568.06s -> 26568.90s]  Cooldowns?
[26568.90s -> 26570.06s]  Nah, you're fine, man.
[26570.06s -> 26574.46s]  Wish I could I wish I could tell him that he played it fine. I messed up. Not him. I messed up
[26576.48s -> 26579.20s]  Ah, I feel bad. I want to like say no, you're fine
[26583.85s -> 26585.77s]  Because that was my bad
[26585.77s -> 26586.57s]  I should have okay
[26586.57s -> 26591.05s]  So when I flashed and I was running away from the twitch right the second that twitch flashed on me
[26591.05s -> 26593.05s]  I should have instantly started autoing him
[26593.53s -> 26598.57s]  Like I and it was one extra auto like one single extra auto and it would have been fine
[26602.08s -> 26606.22s]  Why can't I tell her?
[26606.22s -> 26608.22s]  You know, I just choose not to type anymore
[26608.22s -> 26644.79s]  It's my choice, you know, yeah, my choice, okay, it's actually doing that, huh?
[26644.79s -> 26665.44s]  We win to be too really fucking hard, especially with tier two boots, but I need a dude, I'm
[26665.44s -> 26666.92s]  doing some scripty shit.
[26666.92s -> 26673.92s]  I don't be real.
[26673.92s -> 26676.36s]  Dude, Lulu wasn't six.
[26676.36s -> 26677.82s]  I thought she was six.
[26677.82s -> 26682.06s]  I'm so bad.
[26682.06s -> 26684.18s]  I wish I could tell her my bad again.
[26684.18s -> 26686.70s]  I'm actually trolling.
[26686.70s -> 26689.84s]  I ran out of mana because I'm bad and then I
[26691.50s -> 26698.20s]  And then I thought she was six so I walked up to like take tank the turret for a second, right?
[26698.32s -> 26702.12s]  Cuz I was like, oh shit. Maybe I'll get like maybe we can kill this guy. Maybe Lulu has a spell or something
[26702.12s -> 26704.52s]  I just oh I played bad my bad
[26710.62s -> 26712.18s]  W that make sure
[26712.18s -> 26722.33s]  Echoes not there. I feel I actually just feel so bad because the Lulu is actually playing really there's like the best support
[26722.33s -> 26723.49s]  I've had all day
[26723.49s -> 26725.49s]  Like this guy's actually impressing me, right?
[26725.89s -> 26727.89s]  Like this guy's playing really well
[26727.93s -> 26761.90s]  And I'm just griefing Lulu gave her life for me
[26765.62s -> 26772.36s]  Lulu gave her life for me boys. Can we get a salute for Lulu in chat boys?
[26773.44s -> 26778.22s]  Do we get a salute? Can we get some love for Lulu?
[26779.90s -> 26806.87s]  She gave her life for the homie honestly, that was a really cool 2v2 by the way
[26808.39s -> 26812.63s]  Oh Nightblue smurfing it what the fuck yo kill that bitch, too
[26829.41s -> 26839.99s]  nice
[26839.99s -> 26841.99s]  No, oh
[26843.07s -> 26845.07s]  If I lost that cannon I would have lost my life
[26846.07s -> 26876.53s]  in game
[26876.53s -> 26881.85s]  I'm gonna go BT second item. We have Lulu. So wait, what the fuck is this pathing?
[26883.25s -> 26886.33s]  I clicked to go bot and it paths me in the weirdest spot ever. We have Lulu
[26886.41s -> 26891.33s]  So I could actually go IE second, but I think if I go BT, I'll be actually unkillable
[26892.69s -> 26894.89s]  Like it'll be the greatest thing ever.
[26894.89s -> 26901.78s]  I actually still might go ie as I'm thinking about it out loud by saying we have Lulu and not be stupid
[26901.78s -> 26908.42s]  But hey, I still might you know, I still might go ie but I don't know yet. We'll see cuz I took a lacquer D
[26908.42s -> 26910.32s]  so it's like
[26910.32s -> 26925.13s]  Wow
[26925.13s -> 26950.96s]  No, I'm gonna die. Yeah. I mean, I don't know why I flashed away
[26952.94s -> 26955.90s]  I'm playing bad. It's my fault. I
[26957.22s -> 26961.62s]  Think the game's over. So I'm just I'm playing bad. I'm like limit testing a little bit too much
[26961.76s -> 26993.06s]  I'm gonna get you today.
[26993.06s -> 27025.89s]  Nightblue, help!
[27025.89s -> 27028.44s]  Help!
[27028.44s -> 27029.50s]  Help!
[27029.50s -> 27058.45s]  Surprise they haven't forfeited though, what the fuck?
[27058.45s -> 27060.89s]  Dude, how does this game...
[27060.89s -> 27064.41s]  Oh, I'm even more mad, you guys have no idea.
[27064.41s -> 27067.27s]  So, I don't...
[27067.27s -> 27069.01s]  It's 24 to 8.
[27069.01s -> 27071.37s]  The enemy team doesn't forfeit.
[27071.37s -> 27073.93s]  My team forfeits when the score is 10 to 14
[27075.69s -> 27077.77s]  And we're only down a thousand golds
[27095.63s -> 27097.31s]  Sorry, I was
[27097.31s -> 27099.31s]  That was my bad. I was tilted by uh
[27101.82s -> 27105.58s]  You know, I was thinking about about how uh, they weren't forfeiting and I was getting mad
[27107.26s -> 27109.66s]  It is a little interesting because like I said, they still can't win
[27110.38s -> 27115.18s]  So I don't know who the fuck's heading. No, but it's probably echo. Well, no echo is definitely heading. No, but like who else?
[27117.10s -> 27121.39s]  Maybe brand
[27121.39s -> 27128.72s]  Maybe Riven. Maybe Riven's like, yeah. They did just get a thousand gold.
[27132.40s -> 27139.18s]  All right, I should probably stop trolling. I'd feel pretty silly if we lost because I'm bad.
[27139.82s -> 27143.66s]  After we like dumpster them and lane that hard, I'd feel pretty silly if we lost because I keep
[27143.66s -> 27167.42s]  getting caught. All right, I should be unkillable now. Like, I'm not even farming. I'm actually
[27167.42s -> 27172.22s]  griefing. I should probably go make dinner after this game. I want to keep playing because I'm
[27172.22s -> 27176.94s]  playing well today, but like, dude, my brain is starting to go like, like I probably need to go
[27176.94s -> 27195.47s]  make some food i'm getting the full adhd brain experience going so let's see if i can muster all
[27195.47s -> 27205.05s]  my focus let's see if i can muster up all my focus really quick just for push out and finish
[27205.05s -> 27213.71s]  this game we'll go terminator mode for the the end of this game right now we'll muster up all
[27213.71s -> 27278.01s]  of the uh all of the focus demon mode engaged boys god that sounded really cringe i'm actually
[27278.01s -> 27284.72s]  really impressed though nightblue played this game really really well like i'll be honest my last
[27284.72s -> 27291.52s]  like thought of night blue was him being bad at league. He played this game really well.
[27294.99s -> 27305.92s]  My man's gotten so much better. Okay, nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody
[27305.92s -> 27309.20s]  saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody
[27309.20s -> 27313.60s]  saw that. Nobody saw that. Not one of you saw me flash after the echo. Well, did not one of you.
[27321.68s -> 27329.28s]  Wasted flash. No, that was assertive flash. An assertive dominant flash. Not wasted at all.
[27329.92s -> 27338.80s]  They might actually go for baron here. We should look for this
[27340.64s -> 27351.08s]  Like they could try oh he's here pretty sure the ribbons here too, though
[27352.80s -> 27359.06s]  Yep, I did not mean to do that. I didn't mean to hit the thing. I accidentally hit the blast plants
[27360.44s -> 27363.48s]  That was that was an accident. It was a it was a literal pure accident
[27366.33s -> 27368.21s]  like I I
[27368.21s -> 27373.45s]  Did not mean to hit it. I was like, I know ribbons here. I'm gonna wait for Yasuo before I go over
[27373.77s -> 27378.95s]  Or before I do this right and I'm gonna bait him and I just completely whiffed every like I'm bad
[27379.19s -> 27384.51s]  We'll leave it at I'm bad. That's a good way to put I'm bad. I'm hungry. I'm old. I'm bald. I'm bad
[27384.75s -> 27386.75s]  Nothing else to say
[27386.91s -> 27388.91s]  short to short and mad
[27402.61s -> 27405.15s]  Yeah, that was a pedestrian flash
[27406.41s -> 27410.41s]  It is she as well. Oh, yeah, it's it's a plethora a plethora of
[27411.13s -> 27418.06s]  Terrible things. I still got to go to the gym tonight, too
[27418.06s -> 27445.33s]  Zed's bot, okay.
[27446.21s -> 27449.77s]  I'm a little nervous of like getting flanked, right?
[27449.77s -> 27469.12s]  Their junglers could just like sit in places.
[27469.12s -> 27470.94s]  Nice, we got top and him, not bad.
[27471.96s -> 27474.16s]  Yeah, I mean, we just try and get mid and hip here.
[27475.62s -> 27498.42s]  Whoa, let's go help our homie though.
[27498.42s -> 27501.04s]  Like I'm actually so sad, I'm playing so bad.
[27502.32s -> 27503.76s]  Like I was playing so good at the start
[27503.76s -> 27505.46s]  and now I'm playing so bad.
[27505.46s -> 27506.82s]  That actually makes me sad.
[27506.82s -> 27517.49s]  I was tanking for that guy
[27518.33s -> 27544.57s]  Alright, let's just leave. I don't want to I don't want to throw the game for my teammates cuz like I'm getting like, you know
[27546.99s -> 27583.04s]  I've already died five times like a dipshit. Oh, where'd he go? We should just push bot honestly
[27584.66s -> 27596.04s]  We don't even need this dragon
[27596.04s -> 27598.04s]  Okay, we should I'm just gonna push bot
[27643.96s -> 27658.66s]  Not bad
[27658.66s -> 27663.32s]  Not bad at all. I gotta give it. I want to give it to night blue, but I gotta give it to this Lulu
[27664.24s -> 27671.31s]  Lulu played that game so good. I gotta give it to Lulu. She played so fucking good
[27676.06s -> 27693.61s]  Like actually, I don't even know if she's still in here
[27712.60s -> 27721.93s]  I'm not a scripter
[27721.97s -> 27724.13s]  She thinks I'm a scripter. No, I'm serious
[27732.61s -> 27734.61s]  She thinks I'm a scripter
[27739.22s -> 27758.72s]  Bro, I'm streaming
[27758.72s -> 27761.72s]  Dude, the homie thought I'm a scripter.
[27761.72s -> 27765.60s]  You know, I'll take it.
[27765.60s -> 27767.24s]  My ego feels good.
[27767.24s -> 27777.51s]  Honestly, that feels good.
[27777.51s -> 27778.51s]  That feels good.
[27778.51s -> 27779.51s]  Hi, Will.
[27779.51s -> 27784.92s]  Thought I was a scripter.
[27784.92s -> 27786.72s]  Dude, I'm not gonna lie though.
[27786.72s -> 27790.44s]  Some of those movements were sus as fuck that I was making.
[27790.44s -> 27795.12s]  I turned on the fucking mental scripts for that game.
[27795.12s -> 27800.68s]  Some of those movements early were nuts.
[27800.68s -> 27806.76s]  like this tiny little tiny little movements I was doing early game and lane were crazy
[27806.76s -> 27818.01s]  like look at this watch this like this movement right here right like look I dodged that right
[27818.01s -> 27832.50s]  then I walk up cleanse the thing kite down like that that movement is gross man look
[27832.50s -> 27839.20s]  that was actually some gross ass movement I'm not gonna lie look at this in the corner
[27839.20s -> 27851.96s]  man in the corner my brain was like yo andromeda thank you man yo you played really good now
[27851.96s -> 27858.72s]  i felt bad i felt so bad because i was griefing like i was like at the start of the game we
[27858.72s -> 27863.92s]  were just snow like i i literally fucked up like three times during like the really important
[27863.92s -> 27878.57s]  fights and i was like oh no yo thank you for the bits can i play kalista uh i can i'm trying
[27878.57s -> 27889.93s]  figure out if i want to play a kalista game or if i want to go make dinner there was one other
[27889.93s -> 27894.57s]  movement that i thought was kind of nuts i did a really good movement to somewhere i don't remember
[27894.57s -> 27904.06s]  what it was here's where i fucked up so right now i should have just been i for some reason my brain
[27904.06s -> 27909.58s]  lagged and i should have just been sitting here um i should have just cleansed and then started
[27909.58s -> 27914.70s]  fighting the twitch for some reason i didn't cleanse but this wasn't like your fault at all
[27914.70s -> 27919.98s]  Like I the second the twitch flashed I should have insta cleansed the ignite and I should have been killing him
[27920.70s -> 27923.26s]  Like right now just like autoing because I can't get away from him, right?
[27923.74s -> 27926.70s]  But it took me an extra second. See how I I start fighting him now
[27929.85s -> 27936.17s]  Like I barely died. I wouldn't have died had I cleansed and had I just turned initially it was fine
[27941.88s -> 27946.12s]  And then like here I fucked up too because I went in and I thought we were six
[27954.56s -> 27956.56s]  Oh, I could have killed that guy
[27956.56s -> 27960.80s]  I should have gone forward one more. Oh, you know what? I should have done there
[27960.80s -> 27965.84s]  I should have gone forward one more auto killed this guy Lulu would have gotten six off of the kill
[27965.84s -> 27970.52s]  I would have used my speed to come back out then she could have ulted me. We could have killed the
[27971.56s -> 27974.56s]  We could have got the twitch and then we could have turned on this echo, too. Oh
[27981.82s -> 27984.34s]  This was a really cool 2v2. I
[27985.62s -> 27987.62s]  Actually thought this 2v2 was really sick
[27992.51s -> 27996.67s]  Lulu's a real one for this man. Listen, you're a real one for this one
[27996.99s -> 27999.83s]  You just took the death to save me.
[27999.83s -> 28005.50s]  Respect.
[28005.50s -> 28007.70s]  You're a real one for that.
[28007.70s -> 28014.05s]  That was so good.
[28014.05s -> 28020.39s]  GGs was fun?
[28020.39s -> 28021.35s]  Yeah, GGs.
[28021.35s -> 28022.75s]  You were the best support I've had today.
[28022.75s -> 28025.55s]  Like legitimately, you played better than all the other players
[28025.55s -> 28026.39s]  in the silo.
[28026.39s -> 28027.43s]  That was really good.
[28027.43s -> 28028.53s]  Like I was surprised.
[28028.53s -> 28029.69s]  I was telling my stream, I was like, yeah.
[28029.69s -> 28032.03s]  She's actually like, they...
[28032.03s -> 28033.57s]  I said she because you're a Lulu.
[28033.57s -> 28034.47s]  I don't know, you know.
[28034.47s -> 28035.43s]  But I was like, yeah.
[28035.43s -> 28037.77s]  She's playing super good.
[28037.77s -> 28039.57s]  She's playing way better than all of my fucking teammates.
[28039.57s -> 28050.94s]  Yo, uh, what time is it? It's six. Man, do I want to, do I want to keep streaming or
[28050.94s -> 28057.48s]  do I want to go to, or do I want to go get food and go to the gym? I can't like 24 hour
[28057.48s -> 28062.08s]  fitness is not actually 24 anymore. So I'd have to go soon if I'm going to go to the
[28062.08s -> 28086.06s]  gym, but it is only like six. Hmm. But I could just end on, I could just end on the hitting
[28086.06s -> 28094.03s]  the like 400 LP mark and just chill for now right like we hit 400 LP we'll probably hit GM tomorrow
[28095.87s -> 28103.71s]  so I could just chill for now and then we can just hit GM tomorrow that's probably a better idea
[28103.71s -> 28108.03s]  because then I won't get mad like say say we get like like say we get another game like this right
[28109.63s -> 28113.71s]  like say we get another game like this where like we're literally winning the game and my
[28113.71s -> 28117.71s]  team's like no let's forfeit like that's gonna make me mad I was mad this is gonna make me mad
[28117.71s -> 28122.75s]  right like i so i'd rather just like get off on a good note like a happy note you know like not be
[28122.75s -> 28134.26s]  tilted gm tomorrow yeah i hope so i've been i think i can get challenger back this year but
[28134.26s -> 28142.58s]  we got to get to gm first i'm telling you i this elo is so miserable like master tier is the worst
[28142.58s -> 28153.06s]  elo i've ever played in in my 12 years of playing this game whatever na 300 400 lp masters is
[28153.70s -> 28161.62s]  is literally disgusting these these are not real people like i feel like half these games we are
[28161.62s -> 28169.54s]  playing with npcs who quite literally don't even like i i don't even know what to say they're bots
[28170.58s -> 28176.02s]  and they can't be real humans they get mad over nothing they rage quit over nothing they they
[28176.02s -> 28184.69s]  they give up at 15 minutes when we're winning the game these cannot be real people so i swear to god
[28185.01s -> 28188.69s]  The game has to get better in GM. It has to get better.
[28188.69s -> 28192.29s]  There's no world that it gets worse.
[28192.29s -> 28195.33s]  Like, I refuse to believe that.
[28195.33s -> 28198.85s]  Because this is the worst grind I've ever had.
[28198.85s -> 28204.22s]  Is it bad to be a bot?
[28204.22s -> 28208.21s]  Are you saying I'm bot-ist?
[28208.21s -> 28213.30s]  Are you going to cancel me because I don't like bots?
[28213.30s -> 28216.26s]  I said it. I'm saying it. I don't like fucking bots.
[28216.26s -> 28218.90s]  Well, okay, I didn't need to add fuck.
[28218.90s -> 28220.34s]  You know what? I'm going to get off.
[28220.34s -> 28222.34s]  I'm gonna yeah, that's it. That's it for me. Uh
[28223.14s -> 28225.14s]  I'm gonna get off boys. I'm tired
[28225.62s -> 28228.74s]  I need to go to the gym before I run out of juice make some dinner
[28229.38s -> 28233.38s]  Uh, I will be live tomorrow. Same time as today. I've been starting my stream at 10 a.m
[28234.02s -> 28235.78s]  my time
[28235.78s -> 28242.90s]  Maybe i'll do it tomorrow at 9 a.m. I don't know. It's 10 or 9 1 between there. I always start my stream and so uh
[28243.70s -> 28247.06s]  And that's my time. So it's like 7 8 9 pst
[28247.06s -> 28254.26s]  you're good at ad thanks man i i think i suck my goal is hopefully i can get challenger back
[28255.30s -> 28260.82s]  and then i'm not gonna play like i i just want to my goal is challenger so that i can prove to
[28260.82s -> 28266.82s]  myself it's a really stupid thing but i i want to prove to myself that i can still do it at 32
[28267.38s -> 28270.98s]  because 10 years ago was the first time i started streaming this year right i've been streaming for
[28270.98s -> 28276.74s]  10 years this year and so i want to get challenger because when i first started streaming i was in
[28276.74s -> 28283.46s]  Challenger and I want to see if like after 10 years I can still do it and then I'm never gonna care again
[28284.34s -> 28287.16s]  This will be the only time I ever give a shit about getting Challenger
[28287.16s -> 28290.70s]  I just want to get it see if I care and then play for content, you know
[28292.30s -> 28296.52s]  But uh, yeah, it's just it's just like welcome to the League of Draven
[28297.36s -> 28300.78s]  see if the old man who has fucking arthritis and
[28301.54s -> 28305.10s]  Fucking carpal tunnel and all that shit. You know what I mean? Yeah, I still do it
[28305.10s -> 28310.86s]  Yo, thank you for the Twitch Prime, man. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Appreciate
[28310.86s -> 28314.22s]  it a lot, dude. Alright, guys, that's gonna be it for me. If you like the stream, don't
[28314.22s -> 28318.30s]  forget to follow all my socials and TikTok and Facebook and Instagram and all that shit.
[28318.30s -> 28322.58s]  All the clickable garbage is underneath the stream. Don't forget to check it out. I'll
[28322.58s -> 28327.70s]  be back tomorrow, same time in the morning. I, tomorrow's my last day for the weekend
[28327.70s -> 28331.54s]  though. I'm not going to stream on Saturday. I might do some off, off stream grinding on
[28331.54s -> 28335.32s]  I've been taking I've been like forcing myself to take a day off of streaming
[28335.78s -> 28341.36s]  Every week just so like I can mentally recharge and I think it's actually been really good for my stream
[28341.76s -> 28345.72s]  Because like I've been in a much better mood while streaming and I've been much less tilted and I've been
[28346.72s -> 28352.32s]  Even if I play League off stream or whatever, it's just like it doesn't feel as forced. So I feel like the breaks nice
[28352.32s -> 28357.60s]  So yeah tomorrow no stream on Saturday tomorrow for sure and Sunday. I might I might do a short stream
[28358.00s -> 28361.12s]  But yeah, I'll see you guys then. Thanks for watching. I appreciate you guys
[28361.54s -> 28370.58s]  And yeah, that's it. I'm gonna go make dinner. I hope you guys have a good night day wherever the fuck you are
[28371.30s -> 28376.58s]  Later dudes. Hope you guys have a good one. It was fun playing with it Andromeda. Good luck on the games
