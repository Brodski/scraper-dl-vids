[190.19s -> 196.58s]  Yeah, guy has G.P.
[207.60s -> 208.60s]  Bees.
[215.22s -> 216.72s]  Jesus.
[254.21s -> 255.81s]  Yo, eh, what's up man?
[270.13s -> 271.13s]  What's up dudes?
[318.98s -> 320.98s]  Yeah, I mean we're hoping.
[325.65s -> 327.41s]  We'll see man, we'll see.
[330.21s -> 331.81s]  Fingers fucking cross, right?
[389.61s -> 391.91s]  Do I ever actually...
[405.53s -> 406.73s]  I'm wondering if I...
[406.73s -> 408.53s]  I'm assuming I'm just playing a math.
[461.42s -> 463.44s]  Yo, where, yay!
[475.46s -> 478.02s]  Yeah, this is probably just me doing fucking...
[478.30s -> 484.36s]  I'm probably just doing Star Guardian.
[498.34s -> 502.48s]  Well come to the wall. It's never on time for the 27-months man, you're a
[503.46s -> 530.88s]  Appreciate the lot dude. Thank you, and I could probably still go in finneteen, but it's my hold in the solution
[531.68s -> 533.68s]  But I haven't seen any sever or anything
[534.80s -> 619.63s]  So I'd be kind of awkward, you know, this guy's definitely gonna be me. That guy's
[620.83s -> 624.83s]  I see why he hasn't lost. That's just five infinity team already Jesus Christ
[624.83s -> 751.74s]  I was like man, why is that guy so strong and then I realized so I go to seven next rounds
[778.74s -> 806.08s]  and then hopefully we could hit some shit. I kind of like this actually because now we can make
[807.84s -> 842.30s]  I can actually make a guard breaker and I can also make a guard breaker and math. I kind of want
[842.30s -> 848.72s]  I want to just ionize Spark, but I don't know if I should.
[848.72s -> 854.00s]  I need an echo, a Nico, or a Ral.
[854.00s -> 856.20s]  That's what could use an Ezreal.
[856.20s -> 857.76s]  I need a quick draw.
[857.76s -> 861.36s]  I should have kept that moosh in from earlier.
[861.36s -> 949.60s]  This guy's a level 3 Blitzcrank and he's just so fucking strong that's stupid.
[949.60s -> 950.60s]  This is really interesting.
[950.60s -> 958.08s]  I guess I could go spell-singer as well.
[958.08s -> 1041.90s]  And we just give the shiv to TF, we just do this for now too, I guess I could use I could do dual gauntlet
[1041.90s -> 1104.85s]  I don't know could dual gauntlet this shit up, there it goes, I need to like throw an item down
[1104.85s -> 1118.20s]  But I feel like Morrell is bad, I guess I could just use hat or I guess I would have
[1118.20s -> 1128.10s]  before Jold got it, could be good.
[1128.10s -> 1147.04s]  Oh no, I could just roll on seven, two,
[1147.04s -> 1152.74s]  try and three stars stuff.
[1152.74s -> 1154.94s]  This guy has three kises though.
[1154.94s -> 1159.66s]  This guy has one kise.
[1159.66s -> 1160.98s]  Kind of hard to three star kise.
[1160.98s -> 1190.74s]  I could three star niva.
[1190.74s -> 1193.54s]  Like I said, eight with fucking 20 gold,
[1195.34s -> 1196.54s]  here he has MF,
[1197.86s -> 1354.40s]  and he'd, what's great since saying,
[1354.40s -> 1356.40s]  you that NAR just murked me.
[1357.48s -> 1359.04s]  I did not position for the NAR,
[1359.04s -> 1371.22s]  And I got fucked for it.
[1371.22s -> 1399.32s]  This motherfucker.
[1399.32s -> 1402.82s]  Should I wish I could get some stick frontline leveled up?
[1402.82s -> 1404.82s]  That'd be cool.
[1430.78s -> 1460.07s]  Oh my god, another NAR.
[1460.07s -> 1543.51s]  Well, rip.
[1543.51s -> 1547.51s]  I wasn't going to go MF and then I decided to go Nico and then I just fucked it all up.
[1547.51s -> 1551.53s]  Oh, wow.
[1551.53s -> 1572.70s]  Time is it 10?
[1597.10s -> 1599.10s]  Oh
[1618.83s -> 1620.83s]  What's up boys?
[1620.83s -> 1645.38s]  That's how everybody doing. Oh, I'll be right back. So I'm still waking up with me. Give me one sec.
[1646.58s -> 1648.58s]  Subscribe
[1674.70s -> 1676.70s]  Okay
[1676.70s -> 1679.76s]  Oh
[1679.76s -> 1683.04s]  Yeah, baby. I wasn't gonna play on my main at the start, but dude
[1683.04s -> 1687.28s]  I don't know if I can sit through fucking 8 minute queue times to get people raging at each other all day
[1687.84s -> 1703.90s]  So we'll do some warm-up on this account for a bit, what of Mars's count?
[1703.90s -> 1706.38s]  Like D1, Bo Master.
[1706.38s -> 1717.54s]  Like, by their accounts, like 500, this one's, I want to say like,
[1717.54s -> 1721.34s]  I don't know, the animal is really awkward when you get like,
[1721.34s -> 1723.78s]  well, masters, right? Like, the animal is super awkward.
[1723.78s -> 1726.50s]  So I don't know what the animal is, but I know it's a little masters.
[1726.50s -> 1728.82s]  So like, sometimes there's, sometimes there's, like,
[1728.82s -> 1732.66s]  100 LP players, somewhere between there.
[1732.66s -> 1741.76s]  Dude, I
[1741.76s -> 1744.64s]  I put some games off stream yesterday. I got up to like 400 LP
[1745.76s -> 1756.06s]  Then I've lost three in a row. That shit was painful. I did
[1756.70s -> 1774.50s]  Into one of tenacity's games though, so that was fun. That felt bad. No, yeah straight up. It felt so bad. He was doing so good to like I straight up
[1774.50s -> 1782.05s]  Just had a bad game and I felt I felt like shit. I'll be this shit. I just dropped like eight deaths. Look at the shits
[1782.05s -> 1791.05s]  But he was just straight up smurfing on the enemy top laner and we all the entire team
[1791.05s -> 1802.54s]  just like decided to collectively run it down, like we all just got shit on.
[1802.54s -> 1809.89s]  This was a really weird game because I feel like that game was like the first game I felt
[1809.89s -> 1814.89s]  everybody in the game was like actually high GM challenger but they weren't rated that.
[1814.89s -> 1822.66s]  It's a very weird system going on.
[1822.66s -> 1829.94s]  Let's do a Cassiope again.
[1829.94s -> 1831.94s]  But all of us know you guys what I mean in a second.
[1831.94s -> 1839.09s]  I'm assuming I should go this, right?
[1839.09s -> 1846.11s]  This is probably good.
[1846.11s -> 1848.11s]  Or this?
[1848.11s -> 1849.11s]  That's probably good too.
[1849.11s -> 1855.46s]  Oh, well.
[1855.46s -> 1858.46s]  Okay, so, yeah, look at this stuff.
[1858.46s -> 1863.46s]  Like, Nian Tonso is like, he's been challenging for a long time, right?
[1863.46s -> 1866.46s]  I don't even know who the fuck this guy was.
[1866.46s -> 1875.86s]  some random sent a player who's like not playing sent a no and then this guy was like trying to jungle and just like running it down
[1877.86s -> 1880.86s]  it was I don't even know it was the weirdest game that I've played in a while
[1882.86s -> 1885.86s]  because like my 80 carry wasn't bad
[1885.86s -> 1890.86s]  like this guy is clearly like honest Murphy but I don't know how good he was because he wasn't bad at the game
[1891.86s -> 1893.86s]  the enemy 80 carry wasn't bad
[1893.86s -> 1896.86s]  This guy's also on a smurf.
[1896.86s -> 1898.86s]  It was the weirdest lobby.
[1898.86s -> 1900.86s]  It was like a bunch of smurf accounts.
[1900.86s -> 1908.09s]  All playing with each other, but it was like a non smurf queue.
[1908.09s -> 1910.09s]  This guy was like the only non smurf.
[1910.09s -> 1922.97s]  It was interesting.
[1922.97s -> 1923.97s]  Ooh, do I take ghost here?
[1923.97s -> 1924.97s]  Or do I just...
[1924.97s -> 1929.97s]  I think ghost could be really OP versus their team with Cassiopea,
[1929.97s -> 1930.97s]  but maybe I should just take...
[1930.97s -> 1940.04s]  I'm gonna try it.
[1940.04s -> 1943.54s]  I don't know. Somebody dodged.
[1943.54s -> 1946.74s]  Because yeah, I don't know. I never know. I don't remember what you think Ghost Ignite, whatever.
[1948.74s -> 1952.66s]  Because I feel Ghost with Casios feels like the same exact Ecarot, right? Same idea.
[1953.30s -> 1966.76s]  Where it feels really OP. Dude, there's so much drama going on in the lead community yet again.
[1967.48s -> 2006.78s]  By the way, it's, it's insane. Yeah, I don't know, man. I, I just, I'm, I like, I like looking at drama
[2006.78s -> 2016.76s]  because like drama is juicy like I like looking at drama, but it's also like how are people so stupid?
[2033.62s -> 2035.62s]  Yeah, I'm getting like I
[2036.18s -> 2043.78s]  I don't know man my view on all of this shit is like I guess I'm just not hardwired that way
[2043.78s -> 2051.22s]  I can't mentally wrap my head around being like excited the fort with underage girls or like when like
[2051.86s -> 2057.48s]  I just I've never like had the want
[2057.48s -> 2067.39s]  But it happens so much between the League Streamers and non-Leges.
[2067.39s -> 2068.39s]  It's not even a League thing.
[2068.39s -> 2069.39s]  It's just that we're in the League community, right?
[2069.39s -> 2070.39s]  So you see it more.
[2070.39s -> 2076.39s]  Dude, the drama is like a decent-sized League Streamer,
[2076.39s -> 2079.39s]  who is like getting bigger, whatever, like the 80-carry streamer,
[2079.39s -> 2081.39s]  cookie, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2081.39s -> 2089.39s]  He was like, somebody made a 90-page, 90 pages of Google Docs.
[2089.39s -> 2094.40s]  To basically like expose this guy for like
[2095.12s -> 2097.60s]  Talking a bunch like sexually to underage girls
[2098.16s -> 2103.72s]  Not paying as fucking like mods who do work for him and like other stuff and I'm like there
[2111.76s -> 2118.24s]  How man like just be a normal human
[2118.64s -> 2125.40s]  It's not that bad like I take it for me being a normal dude. It's not that bad
[2200.21s -> 2202.45s]  Sorry, I was distracted. No, I
[2202.45s -> 2208.17s]  Yeah, I don't know man. I swear to God people are just stupid as fuck people are idiots
[2210.13s -> 2215.57s]  There's gotta be some psychological underline issue with people's brains not working, but it is what it is
[2218.90s -> 2221.30s]  Huh, I found this book I look out for a while
[2225.14s -> 2231.09s]  Dude, what is that tarry skin?
[2231.49s -> 2237.46s]  To see this we just tarry skin, man. He's fabulous
[2238.54s -> 2240.54s]  God there
[2240.74s -> 2243.14s]  My man, it's just straight of fabulous.
[2243.14s -> 2257.72s]  People are desperate.
[2258.72s -> 2260.38s]  I just can't, I don't think,
[2260.38s -> 2263.22s]  I've been in the situation where I was like a really,
[2263.22s -> 2266.22s]  really big streamer, much bigger than he is.
[2266.22s -> 2270.02s]  And I got, this is what I'm saying is I understand.
[2272.02s -> 2274.54s]  Like, all of the crap that gets thrown at you,
[2274.54s -> 2277.06s]  like people will literally message you for no reason.
[2277.06s -> 2280.02s]  Like you do have fans that have,
[2280.02s -> 2281.62s]  like, when I was at my biggest point,
[2281.62s -> 2284.26s]  like you have fans that are younger.
[2284.26s -> 2286.10s]  Girls guy, it doesn't matter.
[2286.10s -> 2287.42s]  And like you just gotta like,
[2287.42s -> 2289.54s]  I just never in my mind I guess thought like,
[2289.54s -> 2290.82s]  oh, I'm gonna flirt with these people.
[2290.82s -> 2292.90s]  Like it made me like,
[2292.90s -> 2294.26s]  I don't even, I wouldn't even,
[2294.26s -> 2302.93s]  I literally didn't even see them as like sexual in my brain.
[2302.93s -> 2307.32s]  Like it blows my mind.
[2307.32s -> 2309.04s]  And then the fact that like,
[2309.04s -> 2312.36s]  if you look at the Google Doc or whatever,
[2312.36s -> 2314.08s]  the fact that like talk,
[2314.08s -> 2315.16s]  like I keep a talk or whatever,
[2315.16s -> 2316.92s]  was literally talking to him,
[2316.92s -> 2320.12s]  Telling him he was doing it like what he was doing was wrong. He was like, yeah, I get it, right?
[2320.72s -> 2333.06s]  Then he did it again
[2333.06s -> 2336.26s]  Dude the set-alting the pussy that
[2337.50s -> 2340.34s]  I'll be on it that maybe one of the funny lines I've ever heard
[2355.06s -> 2360.38s]  Like dude, I mean whatever, you know, I'm not here to kink shame whatever gets people off, you know, maybe maybe
[2360.90s -> 2362.90s]  That's a fetish. I don't know
[2392.65s -> 2394.49s]  one, one, one, one, one.
[2394.49s -> 2395.09s]  One, one, one, one.
[2395.09s -> 2396.65s]  Safe and sounds.
[2399.24s -> 2400.40s]  Either way.
[2401.32s -> 2403.36s]  Don't worry, we cannot talk about the drama real quick.
[2404.04s -> 2409.28s]  We could talk about how old and washed up wings of that is though.
[2426.51s -> 2427.51s]  I'm kidding.
[2432.71s -> 2434.27s]  Yo, did you see on a wider note though.
[2434.27s -> 2435.35s]  Did you see Riot?
[2436.11s -> 2438.07s]  There was like a Reddit thread or something,
[2438.07s -> 2442.63s]  where Riot was saying that they're like gonna try and do something about smurfing in the next few months.
[2444.49s -> 2446.09s]  I don't know what that means.
[2447.29s -> 2463.65s]  But he's always something involving wings just between us. Yeah, just between us and all the homies. Yeah, and chat. Yeah, nobody else anything. It's fine. Yeah, no
[2467.22s -> 2503.46s]  What's up? My chat ain't snitches. When I was a teen, I made a montage of him having breakdowns in my games. Oh my god
[2504.22s -> 2519.34s]  That's amazing. Oh my god. That's amazing. I feel like I need to pay you to see this montage. Like I will give you money
[2519.34s -> 2548.29s]  I need this this is important to me. Oh, I have a dude. You should see the I have so many rage
[2548.29s -> 2565.55s]  compilations about me. It's crazy. So many. I had a I had a a Velonark for sure. I feel
[2565.55s -> 2575.92s]  you just comes with like being a league streamer. League players are not all mentally healthy.
[2575.92s -> 2592.05s]  Let me let me tell you. Thank you for me. Add okay. I'd like to think I'm not a villain anymore.
[2592.05s -> 2624.98s]  Fuck you. I really want this play it. Nice dude. Maybe he is roaming. Why is there a
[2624.98s -> 2637.85s]  Woocon just sitting top by the way? That's actually hilarious. You know what's interesting?
[2637.85s -> 2648.74s]  I feel like Terric actually missed that stun. I was kind of side-eyeing that but I feel like
[2648.74s -> 2674.06s]  he missed that stun somehow. I feel like this is the easiest game I've ever played by the
[2674.06s -> 2681.02s]  I'm on full autopilot rain still waking up and I feel like they're just walking into me on repeat
[2681.02s -> 2683.90s]  I'm just killing them all. I don't even know what the fuck's going on
[2685.66s -> 2689.98s]  My day it feels like the enemy team has not like they didn't they didn't like understand
[2689.98s -> 2693.66s]  We were playing league right like they queued up and they were like oh, yeah, this is league
[2695.10s -> 2697.10s]  That's what this feels like
[2697.82s -> 2701.66s]  This is what I imagine if I mic Tyson went into a preschool, you know, and I mean like this is what this feels like
[2701.66s -> 2738.46s]  I probably could have killed those guys, but I don't want to have a chill.
[2738.46s -> 2762.31s]  I'm assuming the wolf on is gonna come bot soon. There he is.
[2762.31s -> 2766.31s]  Damn it, I quence late. I actually killed Bull.
[2766.31s -> 2769.31s]  That's a late quence by me.
[2769.31s -> 2774.31s]  I don't want to take the risk of coming back up.
[2774.31s -> 2777.31s]  She stuns me, they can one shot me.
[2777.31s -> 2779.31s]  I should have killed the fucking guy though
[2780.95s -> 2785.27s]  The Wukong I just backed up too far and then I coined the son for not like really late
[2794.88s -> 2802.00s]  I just it was a man so boys good evening good evening good morning. I don't know where the fuck you guys live so good day
[2815.11s -> 2825.91s]  Fuck about watching
[2825.91s -> 2827.91s]  Wait that Wukong lived
[2832.88s -> 2837.26s]  Whoa, bro. Oh, I'm dead
[2839.22s -> 2841.22s]  Dude that wall was BS
[2843.06s -> 2847.38s]  There was like a little hole and then I flashed the light because I was like, oh, I could walk out the hole
[2847.78s -> 2852.98s]  But I couldn't walk out the tiny little hole. I'm not a buckers
[2854.22s -> 2862.65s]  I shouldn't have even been there, but like I'm stupid. I should have just pushed bot
[2862.65s -> 2866.41s]  I was like dude, that's such a bad fight, but I walked over to those like I'm really thin
[2867.53s -> 2870.77s]  Honestly, I probably could have killed them if I didn't if I had like flashed the
[2872.05s -> 2876.80s]  It's done any stunts the only
[2876.80s -> 2881.80s]  Like, most over, like, I swear if they reduced Andy's done by like,
[2881.80s -> 2884.80s]  point five seconds, she would never get played.
[2884.80s -> 2889.80s]  Like, actually the only reason to play Annie is that her stun is just so
[2889.80s -> 2894.80s]  OP, because it's like, it's like the reason they changed Terrix a long ago,
[2894.80s -> 2902.46s]  where like, when you have a point click, CC, it's typically really broken.
[2902.46s -> 2913.30s]  Okay, I'm just dead.
[2913.30s -> 2943.06s]  There's Terric not have old leveled up at six. He didn't level his ulti. Maybe it's maybe Terric old sucks.
[2943.06s -> 2948.37s]  Maybe it's under power. You know?
[2948.37s -> 2950.37s]  Now yeah, he must have missed quick.
[2950.37s -> 2962.78s]  Honestly, I'm just breathing. I'm like playing too aggro for like.
[2962.78s -> 2967.78s]  Like I threw my lead because I was like, oh shit, I'm going to walk over and help the homies.
[2967.78s -> 2970.78s]  You never walk over and help the homies when the homies are getting shit on because
[2970.78s -> 2972.78s]  because uh...
[2972.78s -> 2975.34s]  if you have like nine hundred gold or a thousand gold but you'd like it like
[2975.34s -> 2978.14s]  i'd enter whatever you don't want to do that's because
[2978.14s -> 2979.34s]  you'll give
[2979.34s -> 2983.76s]  mf at ton of kills
[2983.76s -> 2994.46s]  we're in a good spot now though
[2994.46s -> 2996.62s]  but i am still a little
[2996.62s -> 3000.93s]  wait terrac-oh we've all the salt matters
[3000.93s -> 3005.55s]  this terrac just not know how to play terrac by the way
[3005.55s -> 3011.23s]  he's thrown out his stone so awkwardly
[3011.23s -> 3018.59s]  that's okay though i mean i apparently don't know how to play dragon so
[3018.59s -> 3025.23s]  I can't really believe in the guy.
[3025.23s -> 3031.61s]  I mean, you guys are doing dragon with no smite.
[3031.61s -> 3045.01s]  But it seems like doing dragon with no smite.
[3045.01s -> 3052.56s]  I mean, we could fight these fights, but it's like painful.
[3052.56s -> 3056.27s]  We could easily fight these fights.
[3056.27s -> 3058.59s]  I think a lot of it is just like,
[3058.59s -> 3061.67s]  Tarrick isn't confident enough to walk up and stun.
[3061.67s -> 3063.87s]  That's what I'm seeing the issue is.
[3063.87s -> 3065.87s]  He's doing the thing where he's not,
[3065.87s -> 3067.39s]  he doesn't have the confidence to actually walk up
[3067.39s -> 3072.05s]  since he's a melee champ.
[3072.05s -> 3075.53s]  So he's walking up in like taking half his health.
[3075.53s -> 3077.81s]  And it's making him nervous.
[3077.81s -> 3082.81s]  It happens a lot with players who are very melee champ centric.
[3084.33s -> 3085.97s]  Because melee supports are actually pretty risky.
[3085.97s -> 3097.90s]  Are they pretty scary, rather?
[3097.90s -> 3099.18s]  Oh, he's totally dead.
[3099.18s -> 3100.58s]  Oh, no, we're not.
[3100.58s -> 3103.06s]  But yeah, melee supports are scary to play
[3103.06s -> 3106.98s]  because you have to know when you can get a kill by going in
[3106.98s -> 3110.26s]  because you're going to take damage, right?
[3110.26s -> 3116.99s]  That's just like the nature of melee supports.
[3116.99s -> 3117.83s]  Nice.
[3118.83s -> 3121.47s]  We're coming back in a bit, not bad.
[3121.47s -> 3124.27s]  We threw a little bit early, but yeah, we're starting to get it back.
[3124.27s -> 3127.58s]  We're chill.
[3127.58s -> 3129.06s]  Tanks are never gonna.
[3129.06s -> 3132.18s]  I'm always confused by Terric because he feels like
[3132.18s -> 3135.22s]  such a good champion, like the champion itself feels broken
[3135.22s -> 3136.06s]  as shit.
[3137.86s -> 3140.66s]  Like whatever I see, Terric, I think to myself like,
[3140.66s -> 3145.66s]  the
[3145.66s -> 3147.66s]  he's either uncaly like super OP or
[3147.66s -> 3149.66s]  they're like
[3149.66s -> 3151.66s]  oh and 10
[3151.66s -> 3155.66s]  there's no in between right like they either know how to play terracare they know is what it feels like
[3155.66s -> 3174.32s]  oh you're I mean yeah you're wrong terracare actually requires mechanics
[3174.32s -> 3177.32s]  that's actually true
[3177.32s -> 3181.24s]  supports like not of us doesn't have mechanics you know and like what's correct
[3181.24s -> 3185.40s]  doesn't have mechanics they just hit their button and if it if it works they they
[3185.40s -> 3190.92s]  get a kill or it's like taric after you stun there is like stuff you have to do
[3190.92s -> 3219.35s]  that doesn't make sense or block do you think um oh I'm gonna die oh thank god do you
[3219.35s -> 3225.99s]  think taric's one of the harder supports I think he's pretty hard but I don't think
[3225.99s -> 3232.99s]  He's, well, I mean, he's harder than the other supports, like, I think like, I don't think there's a single support that's hard.
[3232.99s -> 3241.35s]  I know, I'm, I'm toxic for that, but I stand by it.
[3241.35s -> 3258.76s]  Oh, I mean, I'm just gonna die. I'm not gonna turn flash.
[3258.76s -> 3263.76s]  I don't think I should have just flashed over, but I kind of got baited by the terracult.
[3263.76s -> 3267.76s]  I wanted to see if I could fight, but there's too much to see.
[3267.76s -> 3272.14s]  I was like, oh, he's holding me. Let's go.
[3272.14s -> 3275.90s]  I can tell this is a really low-Elo game because there's so much random deaths.
[3275.90s -> 3279.10s]  Like, I'm following victim to like, I'm auto-pivoting.
[3279.10s -> 3283.54s]  And like, I'm not thinking, and I'm just talking to you guys, and I'm just dying for free.
[3283.54s -> 3287.70s]  But it's like, there's so many people who's dying for free. It's hilarious.
[3287.70s -> 3290.38s]  Thresh? Thresh isn't actually that farmed.
[3290.38s -> 3295.70s]  So, like, a lot of people think like, the rush mechanically is very difficult,
[3295.70s -> 3300.02s]  because he is harder than the other supports, but he's not actually that hard.
[3300.02s -> 3308.66s]  He's like, once you learn the thrash combos, he's pretty much a very upfront champion.
[3308.66s -> 3321.52s]  Yeah, like, like Lantern, for example, is one of the most broken things to ever be put
[3321.52s -> 3324.36s]  in league and everybody fucks it up.
[3324.36s -> 3328.36s]  Like people will just mess up Lantern because they'll throw it for souls or they'll mess up.
[3328.36s -> 3335.40s]  Like, you can literally just hold Lantern perma and your AD carry can walk up, auto the
[3335.40s -> 3348.52s]  And you literally like they literally can't play the game after that. Like the enemy team I mean because like there's nothing they can do to stop it
[3349.08s -> 3352.46s]  We can totally fight this by the way
[3353.36s -> 3358.68s]  So I got done that before we're like my thrash where I know I have a good throw hold on me when this team fight really quick
[3360.44s -> 3384.30s]  Give me second
[3384.30s -> 3389.98s]  Okay, so I had the one that team power part. Okay, so as I was saying there's a lot more to thrash than
[3391.18s -> 3393.18s]  People think right
[3393.18s -> 3398.18s]  It's essentially people over-complicate like what he needs to do so it's like
[3398.18s -> 3402.98s]  Thresh is a very basic like when you see Thresh in pro play you you don't ever see like what you do
[3402.98s -> 3404.98s]  But it's very rare that you see like sick
[3404.98s -> 3410.38s]  Permal-hooking like oh my god like it's mainly like they pick him for like lantern
[3411.38s -> 3414.58s]  It's right up like when they pick Thresh and hi-lo
[3414.58s -> 3422.38s]  He's not picked to be the god tier like always landing permacese hooks like play god like he's picked to like shut down and gauge and
[3423.18s -> 3425.78s]  uh... remove
[3425.78s -> 3431.04s]  kill threat to your carries that's always picked for
[3431.04s -> 3435.19s]  but he's literally just an e-dw one
[3435.19s -> 3438.63s]  armor stacking i mean yeah the armor thing on thresh is nice but it's i wouldn't
[3438.63s -> 3442.77s]  say it's like opionus kit
[3442.77s -> 3450.22s]  it just makes him like not died to eighty carries in two seconds
[3450.22s -> 3453.78s]  what is happening
[3453.78s -> 3457.62s]  but i instantly know on point with a good thrash player when i can walk up to the
[3457.62s -> 3461.80s]  turret
[3461.80s -> 3475.92s]  uh... when i can walk up to the turret and the threat
[3475.92s -> 3481.38s]  I was trying to think and talk at the same time when I go walk up to the turret my thrash player won't walk up and out of the turret with me
[3481.38s -> 3483.38s]  That's like the sign of a good thrash player
[3483.94s -> 3487.98s]  When we don't know where the enemy is and instead of walking up and trying to hit the turret
[3487.98s -> 3493.70s]  I like help you kill the turret. They'll stand in the back and literally just sit there and wait and hold lantern until
[3496.82s -> 3498.82s]  They just hold their lantern until like you can
[3499.74s -> 3501.74s]  Into a gigant essentially
[3504.51s -> 3508.81s]  And that's why I I just personally don't think the rush is mechanics. There's hardest people think
[3508.81s -> 3513.45s]  I do think he's he's very knowledge based like I think Russia has high knowledge caps
[3514.09s -> 3519.73s]  Where like if you're playing I don't know like Lulu your skill is basically like do I
[3519.73s -> 3527.41s]  W your decision make on Lulu is literally do I W to speed or do I W to CC right like that's your that's your decision making
[3527.61s -> 3529.61s]  So it's like obviously much higher than that
[3530.73s -> 3532.73s]  But it's a
[3534.33s -> 3536.17s]  You've son of a bitch
[3536.17s -> 3538.17s]  But it's still not like that bad
[3538.17s -> 3545.93s]  I think Thresh just intimidates people because he can do so much and so I think people just get
[3545.93s -> 3554.56s]  intimidated but because they think it looks overwhelming to learn the champ. I feel like that
[3554.56s -> 3560.16s]  actually intimidates a lot of people in terms of like people not wanting to learn new champions
[3560.16s -> 3568.24s]  chips. I feel like a lot of it is just people are nervous about learning champions that look
[3568.24s -> 3570.36s]  overwhelming, right?
[3570.36s -> 3574.98s]  Like a failure, for example, I was talking about this yesterday.
[3574.98s -> 3582.28s]  A failure is not a hard mechanical champion, like he's difficult in terms of the knowledge
[3582.28s -> 3586.36s]  required, like he's knowledge-gated, very hard, right?
[3586.36s -> 3591.24s]  So you have to play him a decent amount or like research him to understand what guns
[3591.24s -> 3594.80s]  do what, how to interact with the guns, stuff like that, right?
[3594.80s -> 3599.80s]  But the actual mechanics of using the guns, it's actually not hard.
[3599.80s -> 3601.80s]  Guys, what are we doing?
[3601.80s -> 3619.33s]  I guess we're just winning the fight.
[3619.33s -> 3621.77s]  Pike?
[3621.77s -> 3623.77s]  Like, I think Pike's harder than Thresh.
[3623.77s -> 3631.48s]  Maybe that's a hot take, but I think Pike is harder than Thresh.
[3631.48s -> 3637.18s]  Because Pike requires like really specific.
[3637.18s -> 3644.18s]  Pike is a lot harder to play than he looks when you see people play him.
[3644.18s -> 3649.78s]  Because there's like timers of when you can go in off of certain things like hitting his
[3649.78s -> 3655.06s]  old team consistently and team fights is a little harder than people think and knowing how to
[3655.06s -> 3661.14s]  position in the lane like pikus capable of a lot more than people think. So I think pikus, I think
[3661.14s -> 3669.89s]  the reason the main reason I think pikus a little harder is because he's made way. Like melee champions
[3669.89s -> 3675.49s]  are always going to be like mechanically more difficult than ranged. If the melee champion is like
[3675.49s -> 3682.74s]  you have to engage to go in and do stuff because there's always the counter
[3682.74s -> 3692.62s]  by factor support role. Yeah, that's what I'm saying is like I'm not saying
[3692.62s -> 3695.94s]  overall like overall range champions require a lot more mechanics than
[3695.94s -> 3699.68s]  melee just because you're ranged you can die in a global and you have to space
[3699.68s -> 3704.48s]  and stuff but I think that like in just the support support support specific I
[3704.48s -> 3708.64s]  think melee is a lot harder to play that's why you see a lot of like support
[3708.64s -> 3712.88s]  players we give like the best support players in the world are really good at
[3712.88s -> 3715.92s]  like the engaged melee supports, not the like in chanters.
[3715.92s -> 3718.88s]  And that's why you see like why we praise the best
[3718.88s -> 3723.02s]  support players because like when you see somebody
[3723.02s -> 3726.94s]  going like perfectly on Rakan or going like find a way
[3726.94s -> 3731.44s]  and without getting knocked up on like, I don't know,
[3732.56s -> 3735.52s]  something like when they find the angle on thrash
[3735.52s -> 3748.22s]  and she's it's really nice, real.
[3749.10s -> 3752.22s]  I think real sucks. I think that champ is so bad
[3752.22s -> 3760.96s]  because she just like, she doesn't do anything.
[3760.96s -> 3763.96s]  Like, Rels, Rels' initial thing was like,
[3763.96s -> 3766.96s]  she was supposed to go in, be really tanky,
[3766.96s -> 3768.96s]  and then be like a stun bot for like team fights.
[3768.96s -> 3770.96s]  She was a team fight monster.
[3770.96s -> 3772.96s]  But the problem with Rels is like,
[3772.96s -> 3775.96s]  she has one chance essentially in lane phase.
[3775.96s -> 3777.96s]  Like if anybody has fingers on their hands,
[3777.96s -> 3779.96s]  and they can move left and right,
[3779.96s -> 3781.96s]  Rels really easy to dodge.
[3781.96s -> 3784.96s]  Like it's incredibly easy to beat a Rel in lane.
[3784.96s -> 3787.24s]  and to not die to her.
[3787.24s -> 3789.40s]  Well, you just have to move less than right, right?
[3789.40s -> 3790.88s]  It's very simple.
[3790.88s -> 3796.72s]  So it's much more difficult to dodge like
[3796.72s -> 3798.36s]  other engaged champs if that makes sense.
[3798.36s -> 3800.16s]  Like, not a less, you can still move left and right,
[3800.16s -> 3802.76s]  but it's like, he can walk at you while it's happening.
[3802.76s -> 3804.72s]  Whereas like, if we're out, walks at you,
[3804.72s -> 3807.80s]  I'm still like just waiting for the animation
[3807.80s -> 3810.44s]  and then I can simply move to the left
[3810.44s -> 3814.76s]  because like her animation is so slow on using her ability
[3814.76s -> 3817.16s]  that I can like dash, I can flash, I can,
[3817.16s -> 3823.32s]  There's so much counterplay and it's like unless she flashes on you, but even then you can tell she's going to flash on you. So it's like
[3824.76s -> 3832.60s]  I also feel like mid game Relle has this issue where she has her one trick ulti engage fight in team fights,
[3832.60s -> 3843.12s]  but after she does that she does literally nothing, right? She's like a one and done. That's why like she feels like she doesn't have other
[3843.12s -> 3855.12s]  expression. She's countered so hard by the meta too. Millio counters
[3855.12s -> 3861.40s]  running gauge. Thresh counters rather than gauge. Right. Like, either either of
[3861.40s -> 3876.28s]  those champions shuts on running gauge and you can't do anything. Like, I don't
[3876.28s -> 3880.24s]  know if you've ever tried to play Rell gone in and been like, Thresh
[3880.24s -> 3888.72s]  flayed, but it's the worst feeling. It's a bad feeling. It's like when people
[3888.72s -> 3894.80s]  play Leonets the same reason Leonets shit right now. Like they both have the same idea of why they're bad, right?
[3896.16s -> 3900.32s]  They like have they're both good at doing what they're supposed to do. Like, you know,
[3900.32s -> 3903.68s]  stone and create pressure and point click and shit. But the problem is is like,
[3905.68s -> 3910.56s]  you can easily counterpeck them so incredibly hard that they just become worthless the whole game.
[3914.81s -> 3919.13s]  We've ever gotten sent a secondary mission all the time. With Senate being like with
[3919.13s -> 3927.45s]  thrash being meta and set up being like a champion on playing a lot. I get that all the time. You don't even notice it though. I'm gonna be real
[3928.89s -> 3934.01s]  When you kill the thrash or whatever and you get these souls, you don't even fucking notice it because like it's like 40 armor
[3937.93s -> 3940.73s]  And it's like your level 17 or some shit at that point
[3941.77s -> 3947.33s]  Like at the point you're getting it you're such a high level that like the 40 random armor like it's nice
[3947.33s -> 3956.02s]  But I never really notice it
[3956.02s -> 3958.30s]  point to get a teammates ahead isn't that good?
[3958.30s -> 3962.46s]  You don't have actually been doing as support on my main account.
[3962.46s -> 3974.77s]  I've actually been roaming non-stop and it's super OP.
[3974.77s -> 3979.89s]  Because the key to roaming is all you have to do to roam well
[3979.89s -> 3985.05s]  is literally be there one or two times in the first five minutes of the game
[3985.05s -> 3990.13s]  to completely fuck over the enemy one time on an engage or something
[3990.13s -> 3994.41s]  And they get so far behind from it that you can literally just walk back about
[3998.16s -> 4009.08s]  Like I do on senate like I'll push bot lane. This is my strategy and senate. I'm gonna give it to you guys. Okay, so I don't know I don't know if this works in low a low, but in like masters like high masters. This works at least
[4010.64s -> 4019.44s]  This is all I do in senate every single player I play against on senate every single one except for like pike players even not of us, but they they all can see the lane level one
[4020.04s -> 4023.08s]  Every single one of them right they just they just let me push level one
[4023.36s -> 4032.96s]  And so I'll push the waves in level one and I'll either crash wave two or wave three depending on how far they're giving me like push power, right?
[4032.96s -> 4037.92s]  So I will always crash wave two or wave three bot and I will immediately
[4038.92s -> 4039.92s]  Roman
[4040.92s -> 4041.92s]  every time
[4042.92s -> 4043.92s]  and
[4044.56s -> 4046.40s]  even if I don't get a kill
[4046.80s -> 4052.40s]  usually it fucks over the enemy mid laner so badly because on that exact timer
[4052.40s -> 4060.06s]  There's usually a gang happening on men.
[4060.06s -> 4063.56s]  So, a lot of the time people think that you're roaming
[4063.56s -> 4066.22s]  to get a kill for the winner, you're not.
[4066.22s -> 4070.54s]  You're roaming to counter pressure from the other players
[4070.54s -> 4073.57s]  in the game.
[4073.57s -> 4075.01s]  How many times have you guys been like,
[4075.01s -> 4077.93s]  oh, we can win this 2v2, you see the enemy jungler,
[4077.93s -> 4080.13s]  your jungler comes, you're like, oh, we're going to bait this.
[4080.13s -> 4081.65s]  And then all of a sudden the support shows up
[4081.65s -> 4083.33s]  and you're like, God dammit.
[4083.33s -> 4085.81s]  And then you die, and you're like, what the fuck?
[4085.81s -> 4088.77s]  That right there is how easy it is to play support,
[4088.77s -> 4093.77s]  because all you have to do is show up once, twice,
[4093.77s -> 4095.69s]  and now that entire of my aim is fucked
[4095.69s -> 4102.28s]  for the enemy team.
[4102.28s -> 4104.04s]  Rome is so easy.
[4104.04s -> 4106.76s]  The only thing, people fuck up roaming really bad
[4106.76s -> 4109.52s]  when they roam on timers where they're 80 carry
[4109.52s -> 4111.36s]  can't safely farm.
[4111.36s -> 4113.72s]  So what ends up happening is on that timer, right?
[4113.72s -> 4116.32s]  Where I'm like, I told you way of two, three, right?
[4116.32s -> 4119.56s]  What happens is you push that wave in, you roam in.
[4119.56s -> 4121.16s]  Let's say nothing happens, okay?
[4121.16s -> 4123.32s]  I can just walk back a bot.
[4123.32s -> 4125.12s]  It's, you lose nothing.
[4125.12s -> 4126.36s]  And if usually at that point,
[4126.36s -> 4127.84s]  you have like three-and-a-gold,
[4127.84s -> 4129.44s]  so there's no point in backing, right?
[4129.44s -> 4130.60s]  Now, let's say like,
[4130.60s -> 4134.28s]  I noticed that my jungler is like invading topside.
[4134.28s -> 4136.28s]  I just walk over to top and help him.
[4137.56s -> 4142.00s]  Because you have like three to four waves
[4142.00s -> 4143.76s]  before the enemy bot lane,
[4143.76s -> 4150.80s]  the enemy bot lane has to play it almost perfectly
[4150.80s -> 4154.48s]  to be able to abuse your room on certain timers.
[4155.88s -> 4158.80s]  They essentially have to put it perfect to abuse the room.
[4158.80s -> 4160.52s]  What I mean by that is like,
[4160.52s -> 4164.16s]  the best way to abuse a support roaming is you either A.
[4165.16s -> 4166.76s]  If you have the ability to dive,
[4166.76s -> 4168.20s]  you can pretty much A,
[4169.88s -> 4172.08s]  immediately dive, like push the next wave
[4172.08s -> 4173.24s]  and then immediately dive
[4173.24s -> 4174.84s]  if you have that ability to say a point
[4174.84s -> 4176.32s]  when we own a driver or something.
[4176.32s -> 4178.20s]  But even then, it's a little risky
[4178.20s -> 4180.16s]  because then the 80 carry can just walk back
[4180.16s -> 4183.92s]  and then we lose one wave and you gave up a stack chance.
[4183.92s -> 4185.20s]  So it's not that bad.
[4185.20s -> 4188.48s]  Two, you can stack the wave.
[4188.48s -> 4191.68s]  Now, stacking the wave is the best way to counter it.
[4191.68s -> 4194.28s]  Because let's say I'm roaming for an extended period.
[4194.28s -> 4196.00s]  You stack like a three wave,
[4196.00s -> 4197.44s]  and then all of a sudden you're crashing it.
[4197.44s -> 4199.12s]  And then you want up a level
[4199.12s -> 4200.40s]  because you've been gaining XP
[4200.40s -> 4202.24s]  and the 80 carry has to back off.
[4202.24s -> 4205.72s]  But the way to counter that is you simply just walk back
[4205.72s -> 4207.76s]  on the timer of the stacked wave crashing
[4207.76s -> 4209.68s]  as an 80 carry, or as a support.
[4209.68s -> 4211.68s]  It's so incredibly easy to do.
[4211.68s -> 4214.52s]  It's actually brainlessly easy to do.
[4214.52s -> 4218.44s]  Like, it's literally, you can roam all you want,
[4218.44s -> 4221.16s]  bot lane, as long as you are in bot lane
[4221.16s -> 4224.04s]  for the stacked wave crashes or you are in bot lane
[4224.04s -> 4230.87s]  when your jungler is bot side of the map.
[4230.87s -> 4234.09s]  It's easiest fuck.
[4234.09s -> 4236.97s]  But support players, drooling themselves.
[4236.97s -> 4238.89s]  So they like to essentially
[4240.21s -> 4243.49s]  support players like to like AFK in the lane phase.
[4243.49s -> 4245.33s]  They like to literally sit there
[4245.33s -> 4246.33s]  and just do nothing.
[4248.17s -> 4251.97s]  That's like the average support I see is they will stand and do nothing.
[4254.84s -> 4259.40s]  And and I've said this before, but I'll say it again, being a good support is not being a better player than enemy team.
[4259.80s -> 4262.40s]  Being a good support is queuing up to play League of Legends.
[4264.04s -> 4269.32s]  That's that's all it takes. All it takes to be a good support is queuing up with the intent to push buttons in the game.
[4270.60s -> 4271.48s]  And not just AFK.
[4498.64s -> 4500.04s]  All right, I'm back.
[4500.04s -> 4502.04s]  What's up?
[4502.04s -> 4511.51s]  I don't remember we're talking about all supports yeah they're all stupid.
[4511.51s -> 4515.91s]  Don't af can't support you'll gain LP it's that it's actually that easy.
[4515.91s -> 4532.99s]  I want to say I don't think supports a stupid I think it's more of a how do I phrase this
[4532.99s -> 4539.56s]  it's in my opinion it's more of like they're like they've never they don't have to
[4539.56s -> 4545.39s]  learn.
[4545.39s -> 4550.23s]  Support players like don't have to learn important things because they can get away with
[4550.23s -> 4562.63s]  Not doing it, so they develop bad habits that's oldest.
[4562.63s -> 4564.63s]  Do I have a Spotify playlist?
[4564.63s -> 4569.60s]  Yeah.
[4569.60s -> 4571.76s]  Best role to climb.
[4571.76s -> 4573.76s]  I think every role is good to climb.
[4573.76s -> 4575.20s]  As long as you're good.
[4575.20s -> 4576.48s]  Classic Jarrett, oh I don't see.
[4577.52s -> 4579.52s]  Whatever you linked, I don't know about links in the chat
[4579.52s -> 4581.36s]  because I had to turn them off a long time ago.
[4582.88s -> 4590.18s]  So I can't see this.
[4590.18s -> 4592.90s]  I would say climbing is just about like whatever,
[4592.90s -> 4595.86s]  because every role you can climb on, right? Like every single role.
[4595.86s -> 4607.44s]  So climbing a lot of the time is just about what you think is most fun for you and you can get the best at.
[4607.44s -> 4617.44s]  I would say objectively, the best roles to climb on are jungle and support for just like higher e-vote.
[4617.44s -> 4621.44s]  Well, jungle and lower e-vote support and higher e-vote.
[4621.44s -> 4629.44s]  I wouldn't climb on support in like gold because you're not going to have a good time trying to like help bad players play the game.
[4629.44s -> 4636.00s]  Bad, it's mean people who don't like you can get it like a gold as real 30 kills by being the better support
[4636.24s -> 4645.12s]  But you won't always win whereas like if you really want to control solo queue and your teammates aren't like good enough to carry at that level by themselves
[4645.12s -> 4650.88s]  Right, like you get frustrated just pick something that has more agency in the game
[4658.92s -> 4665.20s]  You lost 18 or 24 as jungle you want to turn you roll. I mean you could play it. He it's if you think it's it
[4665.20s -> 4679.40s]  it carries interesting. I wouldn't say it's like fun, but it's not, it's not bad. You're in gold.
[4679.40s -> 4684.52s]  I mean, you could try it. My view on it is if people were wondering if they want to play a role or not,
[4685.16s -> 4688.12s]  my view is just try it. See if you like it because if you don't like the role,
[4688.12s -> 4691.08s]  you're not going to be able to put in enough games to get good at the role, right? So like,
[4692.28s -> 4696.60s]  just give it a try. See if you enjoy it or not. And if it's not fun, then if it's not your
[4696.60s -> 4701.88s]  Playstyle, it's not fun because 80s are very unique playstyle from all the other rules.
[4701.88s -> 4709.48s]  Like, the reason people don't like playing 80 carry and like watching 80 carry streamers
[4709.48s -> 4720.23s]  in ship is because 80 carry is like, it's boring, 80 carry is like zero, like, like,
[4720.23s -> 4723.55s]  there was a graph of shit going on when you're playing 80 carry in the game, it's like
[4723.55s -> 4724.55s]  this.
[4724.55s -> 4728.67s]  There's like spikes to 100 and then it's back to like this, right?
[4728.67s -> 4737.00s]  It's like, Eddie Carrey is a lot of every game is different, right?
[4737.00s -> 4743.80s]  Every game when you play 80s different, because you're always with a different player,
[4743.80s -> 4745.76s]  like a different support unless you do okay.
[4745.76s -> 4751.48s]  So every Eddie Carrey's game's difference, coupled with, you spend a lot of the game
[4751.48s -> 4755.12s]  just farming, but you don't get to interact with the enemy a lot.
[4755.12s -> 4760.64s]  So you just kind of farm a lot of the game and even then, you also like, you've
[4760.64s -> 4765.64s]  Basically, they're farming for like little dopamine hits of like team fights and stuff that you get around the game, so that's kind of fun.
[4765.64s -> 4771.36s]  But it's, like I said, it's all you. You can climb on any roll.
[4771.36s -> 4781.36s]  I think 80 carry requires the most mechanical skill to climb because the difference between the climbing is like a jungler is about being in the right spot at the right time, right?
[4781.36s -> 4784.36s]  Like you need to path this way, get objectives, et cetera.
[4784.36s -> 4789.36s]  Climbing is an 80 carry is more about like this person fucked up their positioning. I'm gonna kill them.
[4789.36s -> 4823.44s]  option. We're constantly queue. Also, I want to say something. If you are playing
[4823.44s -> 4829.68s]  make sure, and this is just a really good standardized bit of advice, make sure you're
[4829.68s -> 4836.72s]  always tracking what the enemy cooldowns are, what their spells are, stuff like that's.
[4836.72s -> 4841.32s]  Okay? Because playing the game is not just about like farming and, you know, like your team
[4841.32s -> 4844.66s]  goes in and you auto and shits, like right now, mid to me, alright? I can see that
[4844.66s -> 4849.30s]  But it is a verus, so I'm not too worried about being like a little too divided verus
[4850.10s -> 4853.70s]  Not that much right, so I can kind of play backward because I know that
[4854.90s -> 4859.06s]  It's a high chance he's not gonna run bottom up with two as a verus now that was like a phase or some shit
[4859.06s -> 4860.58s]  I immediately back up
[4860.58s -> 4865.18s]  So we noticed that it's pretty obvious Recon probably got w level two. We don't know what it is
[4865.38s -> 4868.66s]  But he has Q so he doesn't have shield which means
[4871.97s -> 4876.11s]  Because he doesn't have shield
[4876.11s -> 4879.55s]  It's hard for the reclond to get back out if he fucks up an engage
[4880.43s -> 4885.63s]  So you need to think about these type of things, right now. This is way four I believe and because it's way four
[4886.27s -> 4891.27s]  We're gonna get level three on way four you always get level three on way four if you have full XP
[4893.87s -> 4895.87s]  You get level two on wave two and
[4896.95s -> 4901.67s]  You get level three on way four and these timers for when you get
[4902.79s -> 4909.00s]  Certain webwops, bollin are very important now. I'm gonna hover over here
[4909.76s -> 4911.76s]  Uh, you see how fiddle is right here?
[4913.12s -> 4915.68s]  I'm actually gonna just walk in here and see if I can like
[4917.08s -> 4919.08s]  Yeah, we see him. Nice
[4919.36s -> 4924.12s]  See this is exactly what I was talking about before. Do you see what my support is doing?
[4924.84s -> 4926.84s]  I I left the lane
[4927.92s -> 4934.52s]  Guys, I walked to like stand next to my jungler after we push the wave in my lulu is
[4935.60s -> 4937.60s]  hanging out by herself
[4937.60s -> 4958.77s]  self-botland, but you should just chill in.
[4958.77s -> 4960.89s]  You don't want to do that.
[4960.89s -> 4962.53s]  You don't want to ever want to be the guy
[4962.53s -> 4966.93s]  who's like buy yourself botland as a support.
[4966.93s -> 4970.53s]  Because you don't, like, support's don't need gold, right?
[4970.53s -> 4972.05s]  Not really.
[4972.05s -> 4973.13s]  And you don't need farm.
[4973.13s -> 4974.13s]  You don't need all that shit.
[4974.13s -> 4976.89s]  So if you're 80 carry rooms and unless the wave is fucked
[4976.89s -> 4977.73s]  and they're just being stupid,
[4977.73s -> 4979.41s]  and you have to fix the wave or something,
[4979.41s -> 4981.73s]  you don't want to be buy yourself in the win.
[4981.73s -> 4985.85s]  It just doesn't do anything.
[4985.85s -> 4987.01s]  How do I know auto tower?
[4987.01s -> 4990.57s]  Oh, I used to tell that.
[4990.57s -> 4992.81s]  So there's a way, there's actually a setting
[4992.81s -> 4995.77s]  you can have in the game, where when you hit a button
[4995.77s -> 4998.53s]  and makes it so that I can't physically hit anything
[4998.53s -> 4999.85s]  but a champion.
[4999.85s -> 5003.61s]  It's target, it's called target champions only.
[5003.61s -> 5005.57s]  And it's basically like here, I'll do it for you right now, watch.
[5005.57s -> 5007.37s]  You see how I can hit the tower?
[5007.37s -> 5010.37s]  You see how it's the red sword?
[5010.37s -> 5011.53s]  Look.
[5011.53s -> 5013.05s]  So when I hit this button,
[5013.05s -> 5015.21s]  I can no longer hit the tower or the minions.
[5016.33s -> 5018.25s]  But I can still hit the champions.
[5020.01s -> 5023.09s]  So essentially, when you're fighting at a big minion wave
[5023.09s -> 5024.69s]  or you're fighting under turret,
[5024.69s -> 5025.85s]  you don't want to miss click,
[5027.25s -> 5029.89s]  you just hit target champions only button.
[5029.89s -> 5032.01s]  And it makes it a thousand times easier
[5032.01s -> 5036.60s]  because you can literally only hit the champion.
[5036.60s -> 5047.81s]  It's really nice.
[5047.81s -> 5049.69s]  And you can make the button anything you want, obviously.
[5049.69s -> 5057.66s]  I just, I use Tilda, that's the default.
[5057.66s -> 5059.66s]  I actually wanna tell these guys,
[5059.66s -> 5061.94s]  But I need to wait for the way to push out just a pair.
[5063.06s -> 5064.98s]  The jungler could be bought, but it is a fetal stick.
[5064.98s -> 5067.42s]  So it's like, I don't really care about a fetal stick being bought.
[5067.42s -> 5081.57s]  We can straight up just kill them.
[5081.57s -> 5087.18s]  Okay, well apparently we can't kill them.
[5087.18s -> 5090.22s]  Because apparently my rule, we didn't want to walk up.
[5091.34s -> 5093.22s]  That's so frustrating, man.
[5093.22s -> 5098.06s]  I did fuck up my auto there, but I am a little,
[5098.06s -> 5100.66s]  I am kind of curious what happens.
[5100.66s -> 5101.62s]  I don't have to go watch the Vod.
[5101.62s -> 5102.98s]  I fucked up my kill in the Ziya.
[5102.98s -> 5104.78s]  I think I walked to left and stood there,
[5104.78s -> 5107.06s]  that my movement was bad.
[5107.06s -> 5108.82s]  Like, essentially, when they fight, right?
[5108.82s -> 5112.02s]  I walked like this, I should have walked like this
[5112.02s -> 5115.06s]  because you wanna cut off the Ziya from the gang.
[5115.06s -> 5118.14s]  Now, I do think, when we just blindly ran away,
[5118.14s -> 5119.86s]  I think she kind of grieved,
[5119.86s -> 5121.54s]  you don't need to insta run from gang,
[5121.54s -> 5123.14s]  especially when you could see what I have,
[5123.14s -> 5124.50s]  like I have Durk and Sheen.
[5125.66s -> 5127.66s]  Something that a lot of people do as well
[5127.66s -> 5130.10s]  is they will see that like the numbers are uneven
[5130.10s -> 5131.34s]  and they'll instantly run away.
[5131.34s -> 5134.10s]  They don't think about like how to win the fight or like what the the win
[5134.10s -> 5136.98s]  Conn is of the fight because that's why I was saying before we got gang
[5136.98s -> 5141.06s]  It was like fiddle can't can't can't can't can't and he can't pre-sex fiddle does nothing in the gang
[5141.06s -> 5143.06s]  I had cleanse
[5143.06s -> 5145.30s]  They don't actually beat us in 3v2
[5145.50s -> 5151.14s]  So the problem was is we weren't focusing the same target. I went for the Ziya and she backed really far up
[5151.66s -> 5156.26s]  Now if we had played forward a bit like say she played a little more forward with me
[5156.42s -> 5158.98s]  That would have gone a lot better or if I had played a little more back with her
[5158.98s -> 5166.38s]  It was basically like we don't have comms so the you know I got rough now. Fiddlesticks now
[5166.72s -> 5168.72s]  So it's a little scary
[5168.72s -> 5169.72s]  I
[5169.72s -> 5173.40s]  Don't like playing versus fiddle sticks for like the reason of like 90% of the time
[5174.40s -> 5178.16s]  Players don't know how to ward around fiddle people put words and weird spots
[5178.76s -> 5183.07s]  We should have won that fight though. I'm a little salty
[5183.67s -> 5194.66s]  Mainly myself so this too. We will keep speeding me up
[5194.66s -> 5204.51s]  I want to be honest with you. I don't like when we lose do that. It's like a pet pee
[5204.51s -> 5209.63s]  thing in mind when we lose use their speed. I'm okay with it if I need to dog something
[5209.63s -> 5213.43s]  or I need to chase somebody, but I think it's just so much less value than using it to
[5213.43s -> 5220.43s]  CC. Early game. Early game, the CC of we will like using W is so broken to me because
[5220.43s -> 5232.26s]  they just physically can't move their character for like 1.5 seconds, which is crazy. I think
[5232.26s -> 5241.40s]  fiddles bot. You can kind of tell. You see how they're playing really aggressive. They
[5241.40s -> 5247.56s]  don't beat us to v2. So I'm thinking and they just cleared this word out. I'm thinking
[5247.56s -> 5254.38s]  fiddles either on dragon or he's bush ganking bot somewhere. So I don't really want to walk
[5254.38s -> 5261.88s]  up. You see how this guy is confidently hitting the turret? This is making me think fiddles trying
[5261.88s -> 5274.16s]  to Wayne Gang. Because they cannot beat us to V2. I think Fiddles in here. So I'm actually
[5274.16s -> 5280.20s]  just going to play today. Until we see him on the map, I don't know. I'm not going to
[5280.20s -> 5294.49s]  take the chance. Because you got to think about what you see and what you don't see on
[5294.49s -> 5298.61s]  the map. We can't physically see Fiddles, right? But think about this. We don't see him
[5298.61s -> 5303.53s]  top. That's something you have to think about. We had a ward on Rift just now for 15
[5303.53s -> 5305.53s]  15 seconds, right?
[5305.53s -> 5307.53s]  We didn't see him top.
[5307.53s -> 5310.53s]  So like if he's not top, where is he?
[5310.53s -> 5314.74s]  Now I think he finally left.
[5314.74s -> 5320.65s]  This looks like he went to Dragon.
[5320.65s -> 5330.32s]  Yeah.
[5330.32s -> 5332.32s]  What are we doing, by the way?
[5332.32s -> 5334.32s]  I mean, I guess I'm just going to die.
[5334.32s -> 5337.82s]  Now would be the time to speed me.
[5337.82s -> 5340.82s]  I mean, I don't even know what to say about that.
[5340.82s -> 5342.82s]  Malzahar just didn't walk.
[5342.82s -> 5348.74s]  Gregus didn't flash his E.
[5348.74s -> 5350.74s]  Malzahar didn't walk.
[5350.74s -> 5355.90s]  you always walk there by the way I want to make this clear if you're a middle
[5355.90s -> 5360.66s]  inner and you're playing a late game scaling mid you always walk to the
[5360.66s -> 5365.86s]  fight no matter what though if it's at if it's going if it's doing that okay
[5365.86s -> 5375.10s]  guys we need to walk to fights and we need to follow up when I go in don't
[5375.10s -> 5382.61s]  run I'm just gonna type it because I'm actually fucking annoying my little
[5382.61s -> 5389.81s]  frustrated. I still think the game is 100% one of old, but I'm playing Draven. We're playing like I'm playing fucking Ezreal or some shit
[5390.53s -> 5395.41s]  And I can't walk up because essentially it we know Fiddle was bought for the last two three minutes, right?
[5395.41s -> 5412.06s]  He just sat down there. What is my loop loop doing bro? What are you doing? No, we fight this go
[5413.34s -> 5422.11s]  Yeah, this guy doesn't get to do this for free now. They have a gale force, so I need to be a little care
[5422.11s -> 5425.11s]  This guy has no ulti though.
[5425.11s -> 5431.58s]  But this is what I'm losing my mind, man.
[5431.58s -> 5434.58s]  I do, just follow.
[5434.58s -> 5443.32s]  No, what she was doing, what she was trying to protect her ward.
[5443.32s -> 5449.32s]  She saw the recon hitting the ward, but the Ziya walked up to get a free to just die.
[5449.32s -> 5458.64s]  The problem is, my lubeu was like, oh, I don't want to give up my ward, and she wasn't thinking.
[5458.64s -> 5461.64s]  Please, just sit with me.
[5461.64s -> 5468.64s]  Okay, yeah, sorry, I need you to follow me always.
[5469.88s -> 5474.88s]  Even if it looks scary, you gotta follow, okay?
[5474.88s -> 5489.23s]  Also, one thing is there's actually not a lot of fighting that happens in lower ego.
[5489.23s -> 5497.23s]  So a lot of these players don't know how to fight early because one thing that I think has gotten really bad about me lately,
[5497.23s -> 5502.19s]  Just in the past few years is people don't ever limit test and league ever anymore
[5502.59s -> 5507.87s]  They always just play like Pussies every single player in league plays like a fucking pussy not as
[5508.75s -> 5521.36s]  And it's it's literally just like sad to see like right there. Why aren't we wing?
[5521.98s -> 5535.05s]  Use w on the Ziya not to speed like I'm losing my mind because all you have to do there is w the Ziya
[5535.05s -> 5535.89s]  I actually get CCed.
[5535.89s -> 5536.85s]  We kill her on the W.
[5538.33s -> 5540.37s]  I'm telling you, blue blue players are like hard,
[5540.37s -> 5545.37s]  wired for some reason to not play correctly.
[5562.14s -> 5563.14s]  I'm never gonna catch this guy.
[5563.14s -> 5570.93s]  He's got Gail forcing to your two boots.
[5570.93s -> 5572.57s]  Yeah, I mean, I have to go forward though
[5572.57s -> 5574.97s]  because if I don't go for Gail, it's now the games over.
[5574.97s -> 5576.61s]  So I'd see there we go for it, I mean, lose.
[5576.61s -> 5582.12s]  So I'm willing to like look stupid.
[5582.12s -> 5585.16s]  Honestly, this game was my fault for the one to be three
[5585.16s -> 5586.00s]  that happened early.
[5586.00s -> 5587.16s]  I misplied it.
[5587.16s -> 5588.36s]  And if I didn't misplied that,
[5588.36s -> 5590.64s]  we would have won the game off it.
[5590.64s -> 5592.12s]  Now the game's pretty much over.
[5592.12s -> 5593.36s]  I don't know.
[5593.36s -> 5595.48s]  Like, it's so okay so we can always come back.
[5595.48s -> 5599.28s]  But the problem is, I don't think we have good enough
[5599.28s -> 5600.68s]  players to come back.
[5600.68s -> 5601.84s]  Like look at what Lou was doing.
[5601.84s -> 5606.28s]  Lou, why are you bought so low at the moment?
[5606.28s -> 5610.27s]  Think, like what?
[5610.27s -> 5622.06s]  It's, ah, ah, what are we doing?
[5622.06s -> 5624.02s]  This is exactly what I was telling you guys,
[5624.02s -> 5625.70s]  it doesn't make sense.
[5625.70s -> 5630.14s]  Remember when I told you supports easy, all you have to do is be a human.
[5630.14s -> 5636.28s]  Remember when I said that 40 sec or four minutes ago before the game started?
[5636.28s -> 5640.56s]  All you have to do to play support is think, push buttons, and be active in the game.
[5640.56s -> 5646.79s]  And if you can do those things, you'll get chavinger on support.
[5646.79s -> 5649.11s]  Like it blows my mind.
[5649.11s -> 5671.69s]  Like look at what you're doing!
[5671.69s -> 5672.69s]  This is a forfe, though.
[5672.69s -> 5676.55s]  I'm gonna lose my mind.
[5676.55s -> 5677.91s]  Auto filled AD.
[5677.91s -> 5691.58s]  I'm gonna lose it.
[5691.58s -> 5692.58s]  My bad, yes.
[5692.58s -> 5705.94s]  I'm just bad. It's on me. I apologize. Oh, yeah, these players are crazy
[5706.44s -> 5712.01s]  I'm actually really surprised where it's not forfeiting now
[5715.20s -> 5720.32s]  The best way to play the game is something that like I fall victim to too, right fuck this up sometimes, right
[5720.68s -> 5722.68s]  But the best way to play the game a lot of the time is
[5723.32s -> 5726.04s]  You essentially don't play to take risks
[5727.80s -> 5732.24s]  I know it sounds silly because you you gotta find essentially you have to find the
[5732.24s -> 5747.34s]  Um, my mouth is a hard, just let this guy, this 1000 gold walk away. Hey, mouse, if you moved by the way, you get one
[5747.34s -> 5776.74s]  K gold. Mid isn't hard roll. I can mid in my sleep. It's not. It is easiest roll. I'm 80
[5776.74s -> 5792.00s]  carry streamer. I play AD, but Lulu is small brain. That was mean. Lulu took some cross
[5792.00s -> 5816.26s]  fire there that she didn't need to take. That was my bad. That was toxic. I'll be real.
[5816.26s -> 5821.30s]  I think today is going to be a mute all kind of day. Listening to low elo players talk
[5821.30s -> 5825.14s]  about the game and then they think that they're right about the game and like how it works
[5825.14s -> 5829.70s]  and all the shits. It actually like hurts me. Like it shouldn't. I should just laugh it off,
[5829.70s -> 5835.54s]  But sometimes when I see a low-Evo player talk about how they think the game should be played and I just know that they're wrong
[5836.06s -> 5843.41s]  It actually like physically hurts me. It does it physically hurts
[5853.38s -> 5859.98s]  But I should follow my own rule where if you're playing with people that aren't as good like they don't see what you see
[5860.66s -> 5865.58s]  Right there's like something where it's better to play safe in scale even on driving
[5865.86s -> 5869.30s]  It's better to play safe in scale than to go for plays in lane
[5871.86s -> 5881.06s]  Mainly because if you go for plays in lane and let's say your support is not as good as you
[5881.06s -> 5885.86s]  or your support is not confident in their ability to 2v2 right then you're just going to lose.
[5885.86s -> 5889.86s]  So you're like forcing that person to be in an uncomfortable situation.
[5889.86s -> 5896.86s]  So it's hard for me as a player to just play safe when I see the enemy making mistake after mistake.
[5896.86s -> 5902.18s]  It's like something that I have trouble like personally working on right just like a personal issue
[5902.50s -> 5907.06s]  Where like I'll see an enemy make a mistake positional wise and I'm like, oh shit. Let's abuse this
[5907.30s -> 5909.30s]  But a lot of the time the problem that happens is
[5910.42s -> 5914.66s]  You have somebody who doesn't know that that person made a mistake or doesn't see the same mistake as me
[5914.66s -> 5916.18s]  And because there's no comms
[5916.18s -> 5920.98s]  I can't relate to them that we should fight right so if I go in and they don't know that we should be fighting there
[5920.98s -> 5928.52s]  I end up dying and it looks it feels really bad which is I mean
[5928.94s -> 5934.44s]  My fault. It's like a personal thing because you can't control your supports. You can only control yourself.
[5934.44s -> 5937.94s]  It's just something that like I suck at doing sometimes.
[5937.94s -> 5964.14s]  Right? So that's just on man.
[5964.14s -> 5968.14s]  We could actually kill the Zyron, by the way. She's like 60% HP.
[5968.14s -> 5998.41s]  Like we could kill her. What is my braggess doing? Oh, he got her though, nice.
[5998.41s -> 6009.20s]  Bro, use W. Just you see people.
[6009.20s -> 6012.20s]  Not to speed people.
[6012.20s -> 6020.48s]  That was a good example, too. Oh well.
[6020.48s -> 6028.46s]  I just got to get better doing that where I play safe though.
[6028.46s -> 6030.46s]  That's on me. That's just a personal thing.
[6030.46s -> 6032.46s]  I got to get better out. Oh man.
[6032.46s -> 6061.38s]  I think we're warmed up though.
[6061.38s -> 6063.38s]  What 80 carried you guys want to see next game?
[6063.38s -> 6066.38s]  That was, that was a brutal ask game.
[6066.38s -> 6070.38s]  I'm gonna be real. That was a brutal ask game.
[6070.38s -> 6078.38s]  What 80 carry streamer do you guys want to say or 80 kick stream? What 80 carry champion? Do you guys want to see this game?
[6078.38s -> 6087.80s]  I just goofed up and tried to play to aggressive with the player that wasn't going to play aggressive. That was on me.
[6087.80s -> 6111.57s]  That's my bad. I'll play better. Sky, this guy goes sion.
[6111.57s -> 6126.06s]  Never change to a chat, never change.
[6126.06s -> 6143.23s]  Well, the thing is, you have to change my mindset.
[6143.23s -> 6145.23s]  So like the thing, okay, let me explain something
[6145.23s -> 6147.23s]  that's like a personal thing with me.
[6147.23s -> 6150.23s]  I'm very, very, very good mechanically at this game, right?
[6150.23s -> 6153.23s]  It's my best trade is like I have very good mechanics.
[6153.23s -> 6156.23s]  So, and I also have like an autistic weird brain
[6156.23s -> 6162.23s]  where I can see, I have really a pattern recognition.
[6162.23s -> 6168.59s]  So when I see that the enemy is fcking up, I know that I'm pretty much always going to be better at the 2v2.
[6169.47s -> 6178.47s]  Okay. So because I know that I'm always going to be better at the 2v2, I always want to take the fight.
[6179.87s -> 6185.67s]  When I see that they make a mistake like they miss a skill shot or they walk up too far stuff like that, right?
[6185.67s -> 6192.17s]  But the problem is when you're balling, you have to work with a teammate and that's part of just playing 80 carry, right?
[6192.17s -> 6204.67s]  And if you're in so much, you can't always do it. So you have to, I have to like train myself to just be okay with them making mistakes and us not abusing those mistakes.
[6204.67s -> 6210.67s]  It's very frustrating for me personally because I'm a perfectionist. So it's very frustrating for me to like see this happening and I'm like,
[6210.67s -> 6217.67s]  Oh, I want to abuse this because I know we can, but we have to like I have to like tell myself not to and to just like not fuck up the waves
[6217.67s -> 6221.67s]  They not take bad trades and shit because every there's there's more to it too
[6221.67s -> 6226.87s]  So if like I walk up and I take a fight, right? Let's say like when we're con w didn't when the fiddle game for example, right?
[6227.67s -> 6236.67s]  Uh, if I take that fight, I'm now banking that fight on Lulu also playing correctly, right? Like they they missed all their abilities and they fucked up
[6236.67s -> 6244.67s]  up, but I also messed like, you, nobody can play perfectly every game. Like I can't
[6244.67s -> 6247.95s]  teammates can't, nobody can't. It's legal. We're all humans, right? So you have to
[6247.95s -> 6251.87s]  bank when you're doing that on like your teammate being able to know what you want to
[6251.87s -> 6256.75s]  accomplish in that moment. And so I'll cue with no comms and it's really hard. Like it's
[6256.75s -> 6263.71s]  a really bad mindset that I have sometimes. But it's hard to get over because like I like
[6263.71s -> 6269.17s]  like the waning phase for me is the most fun part of the game.
[6269.17s -> 6270.65s]  I have what waning phase,
[6270.65s -> 6271.65s]  because in my opinion,
[6271.65s -> 6273.37s]  waning phase is like a little mini chess game
[6273.37s -> 6274.81s]  between the enemy, Bob, and, right?
[6275.93s -> 6278.97s]  It's like a chess game with like mechanics.
[6278.97s -> 6283.17s]  Where it's like, how well can I auto-space them, right?
[6283.17s -> 6284.89s]  Can I space them well?
[6284.89s -> 6287.13s]  Can I space them like, can I, by spacing?
[6287.13s -> 6288.29s]  I mean, can I walk into them?
[6288.29s -> 6291.01s]  Trade and not take damage back, right?
[6291.01s -> 6292.13s]  And I'm always thinking to myself, okay,
[6292.13s -> 6292.97s]  can I do that?
[6292.97s -> 6293.81s]  I can.
[6293.81s -> 6295.37s]  And I'm like, I wanna do this, right?
[6295.37s -> 6299.45s]  and then I'll get somebody to half and then they'll panic and they'll engage on me.
[6299.45s -> 6304.65s]  And the problem is though, is like I said, without comms or without like people who are
[6304.65s -> 6311.85s]  recognizing what you're trying to accomplish, sometimes supports and junglers, people get flustered
[6311.85s -> 6315.93s]  and it will go badly. And it's my fault at the end of the day because I'm choosing to
[6315.93s -> 6321.37s]  that play style of relying on my teammates instead of like knowing that I can probably outscale
[6321.37s -> 6326.89s]  and play better away game and just like keep good CS and not die on shit, which is what you guys should all do.
[6327.93s -> 6331.53s]  And that's what I tell people to do when they ask me how to play a game. I tell you like,
[6331.53s -> 6336.97s]  don't die, scale up, get items. But like because I've played the game for so long and my favorite
[6336.97s -> 6343.21s]  part of the game is land phase and like winning land and playing that little chess game,
[6343.21s -> 6349.21s]  I fucked myself over in a lot of games because I'll like, you know, force fights that like my
[6349.21s -> 6352.09s]  My teammate would have to play well in as well to win.
[6352.09s -> 6354.33s]  And I'll make a mistake or I'll make a mistake
[6354.33s -> 6355.93s]  and we'll just lose the game off it.
[6355.93s -> 6358.41s]  And it's not a good playstyle.
[6359.97s -> 6361.33s]  Right, it's not a good playstyle.
[6362.57s -> 6364.21s]  That's just like something that like,
[6364.21s -> 6367.29s]  I know other people probably also have.
[6367.29s -> 6368.97s]  And I'm telling you that like, if you wanna climb,
[6368.97s -> 6370.53s]  you gotta get out of that mindset
[6370.53s -> 6376.51s]  and get into the mindset of like, consistency.
[6376.51s -> 6378.99s]  Cause you can see last game, for example,
[6378.99s -> 6388.99s]  I just straight up, like, lost the game off of me, trying to fight when my support didn't know how to fight or want to fight, and we lost the game off it.
[6392.01s -> 6397.01s]  Like, I was too aggro, and even though if they did play correctly, we win, they didn't, so we lost.
[6397.01s -> 6404.01s]  So it's basically like, it's just not like a good, uh, it's not a good, uh, what's the word I'm looking for?
[6404.01s -> 6417.38s]  strategy because last game was my fault because I'm good enough at the game that I
[6417.38s -> 6421.42s]  know that I can't play like that if I want to be consistent and I still point
[6421.42s -> 6429.46s]  like it so it's my ban. I want to replay in this game boys we got Rengar,
[6429.46s -> 6434.10s]  Karma, Jin. What if people want to see? Let me see if any of the 80 characters
[6434.10s -> 6439.54s]  people want to see if I can play these. I can't play vain into this. The vein would
[6439.54s -> 6451.40s]  be way too hard in the Karma, Jin. I would just get so enough to wave. I can play
[6451.40s -> 6455.40s]  This is actually a good of failures game.
[6455.40s -> 6461.08s]  You know what kind of sucks?
[6461.08s -> 6462.08s]  I feel kind of bad playing a
[6462.08s -> 6465.08s]  failures when I'm on my teaching accounts.
[6465.08s -> 6467.08s]  Like this account to like teach you guys.
[6467.08s -> 6470.08s]  I feel bad playing a failure sometimes.
[6470.08s -> 6473.08s]  Because I know a lot of people don't
[6473.08s -> 6475.08s]  want to learn a failure or play a
[6475.08s -> 6478.08s]  failures because he is like really.
[6478.08s -> 6481.08s]  He's very unique.
[6481.08s -> 6489.16s]  a unique. He's hard to learn for a lot of people. I always feel kind of bad doing it.
[6491.16s -> 6495.48s]  But I'll be real. I don't know in this specific situation outside of like jinx.
[6497.24s -> 6499.24s]  I didn't really know what else to pick.
[6500.12s -> 6504.44s]  Like jinx is good. Kaisas probably okay, but you still get zoned off the way of unkaisa.
[6511.94s -> 6513.46s]  Because like if we if we look at this, right?
[6513.46s -> 6521.97s]  I guess okay, but when you're picking a champion for bot lane, right?
[6521.97s -> 6528.97s]  When you're picking a champion for bot lane, one thing that you guys should think about when picking what you know what champion you want to play.
[6528.97s -> 6536.97s]  Unless you're a one trick and then play whatever you want, but if you're like somebody who wants to actually like play the meta and learn why champions are meta and when to pick what?
[6536.97s -> 6545.62s]  They picked Jin Karma. Now we have a Lulu. If we had something with a hook,
[6545.62s -> 6550.78s]  something with a hook, like a not-a-less, a blitz, a thrash, a pike, like if we had
[6550.78s -> 6555.38s]  something like that, I could pick a low range fighter, right? Like I could pick a low
[6555.38s -> 6559.74s]  range fighter if we had a hook champ. But because we don't have a hook champ and we
[6559.74s -> 6565.18s]  have an a chance or I have to pick something that can safely consistently farm and
[6565.18s -> 6569.66s]  not get zoned off by their bow in. So there's not a lot of options that can do
[6569.66s -> 6574.14s]  that. There's like, I didn't want to pick, you could pick Ezreal here. It's not the
[6574.14s -> 6576.58s]  worst, but we had a loop loop, so I didn't want to pick Ezreal, because we
[6576.58s -> 6580.14s]  lose goes the waste. So it's like you could pick Jinx, but I kind of didn't want to
[6580.14s -> 6585.30s]  pick Jinx this game, because Jinx borne the shit out of me right now. So this would
[6585.30s -> 6587.70s]  be a good Jinx game though, if you guys are curious, like this would be a
[6587.70s -> 6595.14s]  completely fine Jinx game. Your E stops Rangar jump. You can follow up really easily
[6595.14s -> 6601.30s]  with Lulu, like this would be a good Jinx game. But a failure, it's a good
[6601.30s -> 6604.30s]  It's both. It's gonna fill his game. Good jinks game.
[6604.30s -> 6606.30s]  It could be a good Xary game.
[6606.30s -> 6610.30s]  Xary wouldn't be that bad here with Luro and against their comp.
[6610.30s -> 6613.30s]  They're all really squishy. She's really mobile.
[6613.30s -> 6615.30s]  Can get away from like ring our ganks pretty easily.
[6615.30s -> 6619.30s]  Tristana. Okay, so Trist is unique because
[6619.30s -> 6623.30s]  You only picked Tristana if you plan on winning land.
[6623.30s -> 6629.30s]  Okay. Tristana doesn't actually scale better than jinks in any way.
[6629.30s -> 6636.26s]  jinx in any way. Like she does not have a better scaling than jinx. Trist versus jinx
[6636.26s -> 6641.86s]  three items. Jinx wins every time and team fights no matter what. Like you, she just
[6641.86s -> 6647.46s]  does what Trist does better. Now the reason you pick Trist is because you do want to win
[6647.46s -> 6650.82s]  lane, you want to like jump in, you want to kill them, you want to be aggressive, right?
[6650.82s -> 6655.38s]  So that's what you're picking Trist for. So I get kills in lane. The problem is, is again,
[6655.38s -> 6658.90s]  what we were just talking about, right? Let's say I pick Trist to get kills in lane.
[6658.90s -> 6664.58s]  Now, let's say my support doesn't want to be aggressive, and let's say like the Jane in the
[6664.58s -> 6670.82s]  karma have a really good push. Okay? Something that Trist is really weak at is being pushed in,
[6670.82s -> 6674.82s]  right? That's one of the weakest things, but she has, she struggles especially early game.
[6674.82s -> 6681.78s]  She struggles quite a bit on farming under turn. So let's say, it's just like a coin
[6681.78s -> 6688.50s]  flippy pick. You could pick Trist if you add like a support duo for sure. Indigent. Trist
[6688.50s -> 6693.62s]  is amazing. Indigent. It's one of Jen's hardest actual counters. But again, it's not about
[6693.62s -> 6697.22s]  countering the champion. It's about countering the lane and what the lane is going to do to you
[6697.22s -> 6702.98s]  and being able to play around that. And this lane is a shove lane. Jen Karma doesn't fight you.
[6702.98s -> 6707.14s]  They poke you and shove waves in. That's what they do. They're a prior win. So they're just
[6707.14s -> 6711.30s]  gonna shove and shove and shove, right? So because they're just gonna shove and shove and shove,
[6711.30s -> 6714.74s]  I need to play something that isn't going to have issues playing under turret or something
[6714.74s -> 6719.86s]  that can shove back if I need to, right, which is why Jinks are fairly also both good.
[6723.92s -> 6726.64s]  As real again, we'll just get shoved in. Stuff like that, right.
[6726.64s -> 6731.44s]  These are things you actually have to think about when you're playing the game for certain
[6731.44s -> 6736.96s]  champions, and certain matchups. Because a lot of the time, people will pick a champion that's
[6736.96s -> 6740.64s]  meta and they won't understand why they're still losing the matchup, even though they're
[6740.64s -> 6745.20s]  good at that champion and it's just that you're not bad at the champ the matchup is just
[6745.20s -> 6751.60s]  unplayable you could put faker double it fucking gumi-asi in certain matchups and they will
[6751.60s -> 6755.92s]  just lose they will lose the matchups and it's because no matter how good your mechanics are
[6756.80s -> 6762.10s]  if the matchup is played correctly it doesn't it's not winnable and that's why you see
[6762.10s -> 6766.10s]  him pro play drafting is so important it's perfect example of why it in pro play drafting is
[6766.10s -> 6769.86s]  ten times more important than solo queue and it's because when everybody plays the matchups
[6769.86s -> 6776.83s]  correctly and shit, right? When everybody's playing the matchups correctly and shit, the matchup
[6776.83s -> 6782.83s]  like skill becomes a thousand times more important. Or like you know how the matchups being
[6782.83s -> 6788.83s]  play like the champions become way more important. Whoa, what the fuck? I'm on there just
[6788.83s -> 6797.55s]  fuck that. What the hell is going on? Another little tip for you guys. Ooh, I fuck that. But
[6797.55s -> 6811.94s]  another little tip for you guys is melee champions, or melee minions take one turret shot, two
[6811.94s -> 6821.31s]  autos or sorry. Two turretsets 1 auto and castors take one auto, one turret. When you're under turrets, like luck.
[6821.31s -> 6823.11s]  Okay, so.
[6823.11s -> 6826.51s]  Learning, this will be actually a pretty game to explain to you how to farm out of the turret.
[6826.51s -> 6831.31s]  Actually I was thinking about like what I could teach you as because we're just giving the shove down a lot this game.
[6831.31s -> 6839.98s]  It's actually not that bad though.
[6839.98s -> 6842.98s]  So right now we could actually space forward here.
[6842.98s -> 6856.35s]  Oh yeah, that did not hit me, that was BS but sure.
[6856.35s -> 6859.35s]  I did the same thing. I did last game man.
[6860.85s -> 6863.35s]  I did the same thing. You said I walked up.
[6864.35s -> 6872.35s]  It wasn't it it was a good fight, but again, I keep doing that. We're like I see the fight and I'll take the fight because I know it's a good fight.
[6873.35s -> 6882.81s]  But Louis was too far back so I ended up just inting. It's really stupid. I got a such a dumb play by me.
[6882.81s -> 6901.50s]  I mean, because I had to pull up both my sums right there because uh, the
[6901.50s -> 6904.46s]  Jin or I mean, the Jin was in a really bad spot in the car moves in a really
[6904.46s -> 6906.78s]  bad spot because I was level three and they were level two and they were
[6906.78s -> 6912.14s]  walking up to contest waves. But my, uh, Louvre was behind me and when
[6912.14s -> 6916.22s]  you're playing, you know, so will you? You have to play as a team with
[6916.22s -> 6926.18s]  your teammate. Okay, so this Jin is kind of griefing right now. He's
[6926.18s -> 6935.30s]  griefing by like walking up when I'm blue gunning him. I don't know what
[6935.30s -> 6940.66s]  I'm just killing that guy nice. Yeah, they're they're breathing really hard. So the blue guns OP for what you just saw
[6941.38s -> 6945.64s]  All you have to do with the blue gun if you really want to just like have a funny ass overpowered fucking
[6947.02s -> 6950.62s]  With their farming under the turret like that just hit the minions
[6957.87s -> 6959.87s]  Okay, we're getting gank
[6960.43s -> 6961.71s]  Back up
[6961.71s -> 6970.82s]  So I kind of did a cardinal send there. I would say if I got a send of like I
[6971.46s -> 6973.46s]  Overstate a bit. I think
[6973.46s -> 6977.46s]  Okay, we'll fuck off, dude.
[6977.46s -> 6979.46s]  That was greedy.
[6979.46s -> 6982.46s]  I should've backed that the turret, but I didn't think karma was actually new to that,
[6982.46s -> 6986.46s]  but I did overstay because you can see like this is the perfect example of why overstay.
[6986.46s -> 6988.46s]  So they stopped my back, right?
[6988.46s -> 6991.46s]  I can give you guys a really good example of what just happens.
[6991.46s -> 6996.46s]  I overstayed and when I overstayed, I didn't actually get anything out of it.
[6996.46s -> 6999.46s]  Like I got, but you saw I just have extra gold for nothing.
[6999.46s -> 7003.46s]  thing. So now I just have extra gold, right? And because I have extra gold, the
[7003.46s -> 7007.38s]  gen actually gets in that positive because they stopped my back. So he gets a free
[7007.38s -> 7011.74s]  plate here. I miss a cannon and even though I'm still up 10 C S, it's like I
[7011.74s -> 7017.38s]  could have been up 10 C S, not given a plate and not missed a cannon. So it's
[7017.38s -> 7024.14s]  it's basically like, it's interesting. Should you get prior for your jungler
[7024.14s -> 7032.80s]  every game? No, no, that's not important. Some games, prior is important. It's very important
[7032.80s -> 7038.00s]  some games, but you don't need to always be thinking about getting prior for jungler. That's
[7038.00s -> 7041.12s]  not something you should be like thinking about like always, right? Like you think about it
[7041.12s -> 7046.56s]  in terms of like timers. That's important, but prior for jungler always is not like something you
[7046.56s -> 7057.18s]  should be worrying about. Because if you're per macho and you're like, oh, I have prior for my
[7057.18s -> 7060.78s]  jungler but then your jungler doesn't do anything like having that
[7060.78s -> 7066.67s]  pride if you don't have pride it doesn't do anything like I'd rather hold
[7066.67s -> 7103.58s]  the wave and like a certain spot oh my god i suck i mean it worked out i
[7103.58s -> 7111.10s]  think if i was six i triple kill them there but i think we actually
[7111.10s -> 7115.10s]  oh i think we actually triple kill them too if we will help to me but again
[7115.10s -> 7160.08s]  you guys know what i'm gonna say i go back to the thing
[7160.08s -> 7167.73s]  I don't know if Ranger has ulti or not, I want to shove this because
[7175.31s -> 7186.93s]  chill. I want to shove it in for seconds and I really don't have anything to do so I'll just stand here.
[7186.93s -> 7192.69s]  You want to also be back back, once it's hit for one day by boots. I bought boots. I fell
[7192.69s -> 7197.09s]  in a second so you can buy boots running early. He's like, he's a champion where the more attacks
[7197.09s -> 7202.05s]  you do is actually very valuable and positioning on a failure is very important. It's kind of like
[7202.05s -> 7207.37s]  Some AD carries like you don't need boots really early like with like jinks for example
[7207.37s -> 7213.21s]  I usually go free boots, right or I go boots like after my cracking but with a
[7213.21s -> 7219.21s]  failures I really like the early mobility the early trading stuff like that's
[7224.29s -> 7227.93s]  Okay, so always be watching the map too. We see the rangars top, right?
[7228.45s -> 7230.93s]  We can actually just straight fight these guys to be too right now
[7230.93s -> 7242.35s]  Um, uh, but wait, what, what's my lulu doing?
[7242.35s -> 7243.35s]  Help me?
[7243.35s -> 7255.89s]  What, what are we, he's holding us.
[7255.89s -> 7268.98s]  So, you're saying, helping the 80 carriers back, got it.
[7268.98s -> 7274.86s]  I can't believe my lulu just walked away from me and just like, watched, like, you
[7274.86s -> 7277.54s]  work as a team.
[7277.54s -> 7282.59s]  This is something that I cannot stress enough.
[7282.59s -> 7289.15s]  as a team when you play League of Legends. This tells me more than anything because this happens
[7289.15s -> 7296.91s]  even in Grandmaster, I see teammates who will be selfish and not help each other. Just help each
[7296.91s -> 7310.45s]  other. Help each other please man. We are a team. Don't just run and leave your ADC. I'm not even
[7310.45s -> 7317.81s]  flaming you, but like dude, you can't do that. You can't be upset that like, like I can't dodge every spell.
[7317.81s -> 7321.49s]  Well, come to the league. I feel like something that I noticed that happens a lot.
[7321.49s -> 7327.73s]  Yeah, how do you get your players? Well, have this weirdly high expectation for everyone to play
[7327.73s -> 7334.37s]  absolutely perfect at all times. And they want me to like, be goofy, I see. And I'm like, dude,
[7334.37s -> 7340.97s]  I dodged two of the jinn bullets. I dodged a karma cue like you would have it
[7340.97s -> 7344.25s]  Like I can't dodge literally everything will slow, right? Like that's not how it works
[7344.97s -> 7355.34s]  Like dude, I'm gonna lose my mind with this guy
[7356.30s -> 7397.36s]  I will you is blaming me. It's okay. It's okay. I don't need to be upset
[7398.24s -> 7400.24s]  It's fine
[7400.24s -> 7402.24s]  The movie player
[7402.52s -> 7404.52s]  It's totally okay
[7404.52s -> 7412.82s]  You know, sometimes people think they're right. It's just
[7413.54s -> 7428.17s]  What happens in the world's right? It's just it is what it is. No big deal
[7428.89s -> 7447.30s]  Sorry, I'm trying really hard to not be an asshole right now. This will be a player is making me like
[7448.22s -> 7452.14s]  Make me one of like fun Panos, you know what I mean like this guy is like making me
[7452.14s -> 7459.10s]  I mean, like this guy, like we talk about, like, in league, we talk about like the players,
[7459.10s -> 7467.26s]  like we talk about 80 carry players having ego. I genuinely think support players have five
[7467.26s -> 7476.18s]  times the ego 80 carry players have, but with like a third of the skill. I think 80 carry
[7476.18s -> 7484.06s]  players do have massive egos, but again, I don't think that like, I think support players
[7484.06s -> 7489.02s]  are genuinely the dumbest mother-fucking humans on the planet and they think that they're
[7489.02s -> 7493.30s]  the best players to ever touch the game and it hurts my fucking balls.
[7493.30s -> 7517.42s]  Hey, Lulu.
[7517.42s -> 7521.54s]  Would you be willing to have a...
[7521.54s -> 7527.26s]  ...vod review with me in this sport after the game?
[7527.26s -> 7528.26s]  Let's just see.
[7528.26s -> 7531.14s]  I want to see if like this person is willing to listen to reason.
[7531.14s -> 7557.09s]  Let's see.
[7557.09s -> 7560.09s]  I'm trying to not tell, but it's really frustrating.
[7561.09s -> 7564.09s]  Because this player is playing specifically for KDA.
[7565.09s -> 7568.09s]  And they're playing, like they don't understand how, like,
[7568.09s -> 7571.09s]  I can already tell you, if I go look at this person's OP.G,
[7571.09s -> 7573.09s]  they only play for KDA.
[7573.09s -> 7578.09s]  I can tell you right now, right here, this person plays only for KDA.
[7578.09s -> 7580.09s]  Never takes any risks.
[7580.09s -> 7582.09s]  Doesn't ever help their 80 carry ever.
[7582.09s -> 7584.09s]  When they get behind, doesn't ever walk up to like,
[7584.09s -> 7586.09s]  try and fight, doesn't do any of that.
[7586.09s -> 7590.17s]  that. I can tell you right now without even looking at their OP.GG from how this person plays,
[7590.73s -> 7599.74s]  that they have high KDAs, but really well win rate. But I don't want my entire stream to be
[7599.74s -> 7602.78s]  be bitching about this Lulu, so we'll try and focus on how to win from this position.
[7603.58s -> 7607.10s]  I'm sure you guys get shitty supports too. So we'll try and focus on how to win from the
[7607.10s -> 7624.01s]  car position around. Yeah, it doesn't get better. I mean, I'll be honest with you, my grandmaster
[7624.01s -> 7629.61s]  supports on my main sock. Like, it doesn't get better. They get better like mechanically at the game,
[7629.61s -> 7636.33s]  Right like the higher elo supports get better mechanically, but they get worse. They don't get better when like
[7637.05s -> 7654.09s]  It doesn't get better. It's always like you either have a really good support or you have somebody who sniffs glue. I'm just dead. Or I'm not dead
[7676.04s -> 7680.84s]  Uh, honestly our biggest issue here is I need to get one therster a-sap
[7681.56s -> 7683.56s]  Once I get BT the game gets a lot easier
[7692.34s -> 7694.34s]  We could kill this guy right now
[7694.34s -> 7700.34s]  If the rule helps me, we can actually just straight kill these guys, because I can ulti to kill myself, right?
[7700.34s -> 7704.34s]  We have Louis ult, I have ult to kill myself, and I'm strong.
[7704.34s -> 7712.34s]  She has ignite, I have everything where we could easily kill that Talia right there.
[7712.34s -> 7715.34s]  I mean, yeah, whatever man.
[7715.34s -> 7717.34s]  This is what I'm talking about.
[7717.34s -> 7727.40s]  Again, are you willing to get into discord and bother with it?
[7727.40s -> 7736.74s]  Yes or no?
[7736.74s -> 7739.24s]  I mean, I have to be honest with you.
[7739.24s -> 7744.30s]  The reason this is frustrating is because as an AD carry player,
[7744.30s -> 7747.30s]  you want to be able to rely on your support, right?
[7747.30s -> 7751.30s]  You want to be able to make plays, go in, fight and rely on your teammates
[7751.30s -> 7754.30s]  because as an AD carry player, support an AD or like a duo, right?
[7754.30s -> 7756.30s]  Like you want to play it together.
[7756.30s -> 7764.62s]  No, no, man, I'm not attacking you, I'm saying, let's discord after.
[7764.62s -> 7776.00s]  You can explain your POV and I'll explain mine.
[7776.00s -> 7781.36s]  Maybe we can improve this player, like get them to be a better player and not ruin every
[7781.36s -> 7784.48s]  game they play in.
[7784.48s -> 7793.54s]  Like that would be the goat, like that did not hit me by the way, that hitbox is
[7793.54s -> 7822.87s]  yes, but I don't even understand. Oh, man. This is the person's by the way. This is
[7822.87s -> 7829.11s]  the person's LP.G. Average win rate 50% win rate, like I said, has really good
[7829.11s -> 7837.79s]  KDA's on all his champs. But he doesn't win. I'm telling you right now, the biggest
[7837.79s -> 7843.03s]  thing in league that the the biggest thing in league of legends is believing that you
[7843.03s -> 7849.19s]  a good player based on KDA. If I go look at any challenger level support player right now,
[7850.07s -> 7857.03s]  their KDAs will be like four. They'll still have good KDA, but it'll be like four and three,
[7857.03s -> 7862.79s]  and it'll be on, that's your mutual. I'm going to be real what you write out to you.
[7863.91s -> 7870.71s]  This Lugu player, I, you could tell me that this person sniffed glue as a kid and their parents
[7870.71s -> 7875.91s]  never told them to stop and I would believe you. I'm not even meaning like I would say that makes sense.
[7877.43s -> 7881.27s]  I mean, like I said I don't I don't even care. I don't care if it's a girl a guy. The
[7881.27s -> 7885.75s]  girl thing is like that doesn't bother me, right? Like it could be a girl a guy a pigeon. They could they could
[7885.75s -> 7892.95s]  fucking they could relate as a fucking peanut in a in a fucking plane. I don't care about that at all.
[7896.25s -> 7898.01s]  You know what I mean like said that shit doesn't bother me at all.
[7898.01s -> 7902.85s]  like then be like I actually think it's stupid when people are like oh it's an
[7902.85s -> 7907.31s]  e-girl e-girl e-girl. I think that's dumb as shit because that argument's so
[7907.31s -> 7911.37s]  crap because like I don't give a shit if it's a guy or girl because like you
[7911.37s -> 7914.57s]  know what I mean I'm more upset at the fact that this person is delugimant than
[7914.57s -> 7931.32s]  anything that's like what's tilting me here I'm just gonna mute we'll do one
[7931.32s -> 7934.88s]  more game on this account after this game and I'm gonna mute from the start of
[7934.88s -> 7945.26s]  the game for you guys. Okay. Dude, if he didn't actually get me into the wall there,
[7945.26s -> 7948.78s]  I tried to walk forward so that I wouldn't get condemned into the wall if he didn't
[7948.78s -> 7955.82s]  stun me. I kill him. That's annoying. That was actually such a good hitbox for him.
[7955.82s -> 7974.51s]  My bad. Nice. You check them. Nice job. If you're wondering why I'm even here, by the way,
[7974.51s -> 7978.67s]  I'm actually, I'm not trolling. I'm trying to get this turret because this gives me a lot of
[7978.67s -> 7982.91s]  gold. At the moment, I'm not actually worth that much gold. There's nothing going on in the
[7982.91s -> 7986.59s]  map, there's no objective or anything like that, right? So I'm trying to push in top waves
[7986.59s -> 7991.87s]  right now so that I can get gold to try and like hyper and flight my two items before this
[7991.87s -> 7996.59s]  next dragon. Because this next dragon is going to be incredibly important if we want any
[7996.59s -> 8002.19s]  chance to win. We have to win this next dragon. And the only way for me to do that is to
[8002.19s -> 8009.23s]  either get really lucky or go get some gold in a side win. It's just support difference every
[8009.23s -> 8015.31s]  Again, it is. I want to point this out. This person is playing this victim complex bullshit.
[8015.63s -> 8018.27s]  Like, you know what I mean, but it is. It is actually support.
[8018.99s -> 8056.99s]  Sorry. I'm tilted. I'm playing bad this game.
[8058.43s -> 8061.63s]  I think the mute these players because these players are actually tilting me.
[8063.15s -> 8066.83s]  Like, I was fined with it before, but I'm actually giving it a little irritated. That's make me play bad.
[8067.79s -> 8069.95s]  So I need to mute them so I don't keep in tune.
[8072.13s -> 8074.85s]  But it's affecting my gameplay and it's pissing me off.
[8074.85s -> 8078.37s]  That's just my bad.
[8078.37s -> 8087.31s]  T-split, are you here?
[8087.31s -> 8088.31s]  T?
[8088.31s -> 8091.71s]  The, oh, T, message to the slurler.
[8091.71s -> 8092.99s]  I mean this in the nicest way.
[8092.99s -> 8095.51s]  I don't even wanna be toxic.
[8095.51s -> 8101.25s]  I genuinely wanna use this for content.
[8101.25s -> 8103.53s]  Like this guy's been flaming me the whole game.
[8103.53s -> 8105.85s]  Like I wanna use this for content to show you guys
[8105.85s -> 8109.25s]  that it is so easy to tell people how the game should be
[8109.25s -> 8110.09s]  played.
[8110.09s -> 8113.45s]  So easy if you, if you can communicate, by talking.
[8113.45s -> 8120.25s]  because this guy's been doing nothing but flaming me the entire game this is what we're
[8120.25s -> 8125.65s]  right but he's an absolute like he played the lane completely bad then he
[8125.65s -> 8130.67s]  then he stopped trying to win stop shielding me stopped doing anything right after
[8130.67s -> 8135.97s]  he played the lane bad then he started playing the victim thing when I asked him
[8135.97s -> 8139.49s]  to be a human and like come over and like help me and play teamwork you got him or
[8139.49s -> 8143.33s]  I didn't play my single time right I didn't say a single negative thing to this guy
[8143.33s -> 8153.65s]  I said let's work as a team he got upset like I genuinely think it'd be great content if I could talk to this guy in this
[8153.65s -> 8176.90s]  Gordon and just like oh, I'd be so good. I'm trying to kill these people guys
[8177.66s -> 8184.32s]  That wasn't bad though. We got 800 gold not the worst, but I don't know if my team can install this
[8185.08s -> 8187.28s]  Maybe thinking like kill this they can stall it, but
[8191.54s -> 8195.82s]  No, they yeah, that's that's GG that was just disgusting. Tell me of you
[8195.82s -> 8237.98s]  I'm going to add him and he'll probably not add me, but I'm I'm out of this old try.
[8237.98s -> 8243.25s]  This would be such a good warning experience.
[8243.25s -> 8252.73s]  Oh, excuse me.
[8252.73s -> 8254.73s]  Dude, I've had a bad heartburn today.
[8254.73s -> 8256.73s]  I need to take one of those heartburn pills.
[8256.73s -> 8263.75s]  What, what, what, what, man?
[8263.75s -> 8264.75s]  Just say it.
[8264.75s -> 8265.75s]  Just what about?
[8265.75s -> 8266.75s]  What about?
[8266.75s -> 8270.83s]  What about, baby?
[8270.83s -> 8271.83s]  Yo.
[8271.83s -> 8275.14s]  What, what?
[8275.14s -> 8277.14s]  Let's just have a talk.
[8277.14s -> 8280.35s]  Yo.
[8280.35s -> 8282.35s]  Let's discord.
[8282.35s -> 8307.01s]  We can bother you. Since I'm so bad. Yeah, trust. You just blamed everyone,
[8307.01s -> 8318.62s]  put yourself, but you didn't play correctly at all. You played land completely wrong.
[8318.62s -> 8326.00s]  Didn't help each other. Left people to die on repeats.
[8326.00s -> 8366.24s]  and played a victim. I genuinely want to help you.
[8366.24s -> 8374.24s]  This guy screenshot it, what I just said, and put it in the end game chat.
[8374.24s -> 8387.08s]  What is happening right now? What is going on?
[8387.08s -> 8398.40s]  There is no way that this is not an NPC.
[8398.40s -> 8414.94s]  There is no way. This is not an NPC. There's no way. There's no way. It's
[8414.94s -> 8422.94s]  Geronimova Mal. It is me. Yes. Bro, just come talk in discord. I'm not even going
[8422.94s -> 8437.21s]  to flame you. What does this even mean? Bro, I don't think I've seen anybody more
[8437.21s -> 8451.77s]  insecure in my life. Bro, you are so insecure. It's cringe. How insecure you are. Like,
[8451.77s -> 8469.34s]  oof. Go back, man. On the climb to masters, but Jesus Christ, that's sad. Oh god, I
[8470.06s -> 8474.78s]  do an audio note to say, like, I'm gonna be real. I was like, I'm not even gonna flame the guy,
[8474.78s -> 8482.14s]  right? I just genuinely want to like improves the community. Because that was the
[8482.14s -> 8486.66s]  restrate supports in a row that didn't know how to play Lulu and I'd not even
[8486.66s -> 8489.58s]  gonna flame the guy's skill. He's not a Lulu player, right? He doesn't play
[8489.58s -> 8495.02s]  Lulu. That's fine. But the issue was that I had with that guy specifically was
[8495.02s -> 8500.14s]  that it's okay to be bad at the game, right? There's nothing wrong with being
[8500.14s -> 8504.02s]  bad at league. Everybody has bad games, but when we're playing a game together
[8504.02s -> 8510.74s]  and you're saying it's winnable and you want to win the game, you can't pick and choose who to help win the game.
[8511.86s -> 8519.62s]  Like if I'm sitting there bot lane, we're both being doked by Jin and you're intentionally trying not to take damage and not die,
[8519.62s -> 8526.90s]  because you want to value your KDA over everything else so that you know what hold on let me think about this.
[8526.90s -> 8530.90s]  I think I've figured this person out.
[8530.90s -> 8532.90s]  This person lives in delusion.
[8532.90s -> 8533.90s]  And I think I figured this out.
[8533.90s -> 8534.90s]  Let me explain this.
[8534.90s -> 8538.90s]  A lot of players do this, but I think I'm figuring this out as I'm thinking about this.
[8538.90s -> 8543.90s]  So, this person has really good KDAs on the profile, right?
[8543.90s -> 8545.90s]  This, like, this eye catching person.
[8545.90s -> 8547.90s]  They've really, really good KDAs on the profile, right?
[8547.90s -> 8550.90s]  This person doesn't ever take risks.
[8550.90s -> 8555.90s]  Doesn't ever do anything to try and win the game outside of, like,
[8555.90s -> 8563.16s]  of like just the existing and hitting buttons. And what they do is they will always have good
[8563.16s -> 8568.76s]  kDAs and they will they will sit here and never like I know why they're losing. They will
[8568.76s -> 8572.20s]  sit here and they will do this shit where they have good kDAs they they they they don't ever
[8572.20s -> 8577.48s]  die that much blah blah blah. But what they do is they lie to themselves and they say look how
[8577.48s -> 8589.16s]  good my kDAs are. If I have better teammates I'd always win like I cracked the code actually that's
[8589.16s -> 8590.96s]  That's totally what it is.
[8590.96s -> 8597.00s]  The players actually play so safe and they play for statistics, right?
[8597.00s -> 8599.64s]  They play purely for the stats.
[8599.64s -> 8604.20s]  And then they can say that it was their teams fault that they didn't win because they
[8604.20s -> 8612.70s]  played really bad, but they didn't die.
[8612.70s -> 8618.18s]  Because I mean, in theory, I could have a perfect KDA on every 80 carry I play, right?
[8618.18s -> 8623.06s]  All I have to do is literally walk up, get one kill, and then AFK and stand on the base
[8623.06s -> 8626.28s]  the rest of the game. And I could be like,
[8626.28s -> 8627.58s]  yo, why's my team not able to carry?
[8627.58s -> 8631.97s]  What's happening? Right?
[8632.37s -> 8633.57s]  Like you could literally do that.
[8633.97s -> 8636.57s]  No, I seriously think the person's self gaslighting himself.
[8638.07s -> 8640.67s]  Like, I'm serious. I think this person's like self gaslighting,
[8640.87s -> 8643.37s]  where they, they're like, oh, it's my team's fault every game.
[8643.77s -> 8645.67s]  Right? Like, they're always blaming their team for their,
[8645.67s -> 8647.87s]  their loses and then mistakes and shit.
[8648.27s -> 8651.47s]  And it's sad because like, there's a reason you're D 2.
[8651.67s -> 8653.77s]  And I'm not saying that to be toxic. I'm saying that like,
[8653.77s -> 8655.57s]  you haven't improved in four years.
[8655.57s -> 8664.37s]  And you have to improve because all you're doing is playing to play in your team every single game when I just saw like 500 mistakes that you made that we could have won the game off of early game
[8664.77s -> 8676.26s]  Here I remember somebody wanted me to play a cape when game last game. So we're gonna play cape
[8677.34s -> 8680.78s]  I don't remember I don't remember who it was in the chat somebody like two people said cape
[8681.34s -> 8683.34s]  But we'll do a cake game for you guys
[8684.06s -> 8708.03s]  I got you guys somewhere. All right. I'm gonna take ghost flash because they have three madlight champs four madlight champs
[8708.03s -> 8712.19s]  if they have Verkhanzed, Clad, Grigas, so I'm gonna take Ghostfash.
[8712.19s -> 8715.19s]  These are gonna be my runes this game.
[8715.19s -> 8718.87s]  I'm gonna take a little more MR because I don't think we're gonna be fighting too much in lane,
[8718.87s -> 8722.59s]  or pretty much just gonna be poking them with ComaKate.
[8722.59s -> 8725.43s]  So I'm gonna take a little bit extra MR because I'm gonna be playing for mid-delay game.
[8725.43s -> 8737.51s]  I'm just scaling, and these are gonna be the runes that I take.
[8737.51s -> 8742.91s]  You can call us on AD Carry, or the easier to play once, and AD Carry, I usually do, like,
[8742.91s -> 8746.39s]  But when I'm playing on this account right now, this is like my teaching accounts.
[8746.39s -> 8749.35s]  It's a little lower MMR, it's like D1 low masters.
[8749.35s -> 8754.99s]  I usually play 80 carries that like the chat wants to see me play, so that you guys can
[8754.99s -> 8759.03s]  learn like good and bad matchups and things like that's.
[8759.03s -> 8764.51s]  The last two games I got way too tilted by shitty support players, like egos and all
[8764.51s -> 8769.39s]  that shit, I got way too frustrated and I played bad the last two games, so we're going to,
[8769.39s -> 8772.75s]  honestly, I'm just going to mute these people with a very start of the game.
[8772.75s -> 8777.75s]  So I'm really, I wouldn't suggest you, maybe people because like playing as a team is really important.
[8777.75s -> 8782.75s]  Because like, you know, you need to communicate in all that shit, but I am just, like, I'm gonna mute them.
[8782.75s -> 8789.75s]  Because I, dude, my mental is taking a fucking hit right now, so we're gonna just chill and play.
[8789.75s -> 8795.73s]  I, I just don't know how to play Naba.
[8795.73s -> 8798.73s]  I think Naba is really good. I just don't, I don't know how to play her.
[8798.73s -> 8804.26s]  I think she's a great champ.
[8804.26s -> 8810.26s]  Well, I've been getting shit on by nylon on my main account, like a lot of grandmaster nilas have been dumpstring me.
[8820.06s -> 8822.62s]  I think she's just really good at abusing solo queue.
[8823.82s -> 8828.30s]  Like the issue with nylon is from what I've seen all the losses I've had with nylon.
[8829.34s -> 8832.06s]  People don't, it's like the thing I was telling you about before.
[8833.02s -> 8837.82s]  People don't play aggressively in the lower e-lose, like even in grandmaster.
[8837.82s -> 8841.02s]  People don't play aggressively enough. It sounds crazy to say that, but it's true.
[8841.02s -> 8848.10s]  They don't play aggressively enough in way and so you can get away with just picking Nila and scaling and Nila at like one item
[8848.10s -> 8850.66s]  You'll always be up in levels right because that's how the champion works
[8852.06s -> 8860.70s]  The champion works in like you'll always be up in levels because of her passive. So you basically just like scale through existing
[8861.14s -> 8863.14s]  It's pretty it's pretty interesting
[8864.34s -> 8870.27s]  All right, so we're playing Kate Karma. Oh, I missed them in him because I suck
[8871.47s -> 8873.47s]  I'm gonna ward this bush
[8873.47s -> 8883.84s]  uh... just because i don't want to return in the bush
[8883.84s -> 8887.84s]  so now that the bush isn't working anymore um... okay what a nice
[8887.84s -> 8892.34s]  i was gonna say what i want to do is i actually want to play
[8892.34s -> 8893.58s]  uh... i suck
[8893.58s -> 8898.14s]  i actually want to play home and i'm so bad at k i want to play on the top side of the wave
[8898.14s -> 8901.34s]  so that i'm not standing near the bush is right
[8901.34s -> 8904.14s]  because if you stand near the bush is
[8904.14s -> 8907.10s]  the recon can obviously like w man i just get fucked so
[8907.10s -> 8909.82s]  i'd rather play in a safer spot
[8909.82s -> 8912.78s]  Can't wait, I missed you, see ya, I'm so fucking bad.
[8912.78s -> 8915.50s]  Now I wanna push in Wave 3 and I wanna go buy a coal.
[8915.50s -> 8925.74s]  So I'm gonna ping to push.
[8925.74s -> 8926.58s]  Okay.
[8927.46s -> 8930.54s]  So I actually wanna back here and I'm gonna go buy a coal.
[8930.54s -> 8932.14s]  So this is called a cheater recall.
[8933.66s -> 8938.18s]  You usually have perfect CS to back on this timer.
[8938.18s -> 8940.74s]  Go and you can go buy a coal, okay?
[8940.74s -> 8942.50s]  This is like something that you can do
[8942.50s -> 8944.90s]  if you're in a lane that's gonna be permish on.
[8944.90s -> 8946.10s]  So what happens is the reason that's called
[8946.10s -> 8952.74s]  to recall is because we pushed the wave in, they had to stay and form the wave, right?
[8952.74s -> 8960.51s]  Now watch. They have to push this wave in, right? Now if karma was here instead of roaming,
[8960.51s -> 8963.51s]  this realm is fine by the way. But if she was here instead of roaming, she could actually
[8963.51s -> 8969.91s]  hold the wave. And if you notice here, I don't actually miss that many minions, right?
[8969.91s -> 8980.35s]  We're chilling. Now we can so-push this or safe. I should actually fast-push this because
[8980.35s -> 8987.79s]  I want it to bounce. I don't want to sopish this but I can't I can't fast-push this at level three by myself
[8992.39s -> 8994.39s]  So we're just gonna chill
[8994.63s -> 8997.79s]  Camans really good at abusing like early lane phase
[8998.23s -> 9003.47s]  Bullying just based on like what our kit does. We see we're con on the map top side to get you see that's
[9004.51s -> 9011.09s]  So because we see we're con I can walk up a bit and we could play a little aggro here
[9011.53s -> 9021.08s]  You can kind of see like I don't have to play behind the minion wave
[9021.08s -> 9026.34s]  You see what I'm doing to this guy right? I hate this game. We can quit. We can we can four foot. It's fun
[9026.68s -> 9034.05s]  I hate this game. I hate this game. I really hate this game
[9034.77s -> 9037.81s]  Dude, what is wrong with me right now? It's like my brain doesn't work
[9038.25s -> 9049.06s]  It's the 280 catener telling you so Recon's gonna be bought right now
[9050.50s -> 9052.50s]  I know he's gonna be bought
[9052.50s -> 9054.50s]  So I need to be a little care
[9054.70s -> 9056.70s]  Now my karma is here
[9056.70s -> 9062.23s]  There we go. So you know so I didn't use any spells. I'm not I'm just chillin
[9062.23s -> 9068.82s]  Dude, are you kidding me, man?
[9068.82s -> 9071.52s]  I'm going to be honest.
[9071.52s -> 9074.52s]  I'm getting really tilted by these players now.
[9074.52s -> 9076.52s]  Like the Recon W's in,
[9076.52s -> 9080.52s]  they just stand there and watch me die.
[9080.52s -> 9082.52s]  Okay, it's fine.
[9082.52s -> 9083.52s]  Listen, I'm not going to get too mad about it.
[9083.52s -> 9084.52s]  It's fine.
[9084.52s -> 9085.52s]  I should have flashed the knock-up.
[9085.52s -> 9087.52s]  I guess even though in reality,
[9087.52s -> 9089.52s]  I should never have to flash the knock-up.
[9089.52s -> 9092.52s]  But I should have flashed it because I can't trust the teammates.
[9092.52s -> 9094.52s]  So what I'm saying is right there,
[9094.52s -> 9099.74s]  In federal we're both right here. I was being chased down. They they stood here. They didn't they didn't walk up to do anything
[9099.94s -> 9101.94s]  They just stood and waited
[9102.54s -> 9105.38s]  That pisses me off because I hate when players
[9106.40s -> 9108.40s]  play
[9108.40s -> 9115.37s]  Selfish and scared. It's my biggest pet peeve. It drives me fucking crazy, man
[9116.53s -> 9127.06s]  Sorry, I'm getting I'm losing my mind like it's so easy. It's fine though
[9127.06s -> 9155.13s]  I shouldn't have walked up and egoed it. It's on me. I want to so push this way. I'm losing it this by the way
[9155.13s -> 9162.80s]  would be an example of a bad time for karma to run. She needs to come back, but there's absolutely no
[9162.80s -> 9167.28s]  reason for the room on that timer. There's also no reason for it to be in that bush over there.
[9167.28s -> 9170.86s]  We should be playing up to try to where we're playing Kate Karma, right? We should be
[9170.86s -> 9175.56s]  playing forward so that we can actually be aggressive. Kate Karma's a wane boolean. We don't
[9175.56s -> 9179.36s]  want to sit here and just do nothing. If you pick karma, you want to be aggressive. You want
[9179.36s -> 9182.40s]  to be playing up you want to be stunning you want to be doing like aggressive things
[9182.40s -> 9197.35s]  playing the game. We're about to six I'd really like to like go in yeah like that was
[9197.35s -> 9201.59s]  actually not bad by the karma she w the zia and then I got to trap off of it so that
[9201.59s -> 9224.56s]  wasn't too bad. Not the worst. Not bad. That was good. That was good.
[9224.56s -> 9228.64s]  Really nice really nice okay so I'm gonna back here because I don't want to overstate for
[9228.64s -> 9251.56s]  the way I'm gonna grab boots. You don't think a lot of it is too. I think a lot of it is
[9251.56s -> 9253.24s]  is people get really scared when they, like,
[9253.24s -> 9255.00s]  Rakan is really strong in this meta, right?
[9255.00s -> 9256.36s]  Like, he's very, very powerful.
[9256.36s -> 9258.60s]  He is like numbers are a little too high right now,
[9258.60s -> 9261.12s]  so like everything he does is just a little too good.
[9261.12s -> 9262.80s]  So I think people get nervous around Rakan,
[9262.80s -> 9264.52s]  especially with Zaya, because it's like
[9264.52s -> 9266.68s]  when people would get nervous around Nami-Ocean.
[9266.68s -> 9268.56s]  The lane, like, plays itself, it's very strong,
[9268.56s -> 9271.08s]  it's very hard to beat, but you can still see people
[9271.08s -> 9272.44s]  making mistakes when they play the lane,
[9272.44s -> 9280.35s]  so you gotta watch for that type of stuff.
[9280.35s -> 9282.75s]  Now, a good way to play against Zaya,
[9282.75s -> 9289.95s]  Once you hit six, is you don't want to,
[9291.47s -> 9294.03s]  you don't want to ever walk melee range of her,
[9294.03s -> 9297.07s]  or give her the ability to just kill you with the feathers.
[9297.07s -> 9299.19s]  Your main goal here is gonna be,
[9299.19s -> 9302.71s]  try and stay in a good spot when it comes to feathers.
[9302.71s -> 9304.83s]  I got one to be to the side of her.
[9304.83s -> 9306.31s]  The side of her is the best option,
[9306.31s -> 9307.47s]  like where she can't pull in,
[9307.47s -> 9309.23s]  like I'll get hit by maybe a few,
[9309.23s -> 9312.75s]  but she can't pull in all of them.
[9312.75s -> 9316.43s]  That's a really key thing when playing versus her,
[9316.43s -> 9318.77s]  because I remember back in the day, I didn't know how to play Versailles
[9318.77s -> 9321.39s]  and I would always get fucking frost rate of this shit.
[9321.39s -> 9322.55s]  So Recon's 5.
[9322.55s -> 9325.39s]  I wanted to have, see Recon's 5.
[9325.39s -> 9329.85s]  We shouldn't be able to die here.
[9329.85s -> 9331.29s]  I wanna push this wave in,
[9331.29s -> 9336.16s]  but I also need to stay away from where the Recon can be.
[9336.16s -> 9338.68s]  So if you wanna push Wave Stain in and reset the wave,
[9340.40s -> 9342.16s]  make sure that your standing as far away as you can
[9342.16s -> 9349.21s]  from where they can engage on you.
[9349.21s -> 9351.13s]  Now, they're about to be six, Recon is.
[9351.13s -> 9352.61s]  So they have a really strong level six.
[9352.61s -> 9354.61s]  She has pickaxe and Nunequiver.
[9354.61s -> 9356.05s]  We do want to be a little hesitant here.
[9356.05s -> 9357.21s]  We don't want to fight.
[9358.65s -> 9361.93s]  Now, I'm going to kind of push the Senate bit.
[9361.93s -> 9363.93s]  We should have been spam pushing the whole wave
[9363.93s -> 9366.45s]  because that's how K-Carmac players we just push.
[9366.45s -> 9368.25s]  Push, push, push, push.
[9368.25s -> 9371.69s]  But we played that early roam by Carmo.
[9372.81s -> 9374.57s]  Kind of put us behind on that.
[9375.61s -> 9376.45s]  It's not a big deal.
[9376.45s -> 9383.36s]  It's just something that we have to adjust.
[9383.36s -> 9388.32s]  Why does this say 88 and this say 90?
[9388.32s -> 9398.24s]  Which one is it?
[9398.24s -> 9407.69s]  Is it 88 or 90?
[9407.69s -> 9409.09s]  I mean, that guy's dead.
[9410.37s -> 9415.32s]  I don't know what that karma's thinking, but we probably
[9415.32s -> 9420.20s]  have to give this trick.
[9420.20s -> 9422.32s]  I mean, maybe we could fight it if it'll have all teeth,
[9422.32s -> 9431.30s]  but he'm not having all the other's nowhere.
[9431.30s -> 9433.86s]  The higher one counts ward kills.
[9433.86s -> 9435.18s]  Why?
[9436.46s -> 9438.06s]  I think that's so stupid.
[9438.06s -> 9440.06s]  So they might try and engage here.
[9440.06s -> 9442.06s]  unless they somehow know
[9442.06s -> 9444.06s]  fettles in the bush
[9444.06s -> 9446.06s]  which would be impressive because we know it's not warded
[9446.06s -> 9449.63s]  so that'd be pretty impressive if they knew that
[9449.63s -> 9465.23s]  we could actually refts
[9465.23s -> 9472.96s]  i'm just gonna ghost
[9472.96s -> 9480.32s]  this is crazy what the fuck
[9480.32s -> 9486.70s]  oh this is interesting
[9486.70s -> 9488.70s]  they saw fettle 100% yeah i don't know where though
[9488.70s -> 9490.70s]  it musta because he used this thing
[9490.70s -> 9496.08s]  but i'll use this uh whatever it's called
[9496.08s -> 9498.08s]  his effigy
[9498.08s -> 9509.50s]  one million. I guess I didn't see it. I should back. I can get dope here. We don't know where Greg
[9509.50s -> 9513.82s]  is says like if Greg is happens to be like he's over this wall or something. I can get dope
[9513.82s -> 9521.26s]  really easy. I'm greeting really hard. greeting usually gets you killed. Typically I shouldn't be
[9521.26s -> 9530.46s]  doing this. They're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right? It's like if you
[9530.46s -> 9539.34s]  know something is going to be a bad habit you should not do it. Just cue the bush. Okay, that was, I met you
[9539.34s -> 9553.10s]  like an actual cue. They could also be in the alcove, so my little hesitant, but that's fine. Okay, so the
[9553.10s -> 9558.14s]  reason I stayed was because now I have my, I have my method, correct? Because we, we finished the
[9558.14s -> 9563.90s]  call and we finished the method at the same time or finished the wave. So now I have two options. I
[9563.90s -> 9570.38s]  go gale force here to dodge a lot of their shits or I can do what sounds like a fun option
[9571.98s -> 9577.02s]  we're going to do shield though. I'm going to show you guys why I like shield bow on Caitlyn.
[9578.14s -> 9584.86s]  It's not the best mythic, but it's good into certain comps. If you don't want to get
[9584.86s -> 9593.82s]  uh, go. Because I have a lacquerity this game, I don't have bloodline, right? So I kind of want to
[9593.82s -> 9610.81s]  go shield bow and then I'm going to end up going either i.e. or I'm going like 1-3 seconds i.e. or p.t.
[9612.33s -> 9617.69s]  Probably i.e. just because I think it's actually easier to go i.e. this game.
[9624.72s -> 9628.40s]  But yeah, this is a kind of boring game. Our teams don't really well though, so we just chill.
[9637.00s -> 9658.40s]  We got to be a little care. Okay. It was kind of hard to do anything there. Even though I got
[9658.40s -> 9662.16s]  like a few autos on the gruggess. It's a little difficult to actually play the game there.
[9667.24s -> 9671.24s]  Because if I walk up too far, like see where concert. If I walk up too far, I just get
[9671.80s -> 9681.34s]  killed by Rakan. Alright, I'm just gonna reset and go get boots. Typically, any carry is really
[9681.34s -> 9693.87s]  fucking boring in games like this where you can't really blow the game open. Oh, I'm dead.
[9693.87s -> 9702.08s]  Maybe wait, karma shield me. I'm not done. Nice. Fuck!
[9721.40s -> 9728.28s]  Monukbucker Kobe'd me Matt. There's like goven. We can fight this though. They have no ults.
[9728.28s -> 9741.73s]  Like this is actually fightable. They have no XIRR and no, uh, bragasr.
[9741.73s -> 9746.73s]  And this is also why it's really important that you relate to your team, the cooldowns of your team.
[9746.73s -> 9750.73s]  Remember that. Don't forget that. If somebody uses a big cooldown, tell your team.
[9750.73s -> 9756.57s]  Because that was an illegal dragon, right? Like they just that was one of the most illegal things I've seen in the wild
[9757.57s -> 9781.88s]  Homey completely grief that that's another very very very important thing that you need to take away from playing
[9782.16s -> 9784.96s]  League and being like this is the one I was saying about a team work and shit earlier
[9786.36s -> 9789.80s]  Being good at the game is a lot of spreading knowledge as well, right?
[9790.88s -> 9796.00s]  Like if you if your team doesn't know if a flash is up or down you have to play completely differently, right?
[9796.00s -> 9800.08s]  But you got to think about the game in that in terms of that as well. Like how many times have you seen like
[9800.48s -> 9804.16s]  You know, you're like oh, I can walk up here if this guy can't flash-alt me or something, right?
[9807.93s -> 9832.08s]  It happens all the time. I wonder if I can kill a dusk blade's it. I don't know. I probably could. I should go mad
[9832.60s -> 9843.28s]  What do thing about Timo and other top one as a d carry? I play Timo a d carry when I'm playing for fun sometimes
[9844.20s -> 9855.13s]  It's okay. Yo go look on your game man
[9855.13s -> 9858.13s]  So during the mid game is Caitlyn,
[9858.13s -> 9860.13s]  a few things that I can kind of teach you.
[9860.13s -> 9862.13s]  This was kind of a boring lane phase, right?
[9862.13s -> 9864.13s]  Like, we didn't really do that much.
[9864.13s -> 9866.13s]  The lane phase was essentially just like,
[9866.13s -> 9868.13s]  we died once and then, you know, everything,
[9868.13s -> 9870.13s]  all hell broke loose.
[9870.13s -> 9872.13s]  When you're walk up the fights like this,
[9872.13s -> 9875.13s]  make sure that you're putting traps down in places
[9875.13s -> 9878.64s]  where the enemy has to walk.
[9878.64s -> 9885.92s]  Just like that.
[9885.92s -> 9888.92s]  Playing, playing Caitlyn is not always about just like autoing
[9888.92s -> 9889.92s]  and getting cues and shits.
[9889.92s -> 9897.60s]  If you noticed during that fight I put two traps here two traps here. I forced the enemy team into like a location where they had to eat traps
[9898.32s -> 9901.47s]  or they
[9901.47s -> 9904.11s]  They can't find us, right and even if like
[9907.06s -> 9912.78s]  They've void the traps. They're still having to like move their character in a very unique specific way that they
[9913.18s -> 9914.86s]  Probably don't want to do
[9914.86s -> 9922.73s]  So you should always be thinking where should I put these traps down at the start of bite not like how do I get autos off?
[9922.89s -> 9924.89s]  Think about using your traps to zone and
[9924.89s -> 9928.33s]  And that I control the team fight before the fight starts rather than using it to
[9929.61s -> 9932.89s]  Do damage because that they'll step in the traps themselves
[9933.89s -> 9939.53s]  People will just people are stupid. They're bad people are paying attention everything I'm bad
[9940.61s -> 9945.01s]  You know what I mean people can't pay attention to every bush that you're putting traps in during a big fight
[9945.01s -> 9962.07s]  It's it's too much attention span nobody has it nice
[9964.24s -> 9970.03s]  Grab this run. Oh big tip for all the 80 carries in chat guys
[9970.99s -> 9976.99s]  I'm going to tell you right now, once the 20 minute mark happens in league, your junglers camps are no longer his.
[9977.99s -> 9984.99s]  I know. I know junglers are going to hate me for this, okay? Listen, if you're a jungle player, you're like fuck this guy now. I hate him. Listen, you know it's true.
[9984.99s -> 9993.99s]  You know at 20 minutes, your camps no longer, like they're not yours any more men, okay? Like you are full items at this point, okay?
[9993.99s -> 10002.88s]  like I want to be honest you would I'm taking your camps. I'm trying to get my third item is fast as humanly possible
[10010.45s -> 10023.65s]  because 80 carriers spike on three items extremely hard and I want to walk top but we have no vision of this area
[10023.65s -> 10030.74s]  So it's a little scary like I said I typically don't like to take
[10031.54s -> 10033.30s]  jungles camps early game ever
[10034.26s -> 10039.06s]  because like that's why I say like at 20 minutes usually you have two items at this point
[10039.06s -> 10045.96s]  If you're like farming decent and you know, et cetera, sometimes it'll be faster, but usually it's around average of like you'll have your items at this point
[10048.63s -> 10074.60s]  Always be tabbing to the team fights even if you're farming as well. Zed is in this bush
[10079.32s -> 10081.72s]  Okay, where is he? Wait, I'm stupid. Where do you go? Oh
[10082.72s -> 10087.00s]  He died. I killed him. Wow, I'm really smart. I
[10093.09s -> 10095.09s]  Like didn't notice that I killed that guy. I
[10096.25s -> 10097.61s]  I'm so dumb
[10097.61s -> 10111.24s]  80 carry brand right boys. I was like playing that so scared too cuz I was like I was like is he there?
[10112.52s -> 10123.00s]  Pull the dragon out
[10123.84s -> 10128.50s]  Oh, I says yes, but what do you guys think the cool is looking dragon is I swear it's the
[10130.12s -> 10131.80s]  I think mountain Drake looks fucking sick
[10168.60s -> 10171.76s]  Welcome to the area. You saw that I like time to push man, right?
[10171.76s -> 10173.76s]  Jera hype.
[10173.76s -> 10178.92s]  That's mainly because we our karma just got picked off.
[10178.92s -> 10182.32s]  And I don't want to give them the option of pushing the wave.
[10182.32s -> 10204.02s]  So by pushing the lane, nice.
[10204.02s -> 10208.54s]  By pushing the lane in, it takes away an option for the enemy.
[10208.54s -> 10210.74s]  That's something that a lot of people think, like, oh, I just want farm.
[10210.74s -> 10212.06s]  I don't care about the farm, right?
[10212.06s -> 10215.78s]  Like, when I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game,
[10215.78s -> 10218.04s]  and I'm pushing like a mid, mid, mid,
[10218.04s -> 10223.96s]  before a fight. If we're just seeding around the barren, having that wave pushed in, gives
[10223.96s -> 10228.44s]  them, gives us another option unlike what we can do in the game. And it takes you three
[10228.44s -> 10235.48s]  seconds to push in. So, if the fights are already over and you have time, always be paying
[10235.48s -> 10240.84s]  attention to like trying to push in waves so that you can create a little bit of that pressure.
[10240.84s -> 10245.64s]  Yo, hail, thank you so much for the 14 man, walk it back. What do I get next? I kind of want to
[10245.64s -> 10255.21s]  get BT. I'm gonna be a BT. I could get Dom's, but I think BT's better because the
[10255.21s -> 10260.01s]  I already have over here, right? So the shield from BT plus shield vote plus I, I don't think
[10260.01s -> 10266.57s]  I'll be able to die. I think I'm unkillable. Act actually, actually unkillable. So here,
[10266.57s -> 10269.61s]  I'm gonna actually give these camps the federal because he's literally pathing to them and I want
[10269.61s -> 10292.20s]  to be an asshole, but wow. What just happened? I'm bad. I feel like I got hooked
[10292.20s -> 10297.20s]  Oh, he flashed, okay.
[10297.20s -> 10302.20s]  I was like, I feel like what just happened was like, I missed position, because I went up here, right?
[10302.20s -> 10305.20s]  Like I ghosted one up here, because there was two people here, two people here.
[10305.20s -> 10307.20s]  I put traps down, these kind of sloppy traps.
[10307.20s -> 10312.20s]  And then I positioned here, and then clad flashed, queued me under the, yeah, okay, that makes sense.
[10312.20s -> 10313.20s]  I'm just bad.
[10313.20s -> 10321.85s]  Here's okay, though, because if the entire enemy team has to literally,
[10321.85s -> 10329.37s]  literally my double flash on you to kill you into the turret and then your team follows up
[10329.37s -> 10332.89s]  it's not that big of a deal. Gail Force would have saved me there though actually.
[10334.57s -> 10343.06s]  Okay, Gail Force totally would have saved me. Because he has Serpent's
[10345.77s -> 10350.17s]  Serpent's definitely shits on Chobo. I'm kind of stupid for going to Chobo this game.
[10353.13s -> 10356.17s]  I wanted to try it out because I went up before when I was playing Caitlyn,
[10356.17s -> 10358.17s]  Before the IE, you're working everything.
[10358.17s -> 10360.17s]  Everybody would go,
[10360.17s -> 10364.17s]  or there was like one guy in Challenger would go shield bow into shit every game.
[10364.17s -> 10366.17s]  And I wanted to see if like, it was still liable,
[10366.17s -> 10368.17s]  but there might just be better options,
[10368.17s -> 10374.46s]  not like always scale 4 set of BT or something.
[10374.46s -> 10379.61s]  Oh my god, I flashed late. I'm dead.
[10379.61s -> 10381.61s]  Dude, I flashed late for some reason.
[10381.61s -> 10383.61s]  I'm so dumb.
[10383.61s -> 10385.61s]  My bad.
[10385.61s -> 10387.61s]  I was giving an M.B.
[10387.61s -> 10389.61s]  Like my brain is moving slowly.
[10389.61s -> 10396.33s]  like I can feel it turning I'm just playing bad like I was baiting the
[10396.33s -> 10399.51s]  clad to to go in on me because karma was there but what I need to do is
[10399.51s -> 10404.25s]  I need to trap on top myself when he goes in then I need to flash net and the
[10404.25s -> 10412.14s]  clad just does you can also just kill him I was gonna say they have
[10412.14s -> 10423.94s]  nothing we just play for dragon here I don't know why I'm playing so bad today I
[10423.94s -> 10425.94s]  I play bad yesterday too. I don't know what's going on.
[10425.94s -> 10427.94s]  I like brain is broken.
[10427.94s -> 10459.23s]  Dude, there were convestrags so hard.
[10459.23s -> 10487.49s]  Oh, I've made so many mistakes this game.
[10487.49s -> 10492.49s]  I fucked up positioning mechanic, farm, all kinds of shit.
[10492.49s -> 10508.39s]  Ah, I still don't want our domes actually.
[10508.39s -> 10510.39s]  I don't think our domes is good this game.
[10510.39s -> 10513.83s]  Like, they have no armor.
[10513.83s -> 10516.83s]  Like, clad has mercreds.
[10516.83s -> 10518.83s]  Which I feel like it's
[10519.79s -> 10521.79s]  Really bad indoor team, but oh
[10531.34s -> 10534.94s]  A little tip that you guys can have for Caitlin too when you are
[10536.02s -> 10543.38s]  Like barren's up in 50 seconds, all right, so a little thing you can do that's actually kind of fun is you want to be at the objective before the like
[10543.82s -> 10548.30s]  Rule with them one of the objectives coming up you always want to be on that side of the map before the before the objective comes up
[10549.18s -> 10554.78s]  But you can put down traps in the bushes
[10555.38s -> 10559.38s]  around the objectives and people will face check them and you can just one tap on my game
[10561.38s -> 10563.38s]  it's actually incredibly fun
[10563.38s -> 10576.02s]  but you just put them in the corners of the bushes where people have to walk
[10576.02s -> 10578.02s]  like right here I can put it right between the turret
[10578.02s -> 10591.06s]  I don't know why I didn't ghost
[10591.06s -> 10594.06s]  I'll be honest I have no idea why I didn't ghost
[10594.06s -> 10599.39s]  I was like saving it for something I'm not sure what
[10599.39s -> 10603.15s]  next year a birthday present
[10603.15s -> 10605.15s]  you put the fuck nose
[10605.15s -> 10613.06s]  I could have one shot that guy if I was better at Kate.
[10613.06s -> 10615.06s]  I did a really classic combo right there.
[10615.06s -> 10618.44s]  I just didn't cue because I'm bad.
[10618.44s -> 10621.44s]  I should have, when he hit the trap, your two headshots sit on him for a few seconds.
[10621.44s -> 10624.44s]  So what I should have done is I should have instantly cueed on top of the trap,
[10624.44s -> 10626.44s]  then auto auto, and he would have died.
[10626.44s -> 10628.44s]  Because your cue does the max damage when they're trapped too.
[10628.44s -> 10631.44s]  So it would have been like just a perfect three shot.
[10631.44s -> 10636.44s]  But I said, I don't play Kate enough, and my muscle memory is kind of trash sometimes.
[10636.44s -> 10638.44s]  So that's my bad.
[10638.44s -> 10651.16s]  Oh, we're getting clotted.
[10651.96s -> 10672.02s]  I don't know where he is, but I shouldn't have done that.
[10674.91s -> 10676.91s]  I'm women testing really hard right now.
[10676.91s -> 10678.91s]  I suggest you guys don't limit test.
[10678.91s -> 10680.91s]  Well, I do think you should limit test.
[10680.91s -> 10682.91s]  But not if you want to win, like play safer.
[10682.91s -> 10684.91s]  Like right there, the play wasn't to go back in.
[10684.91s -> 10687.91s]  The play was to like back off, but I wanted to see if I could like...
[10687.91s -> 10692.86s]  I wanted to see if I was terrible or not.
[10692.86s -> 10694.86s]  You know?
[10694.86s -> 10696.86s]  I was.
[10696.86s -> 10698.86s]  But yeah, I mean, the combo with Kate is like,
[10698.86s -> 10705.34s]  is like, if they're trapped, you want to queue while they're in the trap, essentially, because
[10705.34s -> 10712.46s]  your auto will always give you the range. So if you auto and then queue, when they're trapped,
[10712.46s -> 10716.86s]  they get, not a lot of people know this, because I just found this out, like, a few years,
[10716.86s -> 10724.54s]  or like, after I should have, when you queue on top of a K-trap, the way K-t's queue works is when
[10724.54s -> 10727.38s]  when you queue, the initial like it hits initially
[10727.38s -> 10730.62s]  and then it does less damage to the target's behind it, right?
[10730.62s -> 10732.66s]  It's very narrow and then it gets bigger.
[10732.66s -> 10735.78s]  So when they're trapped though,
[10735.78s -> 10738.10s]  it does the maximum queue damage that it can do
[10738.10s -> 10739.94s]  in like the isolation of the queue.
[10739.94s -> 10741.82s]  So that's why when people are trapped,
[10741.82s -> 10745.49s]  you wanna open up with your queue.
[10745.49s -> 10747.77s]  You either wanna net into the queue
[10747.77s -> 10750.57s]  and then double auto or you wanna net
[10750.57s -> 10753.05s]  or you wanna like you wanna queue,
[10753.05s -> 10756.37s]  then trap net at the same time, then double auto.
[10756.37s -> 10759.21s]  You basically, it's a very interesting way to play.
[10759.21s -> 10762.01s]  You always want to try and overlay a trap on your trap.
[10762.01s -> 10765.17s]  So when they get trapped, you can overlay a second trap
[10765.17s -> 10767.85s]  to either in front of them or behind them.
[10767.85s -> 10769.37s]  And what'll happen is there's actually
[10769.37s -> 10772.93s]  like a little mini, like I want to say one second cool down
[10772.93s -> 10774.05s]  of being able to be trapped, right?
[10774.05s -> 10776.29s]  Like a little 1.5 to say cool down.
[10776.29s -> 10778.17s]  But what can happen is they sit in the trap,
[10778.17s -> 10780.25s]  then what you can do is your net can slow them.
[10780.25s -> 10783.05s]  So you can actually queue in the first trap,
[10783.05s -> 10784.93s]  then you can drop a second trap,
[10784.93s -> 10786.77s]  net slow them into the second trap,
[10786.77s -> 10788.89s]  and then triple auto headshot them from all three
[10788.89s -> 10791.05s]  of the net, the two traps.
[10791.05s -> 10803.45s]  It's really complicated sounding, but this man
[10803.45s -> 10806.65s]  just redeemed end to my stream whenever you want.
[10813.52s -> 10817.21s]  What?
[10817.21s -> 10822.11s]  Why?
[10822.11s -> 10829.63s]  Why would you want to end my stream, right, though?
[10829.63s -> 10838.25s]  Why would you want to be that guy?
[10838.25s -> 10850.30s]  Wow, okay.
[10850.30s -> 10853.30s]  Don't don't end, just change the camera position.
[10854.66s -> 10859.69s]  Did you just spend one million points
[10859.69s -> 10863.89s]  to tell me to put the camera back on the right side of my bucket?
[10869.22s -> 10870.62s]  No way.
[10872.10s -> 10878.18s]  No way, you just did that.
[10878.18s -> 10881.26s]  I was like, this man is just flexing.
[10881.26s -> 10883.90s]  He's just like, yeah, I got some points to spare.
[10883.90s -> 10885.62s]  I guess I could like throw him, you know,
[10885.62s -> 10901.99s]  eh, all right, fun.
[10901.99s -> 10902.87s]  There's that better.
[10902.87s -> 10917.03s]  Is that better drink water actually that's a good one. I'll be right back. I'm going to get some water should we plan our main
[10917.51s -> 10919.51s]  I kind of want to try and hit GM
[10919.87s -> 10927.59s]  Yeah, let's get on our main account. It's like one PM. So it's like three PM Eastern. I think I can get queues at the moment
[10928.15s -> 10934.33s]  I'll make it some water and then we'll queue up or we'll queue up then gets water, okay?
[10934.69s -> 10946.42s]  Because I think it's light enough in the day I can get queues now without waiting 40 minutes
[10946.42s -> 10956.42s]  by the way it is it is a teaching stream when I'm doing that like
[10956.42s -> 10959.14s]  Katy Perry Academy thing so if you guys have any questions you want to ask or like
[10959.14s -> 10962.26s]  you guys gonna ignore that if you guys have any questions you want to ask
[10962.26s -> 10965.86s]  or anything like that you know if we're just chillin between games just ask
[10965.86s -> 10969.98s]  whatever you want I can answer a lot easier between games that I can't
[10969.98s -> 10973.94s]  in-game you know it's a lot easier for me to see that shit I try and answer
[10973.94s -> 10977.90s]  in-game but like sometimes I'm like focusing in shit so it's a little harder I
[10977.90s -> 10988.21s]  I'm getting it some water though, so I'll be right back, okay?
[10989.21s -> 10991.21s]  Talk amongst yourselves.
[10991.21s -> 10995.21s]  Is Kraken trolling Kate? No, Kraken's going to Kate.
[10995.21s -> 10999.21s]  You can go cracking them to budd their stir or cracking them to IE if you really need it.
[10999.21s -> 11003.21s]  If they have like tanks, say they have like, sci-on,
[11003.21s -> 11007.21s]  so 20 stuff like that, that you have to like, you're the only damage,
[11007.21s -> 11010.21s]  so say you're like the only tank killer on the team, you're the only 80 damage.
[11010.21s -> 11072.21s]  You have to go cracking sometimes.
[11072.21s -> 11075.57s]  but
[11075.57s -> 11080.45s]  bursteremondo
[11081.17s -> 11107.95s]  um
[11107.95s -> 11146.64s]  The
[11165.06s -> 11191.10s]  Oh, I just sat down.
[11191.10s -> 11197.74s]  Swate.
[11197.74s -> 11199.74s]  Swate.
[11199.74s -> 11201.10s]  Oh, I just sat back down.
[11201.10s -> 11203.10s]  I was like, oh, yeah.
[11203.10s -> 11204.10s]  Let's go.
[11204.10s -> 11205.10s]  Keep up.
[11205.10s -> 11207.10s]  Oh, somebody declined it.
[11207.10s -> 11208.10s]  Fuck.
[11208.10s -> 11210.02s]  All right, boys.
[11210.02s -> 11220.80s]  Let's go. I got I got so many things in front of me right now. I got water. I got fucking
[11222.04s -> 11240.39s]  Rice cake. You also have with my hair today with the fuck. There we go
[11249.74s -> 11268.16s]  All right, boys. What are we playing? I don't really care about manning you me most of the time, but we'll just do it
[11268.56s -> 11281.28s]  I don't remember we're talking about all supports. Yeah, they're all stupid
[11285.40s -> 11288.64s]  Sky oh that's so good that's so good
[11300.38s -> 11302.30s]  Oh, what am I playing?
[11302.30s -> 11306.10s]  Or vice-verace?
[11306.10s -> 11314.14s]  Hmm.
[11314.14s -> 11317.38s]  Let me just play Jink's Millio.
[11317.38s -> 11318.22s]  Jink's Millio?
[11318.22s -> 11319.94s]  Pretty, pretty gross land.
[11319.94s -> 11329.50s]  Pretty gross land.
[11329.50s -> 11335.65s]  Um, Kaisa, I didn't want to pick Kaisa in the veris.
[11335.65s -> 11338.61s]  I could have picked Kaisa this game, but I kind of wanted to pick Jink's, because
[11338.61s -> 11347.75s]  Millio Jink's is really good, it's like a super, super OP land.
[11347.75s -> 11348.75s]  Somebody dodged.
[11348.75s -> 11349.75s]  Okay.
[11349.75s -> 11361.28s]  Take this out.
[11361.28s -> 11362.28s]  Oh, support.
[11362.28s -> 11363.28s]  Yeah, they're all stupid.
[11363.28s -> 11383.72s]  I mean, listen, every 80 carries default state of mind. Listen, I'm not wrong. I ain't wrong.
[11383.72s -> 11394.18s]  I need to see if this guy is the Pike player or not before I ban this because like I don't want to play versus Pike, usually Pike's are all like one tricks and shit.
[11394.18s -> 11403.90s]  I don't want to play versus Pike player, but I needed to know that my support wasn't the Pike player, you know? He doesn't seem to care.
[11403.90s -> 11420.94s]  the car. Ash Amelia was really good too. Yeah. No Ash Amelia was really good. So tragedy.
[11430.51s -> 11434.67s]  Dude, I always have to first pick. Every game. Every game I have to first pick. Every single one.
[11449.36s -> 11476.29s]  You're not liking the camera over there? No. My bad. Can we revert it with points?
[11478.98s -> 11490.02s]  Are you motherfuckers trying to like bid war to where my camera is right now? Is that what's happening?
[11504.77s -> 11512.27s]  You're what's interesting. I don't know what someone want to take here.
[11514.35s -> 11522.03s]  I almost want to take cleanse because they have a failure skew, we'll lose slow, we'll
[11522.03s -> 11527.81s]  lose CC, a heck of a fear, and areial, I mean, areage arm.
[11527.81s -> 11530.81s]  But every single one of those is avoidable if I'm not bad.
[11530.81s -> 11538.17s]  It's hard to tell because like every single one of those things is like avoidable if
[11538.17s -> 11542.24s]  I'm not trash at the game.
[11542.24s -> 11551.38s]  So it's like you would be to speak and cleanse for like, uh, but you do take away a lot of
[11551.38s -> 11559.80s]  their ability to kill you if you take cleanse.
[11559.80s -> 11561.80s]  Wow.
[11561.80s -> 11567.25s]  Hmm.
[11567.25s -> 11568.45s]  I'm going to greed.
[11568.45s -> 11570.65s]  I might regret this though.
[11570.65s -> 11573.69s]  Like my gut is telling me to take cleanse.
[11573.69s -> 11587.54s]  Because if I take cleanser, they only have one way to kill me.
[11587.54s -> 11589.50s]  Oh, look guys.
[11589.50s -> 11590.14s]  It's 20.
[11590.14s -> 11591.90s]  Yo, it's $1 to think.
[11591.90s -> 11595.16s]  No, it's the fake stylish.
[11595.16s -> 11596.36s]  What isn't 21 stylus?
[11596.36s -> 11600.17s]  The fake stylish?
[11600.17s -> 11601.45s]  Is that the real one or the fake one?
[11601.45s -> 11602.61s]  There's like a fake one out there.
[11602.61s -> 11608.74s]  And I don't know if that's the real one or the fake one.
[11608.74s -> 11646.68s]  Oh, a silence? No, what reverse again? I'll take one, one, three. We'll take one, three this game, just because um,
[11654.50s -> 11674.63s]  warm up a bit. I actually like long three more against double rands because you can't get poked out. Why don't you like go so real. I do like ghost.
[11676.63s -> 11679.63s]  This game particularly, I don't think ghost has more value though.
[11679.63s -> 11681.63s]  because
[11681.63s -> 11685.63s]  the only like ghost is really good against triple melee
[11685.63s -> 11690.78s]  or I've like ghost a lot against triple melee jumps
[11690.78s -> 11691.78s]  or cumps
[11691.78s -> 11693.78s]  but there's only two melee's
[11693.78s -> 11695.78s]  and one of them I don't even consider Hackerma melee
[11695.78s -> 11698.78s]  Hackerma's like a fucking
[11698.78s -> 11700.78s]  you'd mother fucker
[11700.78s -> 11705.62s]  Hackerma's like an assassin
[11705.62s -> 11722.57s]  you know what's interesting
[11722.57s -> 11725.57s]  this literally is bullying the fuck out of us
[11725.57s -> 11729.46s]  and trying to get level two
[11729.46s -> 11747.36s]  level 2. So I think one of them has, we could, we could just double E that guy. Why would
[11747.36s -> 11768.21s]  you do that? I'm confused as to like, what's happening here? Why aren't we fighting these guys?
[11770.45s -> 11777.33s]  This, this, this, this, this, uh, Serfine's trolling. So all she had to do there was double E. That's
[11777.33s -> 11781.01s]  it. If she double E either of them, they instantly die because we have healed, they don't have
[11781.01s -> 11786.25s]  And we have exhaust. They've they've ghost so all you have to do to win that is double e
[11786.53s -> 11794.70s]  Walk up exhaust their failures and we win like he dies. I'm impressed that this guy's I
[11795.90s -> 11797.90s]  Don't want to be mean. Everyone I
[11799.50s -> 11801.50s]  There's no reason to be mean
[11801.82s -> 11805.02s]  Maybe he just doesn't play surfing that much
[11805.82s -> 11811.60s]  I mean yeah, he like the surfing should be walking up right now. You see how like far back she is
[11811.60s -> 11827.44s]  I can't walk up like at the moment. I just can't. That was a good fucking juke. I
[11829.44s -> 11834.96s]  Really want to push this. Oh my
[11835.66s -> 11840.06s]  Stylishing god
[11840.06s -> 11842.06s]  Because that was just kind of a god
[11846.54s -> 11847.94s]  Yeah
[11847.94s -> 11849.94s]  What the fuck. That was insane
[11851.22s -> 11853.22s]  My man's fucking smurfing
[11856.05s -> 11858.05s]  Jesus
[11858.05s -> 11862.64s]  Like that was dirty
[11862.64s -> 11888.16s]  Guys nuts
[11888.16s -> 11898.82s]  I didn't put any points in my E because when we were in the lane, I didn't have enough, uh, uh, I didn't have enough mana to use E anyway.
[11898.82s -> 11901.82s]  So there was no real point to put it in there at the time.
[11901.82s -> 11919.90s]  I kind of wish I had E now, but, oh, that was a misposition. Jesus.
[11919.90s -> 11924.98s]  I'm just off today. I don't know why.
[11924.98s -> 11927.98s]  I don't need to push this. I can just let it sit.
[11927.98s -> 11932.98s]  I thinned it a tiny bit. Now what we can do here is we just want it to sit there.
[11932.98s -> 11941.73s]  The Feliost can't walk up. Now I would want the seraphine to be like in the bush over there like like up a bit right
[11942.23s -> 11946.71s]  Because if she stands in that bush, a Feliost can't walk up whereas if she's behind me
[11947.35s -> 11949.83s]  A Feliost can walk up standing that bush and soak XP
[11950.23s -> 11959.06s]  So stopping the XP soak is very important. I need to run to this fight. I think the fight's over already
[11959.06s -> 11984.24s]  I think my team troll, but I'm still gonna run to it. Not bad. Nice. So I'm very low right now
[11984.84s -> 11989.60s]  Um, I think the only thing to do is actually just the back so the way the wave is set up right now
[11989.60s -> 11995.60s]  I Can't push it before they get back to land. It will like slow push towards them
[11996.44s -> 11998.44s]  But I don't think I have a choice
[11999.72s -> 12002.76s]  I'd have to this is something that I'm actually at F to actually rewatch
[12003.64s -> 12005.64s]  I know I think it's actually frozen
[12006.32s -> 12009.04s]  But I think maybe I should have cleared one minion maybe two
[12009.88s -> 12016.65s]  So that it doesn't like crash it stays frozen unless I did it correctly
[12017.05s -> 12022.05s]  I think I did it right, yeah, I did, okay, that one.
[12022.05s -> 12025.05s]  I thought I was like overthinking it.
[12025.05s -> 12041.58s]  Boy thing about Ghost instead of healing jinks, I think it's great.
[12041.58s -> 12045.58s]  Like I said, um, this game specifically, I think he'll has more value,
[12045.58s -> 12049.58s]  but I think in a lot of games, Ghost is very good.
[12049.58s -> 12053.58s]  Ghost is good on Ash, good on Jinks, good on a failure,
[12053.58s -> 12055.58s]  Xary, like 80 carries at the moment.
[12055.58s -> 12060.06s]  I'm curious at the moment that Ghost Metas really good because there's a really heavy tank
[12060.06s -> 12062.06s]  bruiser meta going on right?
[12062.06s -> 12066.62s]  Coupled with like an enchantery meta or like a bot lane where it's like a bunch of
[12066.62s -> 12070.30s]  melee's I suck Jesus and because of that I think it's actually
[12072.30s -> 12076.46s]  Ghost is super good. I just this game. There's only two melee's in enemy team and
[12080.24s -> 12083.20s]  I didn't want to just farm lane this. I wanted to be able to fight early.
[12083.20s -> 12088.20s]  the
[12088.20s -> 12090.20s]  well, okay, so the reason you take ghosts is because you farmland
[12090.20s -> 12094.20s]  you're not looking to fight early when you take ghost that's the whole point of ghost
[12094.20s -> 12097.20s]  it's a scaling, it's a hundred percent of scaling,
[12097.20s -> 12103.20s]  so if you're playing in lower elo and you, you know, you want to take ghost, you want to try it out
[12103.20s -> 12107.20s]  just realize that like you are trying to scale
[12107.20s -> 12109.76s]  Oh, somebody AFKed.
[12109.76s -> 12117.23s]  Ah, okay, that's cringe.
[12117.23s -> 12121.63s]  Like, if you're in, say you're in like gold silver plat, whatever you owe you're in,
[12121.63s -> 12124.63s]  that's like, you deemed us like, you know, a bit of the lower e-lose.
[12124.63s -> 12127.63s]  I don't even think plat's that way, but a gold and silver red.
[12127.63s -> 12132.63s]  Um, because gold is average, so it's like not even low, typically, but everybody says it's low.
[12132.63s -> 12138.43s]  Uh, if you, if you take ghost, just understand that you are playing for mid game.
[12138.43s -> 12141.03s]  Bronze? Still, you're playing for mid game, yeah.
[12141.03s -> 12153.37s]  Goes this fun. I would take personally. I would probably take heal in bronze, just because I think you can take advantage of lane phase really hard in bronze.
[12153.37s -> 12167.37s]  Like bronze is a lot to me is like, I should have reported that guy. I am stupid. Bronze is like, you can learn how to abuse people's lane phase really hard, like people will fight a lot in bronze, right?
[12167.37s -> 12172.33s]  They will take bad trades or they will like try and fight because they don't know typically if you're bronze
[12172.33s -> 12176.33s]  You probably don't know like the champions very well in the damage stuff and stuff like that
[12176.61s -> 12185.26s]  So what ends of happening is like you probably just die a bunch or they're probably a lot of deaths and bronze so I would say
[12186.66s -> 12192.42s]  Playing to like be able to help yourself early games with all the fighting going on is gonna have a lot more value than ghost
[12192.42s -> 12198.90s]  Ghost. Ghost is more of like a, oh, we hit mid game or a giant fight broke out and I
[12198.90s -> 12203.86s]  can like, it's an extended long fight and I can get Ghost utilization. Also, Ghost is really
[12203.86s -> 12208.58s]  valuable when you have good mechanical skill. Well, Ghost requires very good positioning typically
[12209.14s -> 12212.74s]  because you're repositioning a lot in the fight and that's why Ghost is so good because you
[12212.74s -> 12219.38s]  can reposition back for, back for, back for, and you can essentially like space the enemy and get
[12219.38s -> 12228.35s]  free damage. Free boots do. Depends on the champion and the matchup. Like, if I'm playing
[12228.35s -> 12233.71s]  jinx and I'm playing into like, I don't know, let's say I'm playing into like, I saw a little
[12233.71s -> 12238.51s]  loop. Okay. You can take free boots. You don't need early boots in that matchup because it's
[12238.51s -> 12244.11s]  an a chance or farm 80 carry versus an a chance or farm 80 carry. Okay. Now, if I'm versus, let's
[12244.11s -> 12248.67s]  say I'm versus like a blitz crank. Let's say I'm playing jinx and I'm versus blitz. Like, I typically
[12248.67s -> 12251.63s]  don't want to have to wait for nine minutes to get boots because Blitzcrank's gonna
[12251.63s -> 12257.47s]  shit on me. So I will take different runes versus that Blitzcrank to allow myself
[12258.59s -> 12262.91s]  the option of like let's say I have 1100 gold and I back I can get early boots and now
[12264.03s -> 12272.51s]  the Blitzcrank has a much harder time. Do you know I almost want to ban Zed because I don't
[12272.51s -> 12277.95s]  want to get shit on by stylish but I think it's cringe. I don't want to like ban stylish out.
[12277.95s -> 12297.24s]  I loved it as ADK or a bodyplate parallel to your sport.
[12297.24s -> 12299.24s]  You try to always.
[12299.24s -> 12304.87s]  Essentially, the perfect way to play bot win is your both hitting one target.
[12304.87s -> 12307.87s]  At the same time, trading on one target at the same time,
[12307.87s -> 12309.87s]  you're making a little triangle.
[12309.87s -> 12313.87s]  You're both just standing next to each other and you're both hitting that one target, right?
[12313.87s -> 12319.31s]  That's the best way to play bot win, but it's very hard to solo queue, obviously, to do that.
[12319.31s -> 12323.26s]  But if you're going to do it, you can practice it.
[12323.26s -> 12325.26s]  Sorry, it went down there on pipe.
[12325.26s -> 12328.10s]  I'm quite eight here at two of us.
[12328.10s -> 12329.94s]  I shouldn't make one.
[12329.94s -> 12332.44s]  I have this thing where even though I'm like
[12332.44s -> 12336.58s]  a grandmaster level, I still think I suck.
[12337.58s -> 12339.10s]  I have this like really black of confidence
[12339.10s -> 12340.50s]  because I used to be challenger
[12340.50s -> 12342.42s]  and then like hearts like GM.
[12342.42s -> 12343.74s]  So I have this black of confidence
[12343.74s -> 12344.86s]  of what I'm talking about.
[12346.06s -> 12348.02s]  So like I feel like if I were to make it to your list,
[12348.02s -> 12351.78s]  it would be based on like a GM player's skill.
[12351.78s -> 12356.94s]  And I don't know if like I don't want to get ripped apart by people.
[12356.94s -> 12376.22s]  But I guess I could make a tier list from my own opinion.
[12376.22s -> 12377.82s]  Like let me see, tier list maker.
[12378.94s -> 12412.82s]  I'm sure there's a tier list maker with champions, right?
[12412.82s -> 12413.50s]  Yeah, there it is.
[12414.54s -> 12415.50s]  Wait, this is terrible.
[12415.50s -> 12423.21s]  What are these pictures?
[12423.21s -> 12424.89s]  I'm just, what is this?
[12424.89s -> 12426.21s]  What is this?
[12427.21s -> 12439.78s]  Why is Nico on here?
[12439.78s -> 12446.38s]  I wanna use this one, but this one doesn't have Xary.
[12446.38s -> 12447.90s]  I'm trying to find one with Xary on it.
[12447.90s -> 12449.10s]  There doesn't look like shit.
[12449.10s -> 12452.14s]  It says this one has Xary, but it looks like,
[12452.14s -> 12465.38s]  It looks shitty, I don't enjoy that.
[12465.38s -> 12468.38s]  Hold on, we're going to play Ash this game, because they picked his Earth.
[12468.38s -> 12472.38s]  Like I just saw him first pick Xareth, so I want something that can engage on this Earth.
[12472.38s -> 12474.38s]  So we're going to go Ash.
[12474.38s -> 12477.38s]  These are going to be my Ash runes this game boys.
[12477.38s -> 12482.67s]  So I want to go present to Minds.
[12482.67s -> 12486.39s]  I don't know.
[12486.39s -> 12492.43s]  I kind of do, but I kind of don't.
[12492.43s -> 12494.43s]  I think present to Mind kind of sucks.
[12494.43s -> 12496.43s]  It feels kind of shitty.
[12496.43s -> 12502.37s]  Hmm, I'm going to just do it overkill.
[12502.37s -> 12507.26s]  We can go lacquerity.
[12507.26s -> 12511.26s]  I probably won't go crack inside of this game, so we could probably just go lacquerity.
[12511.26s -> 12515.26s]  Even though crack inside is not bad on ash, I kind of want to go borecresh.
[12515.26s -> 12530.82s]  But I could go, I actually don't know what I want to take if I want to take borderline of our lacquerity.
[12530.82s -> 12532.82s]  I'm going to take lacquerity, we'll try it out.
[12532.82s -> 12534.82s]  And then we'll do guffs.
[12534.82s -> 12535.82s]  Okay.
[12535.82s -> 12537.82s]  Was I going to say?
[12537.82s -> 12539.82s]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[12539.82s -> 12545.75s]  I need to find the right tier list.
[12545.75s -> 12547.75s]  I mean, I can just use this, right?
[12548.55s -> 12559.27s]  I can't. Where's Zary? Oh, oh, there we go.
[12560.63s -> 12568.62s]  Yeah, this is good, okay. I was like I was trying to figure it out. I was like what the fuck? I think just straight out of the gate
[12568.62s -> 12570.38s]  I was putting jinx and s here. I
[12571.50s -> 12574.78s]  Think jinx is just a nastier champion. She's crazy OP
[12576.54s -> 12581.42s]  Like jinx just does whatever champion wants to do, but like better than them. She's blind pickable
[12581.42s -> 12589.18s]  Her two item three item spike is crazy. She doesn't have a lot of like really bad matchups and Wayne phase anymore
[12589.74s -> 12592.94s]  They gave her scaling like crazy high like she's just good
[12594.34s -> 12597.04s]  Good build past six that are like it's just a good champion
[12600.01s -> 12604.93s]  I would say it's also hard to do tier list because you have to be tier list for like low-e-low and high-e-low
[12604.93s -> 12608.09s]  Right because if I'm doing like a low-e-low tier list
[12608.73s -> 12610.73s]  You're putting a math like here
[12610.73s -> 12616.73s]  right like MF super good. But if you're doing a high-yellow tier, I said MF's like here.
[12616.73s -> 12622.73s]  It's hard to explain. And like in what we love, I'm putting a list of here.
[12622.73s -> 12627.73s]  But in high-yellow, I'm putting her here. So it's really interesting.
[12627.73s -> 12635.09s]  Right? Because it's all based on like people's mechanical skill too.
[12635.09s -> 12638.09s]  But yeah, we do the tier of us between games, I guess.
[12638.09s -> 12643.09s]  So far, I think Jinks is definitely Estir. I wish there was like an S plus tier.
[12643.09s -> 12647.90s]  here, but jinx is definitely us here.
[12647.90s -> 12649.90s]  Draven's hard to choose for me.
[12649.90s -> 12651.86s]  Like I want to put him in a tier
[12651.86s -> 12653.06s]  because he has a lot of counter matchups,
[12653.06s -> 12658.84s]  but in solo queue, Draven feels insane.
[12658.84s -> 12662.36s]  So it's hard because I don't think Draven's overrated
[12662.36s -> 12666.08s]  personally because I don't have to beat Draven players,
[12666.08s -> 12668.44s]  but I also think in high elo,
[12669.44s -> 12671.80s]  when people also know how to deal with Draven players,
[12671.80s -> 12677.27s]  the game, I also do feel like,
[12677.27s -> 12681.83s]  good driving players and good people who know how to play around driving players make
[12681.83s -> 12686.11s]  driving OP, but it's also the opposite word good players you know how to play around
[12686.11s -> 12691.63s]  driving can counterpick driving and making worthless so it's really it's really hard
[12691.63s -> 12720.84s]  all right let me say Morgana versus a mou mou jim players jim players are psychopaths man
[12720.84s -> 12726.80s]  I don't think Jins very good right now. I think he could be good if they gave him like a quality life change
[12726.80s -> 12739.19s]  Is it getting buff next patch? I think he's getting buffed. I think he should do I Jins such a fun champ. He's just like a little shitty
[12749.44s -> 12757.79s]  We can actually just straight fight them right now if I'm gonna move just queues because Morana's worth a sub one
[12758.27s -> 12769.56s]  Like I actually just straight up want to fight these guys right now. Go go go
[12769.96s -> 12782.55s]  I hope he messed both his queues
[12782.55s -> 12789.13s]  Dude this guy this is a movie who's killing me man. Oh my god, I
[12791.13s -> 12796.98s]  Prow! What am I watching? What is it? What are these curious brother?
[12803.05s -> 12805.05s]  Holy shit
[12805.93s -> 12807.93s]  All right, I should have taken longsword
[12811.58s -> 12818.65s]  The movie is not feeling himself today. Let me tell you what he is not feeling himself
[12834.63s -> 12837.03s]  Chase even if as comes Chase
[12837.03s -> 12873.90s]  I don't know if we can fight this. We can try. I'll follow. I mean, they guys should die. Dude, what I don't even know what's happening right now.
[12873.90s -> 12884.81s]  This is crazy. This is ridiculous. Both Medelliners just got like three kills out of nowhere.
[12884.81s -> 12899.06s]  We went from like a ridiculously, we went from like a grandmaster game to like a diamond game.
[12899.06s -> 12906.45s]  Like somehow like the emimus like kind of with in some shit
[12907.65s -> 12912.45s]  I took a bad tread early then fucking this shit is funny as fuck
[12915.81s -> 12922.37s]  So I'm gonna I'm gonna actually rush to your two boots this game because I actually really really
[12923.81s -> 12931.41s]  Want to be mobile against their team like I'm just gonna straight up leave go buy T2 boots and that's gonna be my my power spike for Ash right now
[12931.41s -> 12937.11s]  They have so many things that I can dodge on their team like look at the shit, right?
[12937.11s -> 12942.31s]  Like more binding T2 boots super easy to dodge if you can't flash it on me, right?
[12942.31s -> 12946.95s]  Like if you can't flash melee range, then more bind it's I should never get hit by it unless I have no fingers
[12947.67s -> 12949.67s]  Ezreal Q easy to dodge
[12950.07s -> 12953.41s]  Zareth easy to dodge this guy, whatever the fuck
[12954.09s -> 12957.93s]  Cosic bugman is a melee champ, so boots have value, etc
[12957.93s -> 12972.25s]  Also, the cool thing about Boots Rush Ash is she doesn't have damage that if I'm good at spacing, like the better at spacing you are,
[12972.25s -> 12978.25s]  you can actually just one B2, especially against double skill shots like this.
[12978.25s -> 13008.09s]  It's pretty fun. Fuck, if I juked that last QO to kill that guy,
[13008.09s -> 13014.09s]  they're there to actually fucked us so bad though. That was a good fight until there it's just showed up and beat our ass.
[13014.09s -> 13032.94s]  ass. I just get the just get them anyway. It's kind of funny to watch though because I do
[13032.94s -> 13042.17s]  so little damage, but I also like just parma slow so they can't do anything about it. Hopefully
[13042.17s -> 13049.05s]  when TF gets six he can come bot and we can fuck over their bollin. I'm hoping that that's the case.
[13055.80s -> 13070.87s]  We're on a room to mid, Kazakhstan's also mid, TF did. That's a good room. I'm gonna push this so
[13070.87s -> 13073.35s]  so that maybe we can play for a dragon.
[13073.35s -> 13074.99s]  Cause they might go for a dragon here,
[13074.99s -> 13078.84s]  and I think we can stop it.
[13078.84s -> 13084.40s]  We have T-Folds.
[13084.40s -> 13088.82s]  Yep, nice.
[13088.82s -> 13089.62s]  We just leave.
[13090.66s -> 13092.38s]  We don't need to actually chase or do an increase.
[13092.38s -> 13094.06s]  We're just stopping the dragon, that's all we're doing.
[13095.46s -> 13102.41s]  Right, we don't want to give him a free drink.
[13102.41s -> 13104.01s]  See, the T-2 boots are just broken.
[13104.01s -> 13111.95s]  They're broken as shit.
[13111.95s -> 13115.11s]  Cause you can just see, like I can pretty much just,
[13115.11s -> 13119.88s]  I'm just too fast for them to deal with.
[13119.88s -> 13121.52s]  Like, look at this, it's insane.
[13121.52s -> 13136.77s]  And that's why I value like the Tier 2 boots on champions, especially like Ash where you can be extra
[13136.77s -> 13142.17s]  egregious with it, because like her slow, I imagine he's like, you know, it's the same idea as
[13142.17s -> 13143.17s]  vain, right?
[13143.17s -> 13147.53s]  When you think about it, it's like, okay, so what's really annoying trying to run away from
[13147.53s -> 13149.17s]  a vein, right?
[13149.17s -> 13153.01s]  She gets boots too, and you're like, god damn it, man, she's so fast, same thing with Ash,
[13153.01s -> 13155.33s]  oh, we now you're slow.
[13155.33s -> 13156.33s]  So it's even more annoying.
[13156.33s -> 13159.49s]  You try and go in on her, she just spaces you, walks away a bit.
[13159.49s -> 13163.33s]  you're just sitting there, watering towards her solo way, just upset, tilted, frustrated.
[13164.69s -> 13190.62s]  You know, that's like your middle school dance. You know what? I think it's actually a shield
[13190.62s -> 13198.70s]  bogeam. It is. I was gonna go Bork, but I think this is a shield bogeam. It could be a
[13198.70s -> 13205.74s]  gale force game too, both both are both are viable. But I actually, I might be one of the, I might be
[13205.74s -> 13210.86s]  in the minority here with this. I think Bork Rush on Ash is actually good sometimes.
[13212.30s -> 13216.38s]  Like I think if I was versus some tanks, like you know like a sion or something like that,
[13216.38s -> 13221.50s]  I actually think Bork Rush on Ash is kind of cracked. Like yeah it stalls out like you make the
[13221.50s -> 13226.62s]  argument like it stalls out your three item or your two item, but it feels kind of nuts.
[13227.90s -> 13232.54s]  Also this is a really OP thing that you can do. I should have hawkshot it sooner. I knew that they were
[13232.54s -> 13237.58s]  We're doing uh, rift, but I'm not paying attention as much as I should be.
[13237.58s -> 13247.63s]  So, because what you can do is you can, uh, hockshot to tell your team where the enemy
[13247.63s -> 13249.63s]  junglers and get information yourself.
[13249.63s -> 13257.71s]  I mean, this Morgana is a little five.
[13257.71s -> 13261.11s]  We could fight just because Morgana is five right now.
[13261.11s -> 13268.66s]  Uh, I kind of want to try.
[13268.66s -> 13271.90s]  Uh, my move didn't want to go in.
[13271.90s -> 13275.69s]  Bye, bad.
[13275.69s -> 13276.69s]  I'm a little sad.
[13276.69s -> 13277.69s]  I'm not gonna lie.
[13277.69s -> 13282.09s]  I do feel like we win these fights, but I'm gonna move on to the wait for six
[13282.73s -> 13288.33s]  Which is fine, but like I said you guys know me. I like to actually fight and be active in the lane early
[13288.89s -> 13290.89s]  Because I know that we can fight, right?
[13292.01s -> 13304.57s]  And so it's like obviously, you know, ooh, this is really rough
[13305.93s -> 13307.93s]  I can't do anything
[13307.93s -> 13311.50s]  Because there it's here
[13311.50s -> 13317.50s]  TF's coming with Alt, though. I don't have Alt's, damn it, if I had Alt, this would be so god tier.
[13317.50s -> 13323.13s]  God, you have no idea how OP this would be if I had Alt's, man.
[13323.13s -> 13330.14s]  Whenever I'm bad, I want to push this way though, so I'm assuming they're all backing.
[13330.14s -> 13337.14s]  I think we've penned out there with Alt. We even killed the top laner. Oh, I'm bad. Why did I stay?
[13337.14s -> 13343.14s]  I knew Cosics would do that. I have to retrain my brain. Cosics players are rats.
[13343.14s -> 13346.90s]  And I have to retrain my brand uh, remember that they will sit in a bush for 30 minutes,
[13346.90s -> 13349.22s]  lose all of their farm to get one kill.
[13350.26s -> 13351.46s]  I like always forget that.
[13355.32s -> 13357.56s]  Like, cause expires are absolute fucking rats.
[13361.70s -> 13364.02s]  Like, I respect to rank our players more than cause expires.
[13364.02s -> 13366.98s]  Yeah, I said it. I know. Hot take, I know.
[13367.54s -> 13373.11s]  But I do. I'm gonna try an arrow right here.
[13377.24s -> 13381.82s]  Got him. You know that guy's pissed by the way.
[13381.82s -> 13394.46s]  that damn it he's gonna try and ult me from the bush you can always tell that you're
[13394.46s -> 13399.34s]  about to get ulted when an Ezreal big big tip for you guys if an Ezreal ever walks out
[13399.34s -> 13405.58s]  of vision expect that he's ulting you I you would not believe you would not believe
[13405.58s -> 13409.70s]  the amount of people that I kill with Ezreal by simply walking into a bush and ulting
[13409.70s -> 13416.90s]  them and they forget that I exist I'm not I'm not even it happens so often they're just
[13416.90s -> 13421.66s]  like oh yeah he went in the bush he's gonna hit his old key like it is
[13421.66s -> 13425.90s]  comical how often happens and I'm sure you guys have died to it too
[13425.90s -> 13430.46s]  because it's like a thing where like you never see it you barely you don't see
[13430.46s -> 13433.94s]  as real that often right so because you probably don't see as real too often
[13433.94s -> 13444.92s]  you're always like oh interesting type shit I'm gonna grab this play it
[13444.92s -> 13449.60s]  and then I'm gonna back up cause it's coming down here so I'm gonna back the
[13449.60s -> 13456.16s]  fuck up. So I don't have arrow for 20. Ezreal has tri-force. We need to back up a bit.
[13459.72s -> 13463.88s]  We might have to give dragon. I could see giving dragon being okay though. It's not that bad.
[13472.58s -> 13477.54s]  Yeah, it's not it's not the worst to give drake here. I could even back so we don't get dove.
[13479.38s -> 13487.22s]  But if we back now we might lose bot turret but I can't walk up. Yeah, that's what I didn't want to have
[13487.22s -> 13501.43s]  happen. See that's I'm telling you bad rats absolute rats cause expires a
[13501.43s -> 13524.18s]  rats man absolute literal rats oh that's classy that's a good dodge I can't
[13524.18s -> 13532.46s]  even walk up but I can wait for the turret but I can't walk up I'll just die that's
[13532.46s -> 13536.18s]  another thing you have to just accept like I'm down 40 CS this game because we've
[13536.18s -> 13543.18s]  just been getting weeks out of it and we've also been getting like a move is not very good.
[13543.18s -> 13550.18s]  I don't have a better way to say it. I don't have like a nice way to say it. He's not having a good game.
[13550.18s -> 13554.18s]  And when your support does not have a good game, you don't have a good game early.
[13554.18s -> 13561.18s]  So the best thing you can do is just try and farm up what you can, don't die and scale from it.
[13561.18s -> 13565.49s]  It's all you can really do.
[13565.49s -> 13570.13s]  That's an AD carry when you're support sucks. It feels really bad, but
[13571.61s -> 13573.61s]  Sometimes you just gotta accept it, right?
[13581.63s -> 13584.79s]  This says rules not bad, but he's not good either. Oh
[13585.79s -> 13606.09s]  This guy's gonna try to help me. I'm an old kill rancher. Nice. I don't have all up yet, guys
[13606.09s -> 13609.55s]  I don't have all up yet. I can't hold you. I
[13610.69s -> 13617.80s]  Have old now, but we need to bait them in a bit. I don't even want to use my old right now to be honest with you
[13619.24s -> 13621.24s]  like I really don't.
[13622.24s -> 13626.24s]  You know what's funny that Zaris actually pretty good. I've played against them a few times in the past few seasons.
[13626.24s -> 13630.24s]  He's actually not bad. He used to be a support main.
[13631.24s -> 13637.57s]  He plays Zaris support. That's why I recognize his name.
[13637.57s -> 13646.79s]  We should not go for this refs.
[13646.79s -> 13648.79s]  I'm on a bad timer for this.
[13649.79s -> 13652.79s]  Because I'm really a well HP and mana.
[13652.79s -> 13660.71s]  Ooh, I don't have mana.
[13660.71s -> 13674.84s]  to arrow here guys. I do not want to arrow that because the the fewer I can totally the
[13674.84s -> 13684.28s]  fewer can do whatever it's called and the fewer I can what's it whatever it's called
[13684.28s -> 13689.96s]  the w it if she's fast enough and I didn't want to get my team killed. The real issue here
[13689.96s -> 13696.32s]  is that we're forcing okay I'll tell you exactly what the real issue is we're forcing too
[13696.32s -> 13700.60s]  many fights for no reason right now. So we're all forcing tons of fights at the moment
[13700.60s -> 13703.60s]  But there's no reason for us to force these fights.
[13703.60s -> 13707.10s]  That's why my team's getting tilted, right?
[13707.10s -> 13712.60s]  Like, for some reason, the Amumu and the TF are both just like inting.
[13712.60s -> 13713.60s]  And they're both getting frustrated.
[13713.60s -> 13717.60s]  But we actually win the game if we play it slow.
[13717.60s -> 13719.60s]  Like, we can, we can slow play this game out in scale,
[13719.60s -> 13720.60s]  but it just takes time.
[13720.60s -> 13729.58s]  Because I specifically picked Ash so that we can,
[13729.58s -> 13731.58s]  we had an answer for Sarah.
[13731.58s -> 13733.58s]  Because we have TF and Ash, right?
[13733.58s -> 13735.58s]  So we have, we have a really good answer for him.
[13735.58s -> 13742.58s]  The problem is, we need to stop tilting and just like understand that we can deal with him later.
[13742.58s -> 13744.58s]  He's not like an asle, right?
[13744.58s -> 13747.58s]  Like asle is one of those champs that you can't deal with.
[13750.98s -> 13753.98s]  Why did my mumu wait to use ulti?
[13754.98s -> 13755.98s]  What?
[13756.98s -> 13757.98s]  He was in range.
[13759.98s -> 13760.98s]  I know he was.
[13768.22s -> 13770.22s]  Oh, nice. Okay, we got a kill.
[13771.22s -> 13773.22s]  We need TF to play the game too though.
[13774.22s -> 13782.88s]  Our TF is really tilted so he's just sitting but a movie was extra tilted too, but I mean
[13782.88s -> 13788.98s]  I'll be honest the emum was playing worse than TF it's just that he's did I hate when stuff happens like this
[13788.98s -> 13794.48s]  Stop, stop hanging the guy man. He's already frustrated you pinging him is not gonna make him less frustrated
[13794.48s -> 13796.48s]  You're just gonna piss him off more
[13798.48s -> 13804.62s]  But I just play it dude. We have a really good team comp
[13805.82s -> 13808.22s]  Like we're behind right now, but we have a good team comp
[13814.62s -> 13819.14s]  we should give this dragon by the way, they get thousand percent.
[13819.14s -> 13820.06s]  We don't have t-pulse.
[13821.26s -> 13823.98s]  Like maybe we could fight this, but the morgue's here,
[13823.98s -> 13826.42s]  so she can spell from my arrow, they got rifts.
[13826.42s -> 13830.10s]  Like we should give the drink.
[13830.10s -> 13832.66s]  We also have no vision control of this area.
[13833.82s -> 13835.70s]  So this is another thing of like why,
[13835.70s -> 13839.06s]  you guys wonder why I play support in this yellow.
[13839.06s -> 13841.42s]  I gotta ask them why, oh, are you a support man now?
[13841.42s -> 13843.58s]  I'm still on 80 main, but the thing is,
[13843.58s -> 13847.26s]  it's really hard to play the game when your supports
[13847.26s -> 13854.26s]  Don't word correctly. We can give this guys. We can give it. It's not a huge deal. No, it's top. We don't have to fight this.
[13855.26s -> 13866.64s]  Guys, we don't have to fight this. Let's back up. Yeah, like this isn't fight. It's only second dragon. It's nothing.
[13867.64s -> 13884.04s]  Wow, I suck at CSN. But you see how little vision control we have on the map right now. We have one word here and that's about it.
[13884.04s -> 13889.60s]  vision control is I say it's 90% of the game and so will kill that's why I
[13889.60s -> 13892.44s]  feel like supports are like the unsung hero like when you get a support you
[13892.44s -> 13902.94s]  know it's had a properly throughout vision control it feels insane we just got
[13902.94s -> 13908.98s]  a push I do have Hawkshot and in a second we can see if they're on this
[13908.98s -> 13923.51s]  they're not I can ball me we can back up Cosics is above me right now okay
[13923.51s -> 13925.51s]  Okay, Cosics wasted his ult. That's not bad.
[13926.85s -> 13929.87s]  We should back. I don't want to take this fight.
[13929.87s -> 13933.07s]  TF could ulti, but he's not, right?
[13934.19s -> 13938.43s]  Like this, this is one of those moments where I like, actually think we actually could have killed two of them right there.
[13938.75s -> 13940.75s]  If TF ulted,
[13940.75s -> 13951.68s]  because they were out of position really hard. But again, it's not like, I think they're gonna walk, I think, Cosics is...
[13953.06s -> 13955.06s]  Yeah, he's somewhere up here. I don't know where he is.
[13955.06s -> 13959.98s]  And I can't I can't I can't hawkshot. I wasted my hawkshot for this dragon or this barren
[13960.54s -> 13964.04s]  They could be on barren
[13964.40s -> 13966.40s]  We need to check but I have no hawkshots
[13966.96s -> 13968.88s]  Okay, they're not they're not we're chown good
[13969.60s -> 13983.92s]  Any 100 golds?
[13983.92s -> 13986.96s]  Yeah, I'm aware I'm getting ganked I'm I'm fully fucking aware trust me
[13987.44s -> 14004.07s]  I'm just trying to force them to make a choice
[14004.71s -> 14019.44s]  Probably wasn't a great use of my ghost, but I say we bail I need to go get my item
[14021.76s -> 14024.84s]  As real is just pushing aside somehow. I'm contested over there
[14024.84s -> 14039.51s]  Somebody is TP bought what what the fuck is this a moomu doing
[14040.41s -> 14042.41s]  What is my team doing what are you guys doing?
[14043.01s -> 14057.56s]  This is so awkward man. I mean guys guys kill the cause X oh
[14058.64s -> 14060.64s]  Thank God
[14060.64s -> 14064.68s]  I don't know why cause X just dove to kill me of all people
[14065.76s -> 14069.60s]  My man just like wanted me dead. He was like yeah fuck that 80 carry guy
[14069.60s -> 14073.60s]  Okay, okay, sure
[14075.60s -> 14084.11s]  Fuck me what I want if I can eat damage, but I don't know what gives me the highest damage here
[14085.07s -> 14093.36s]  Maybe just I don't know maybe just PD
[14094.44s -> 14096.20s]  Not I'm not actually sure I
[14098.22s -> 14103.70s]  Would be good, but it doesn't give me like more it gives you like I is interesting in this position
[14105.50s -> 14108.02s]  Like I almost want more movement speed from the like PD
[14109.26s -> 14113.74s]  Even though normally like the utility is better, like maybe BT is still the best and I'm just trolling
[14120.04s -> 14126.04s]  We could just do dragon right now. They have no TP or Barron. I think we totally actually could do this
[14127.32s -> 14129.32s]  I'm down to try if you if you want to ring her
[14131.18s -> 14134.22s]  They got two people bought they're setting up for dragon vision right now
[14134.94s -> 14137.82s]  I'm actually kind of down to just try and play for Barron here
[14144.97s -> 14149.05s]  Like we could bait Barron here and force them to walk into us with my arrow
[14177.60s -> 14182.81s]  I want to stay together because I don't know where the cosmic is.
[14182.81s -> 14194.38s]  Found him.
[14194.38s -> 14195.62s]  What is my mimo doing?
[14195.62s -> 14197.98s]  Dude, he has smite, like, I pull it out
[14197.98s -> 14198.82s]  if you're gonna do this, right?
[14198.82s -> 14217.52s]  Like, I use your brain, man.
[14217.52s -> 14219.72s]  All right, now we do burn though, we have to.
[14219.72s -> 14224.62s]  We have to do burn.
[14224.62s -> 14226.14s]  This is like one of the worst players
[14226.14s -> 14227.06s]  that I've ever seen in this movie.
[14227.06s -> 14229.18s]  He has no clue what he's doing, by the way.
[14230.22s -> 14236.37s]  Like, he's so dumb.
[14236.37s -> 14238.33s]  He's like flaming the TF.
[14238.33s -> 14240.41s]  In his mind, he's so angry at this TF
[14240.41s -> 14243.17s]  that he's ignoring every single thing that's going on.
[14243.17s -> 14246.21s]  Like he's ignoring that like the dragon was a bad call to begin with
[14247.37s -> 14251.91s]  And if we are gonna do that dragon we have to zone the fucking jungle or because he has fucking
[14253.11s -> 14255.11s]  Smite right so it's like
[14256.37s -> 14258.37s]  What are you talking about that?
[14258.53s -> 14260.53s]  This player is a crazy
[14260.65s -> 14264.29s]  It just feels to me like they're so angry at everything. It's kind of funny
[14266.32s -> 14271.00s]  Okay, I got three items now. I went for the PD because I kind of think the extra movement speed in the extra
[14272.08s -> 14273.36s]  It'll help a lot. I
[14273.36s -> 14279.57s]  I will say both the junglers are playing really well. This game is like
[14280.69s -> 14286.29s]  Interesting like both the assassin junglers are playing pretty well. The enemy's there is playing pretty decent
[14293.10s -> 14299.66s]  What that is not a I mean that was embarrassing like I don't even have words for that
[14301.46s -> 14306.92s]  Like I genuinely don't have words for that shit. I'm missed I
[14311.72s -> 14314.12s]  Can't see we have no vision man
[14314.12s -> 14325.49s]  like we have no vision. Nothing's warded because the Moomood didn't put any
[14325.49s -> 14332.85s]  wards down. So I can't fight because literally we're standing there in this
[14332.85s -> 14341.86s]  area and there's nothing warded. The best part is all a Moomood had to do was not
[14341.86s -> 14346.98s]  die before that fight and we auto win. But we were winning so hard. But this
[14346.98s -> 14351.38s]  Moomood is actually solo losing us the game with this fucking ego. Oh,
[14351.38s -> 14353.38s]  support players are so bad at league!
[14355.86s -> 14360.45s]  Actually, and they'll deflect.
[14360.45s -> 14363.97s]  Support players will wide themselves about how good they are,
[14363.97s -> 14366.37s]  and tell them that it's always their team's fault,
[14366.37s -> 14371.73s]  but they'll drop nine deaths, have nine KP in a fucking 23 kill game,
[14371.73s -> 14373.33s]  and then blame their fucking team.
[14375.01s -> 14376.21s]  It's crazy!
[14384.64s -> 14386.16s]  Please ward things, man.
[14394.44s -> 14395.48s]  Oh my god.
[14395.48s -> 14408.31s]  He's dead again. Guys, why are we up here top? Why are we top guys?
[14415.01s -> 14417.01s]  Why are we three-maning top right now?
[14418.45s -> 14420.45s]  Holy crap.
[14421.17s -> 14423.01s]  My teammates are absolute apes.
[14424.05s -> 14425.41s]  Like what am I watching man?
[14428.16s -> 14433.78s]  They just three-man's top. Oh my god.
[14438.08s -> 14440.08s]  Like these are the worst players I've ever fucking seen.
[14440.08s -> 14446.58s]  Like we had the game in our hands and then all of a sudden my team's like, you know what?
[14446.58s -> 14453.08s]  I don't actually want to win and I'm like, why? And they're like, well, you see, I have an ego.
[14453.08s -> 14458.08s]  And you're like, oh, I see. This is why I can't play 80 Karyans, I'm sorry.
[14458.08s -> 14464.08s]  I can't. I have to play support in the CLO because 80 Karyans actually not playable.
[14464.08s -> 14469.56s]  When the entire game is decided by jungle, support, and mid.
[14469.56s -> 14474.76s]  AD Carry just does not decide any of the League of Legends games below Grand Master.
[14474.76s -> 14480.14s]  Not one of them. Like last game, we popped off and we won because we were the better AD Carry, right?
[14480.14s -> 14487.40s]  This game, it doesn't matter. Because TF does 11k damage, doesn't ulti bot more than one time.
[14487.40s -> 14493.04s]  Like, Rengar did well, NAR did well, but they also had a horrible macro.
[14493.04s -> 14501.74s]  Like it is insane to me, how easy support is as a role, and I just how dog shit every support player is on the server.
[14501.74s -> 14511.74s]  Like your role requires zero thought. Your thought when playing support is, do I get vision or not?
[14511.74s -> 14514.74s]  If no, where can I be the most useful?
[14514.74s -> 14519.74s]  Your thought should never be. This game's over. My team sucks.
[14519.74s -> 14531.07s]  It drives me ludicrous, like I'm sorry that I have to play support on this account to climb,
[14531.07s -> 14535.23s]  but it's crazy how dog shit 80 carriers when you're soul-wooking in masters.
[14535.23s -> 14539.99s]  Like in GM, like if it's a full GM game, 80 carries easiest fuck.
[14539.99s -> 14544.39s]  Like if everybody has a brain activity and they're not idiots, 80 carriers amazing.
[14544.39s -> 14545.71s]  Favorite role in the game.
[14545.71s -> 14550.43s]  When you're playing with people who don't know what they're doing and you're actively trying to climb and improve,
[14550.43s -> 14554.75s]  it genuinely feels like I'm pulling out a ball here with my tweezers.
[14554.75s -> 14559.39s]  We're pulling out my ball hairs with tweezers, like one by one.
[14559.39s -> 14564.47s]  It is so painful.
[14564.47s -> 14568.92s]  It's crazy.
[14568.92s -> 14572.40s]  Like let's take a look at this support main, right now.
[14572.40s -> 14575.00s]  97 LP, negative one rate, right?
[14576.32s -> 14580.84s]  I could literally tell that he was not a good player
[14580.84s -> 14587.57s]  in the first 30 seconds of that game.
[14587.57s -> 14588.89s]  I'm sorry I'm being mean, but dude,
[14588.89s -> 14594.46s]  this has been driving me crazy.
[14594.46s -> 14597.22s]  Like look at the support I had last game.
[14597.22s -> 14599.02s]  Also, can I ask you a question?
[14599.02s -> 14601.46s]  Why am I even allowed?
[14601.46s -> 14604.90s]  Why am I even allowed to be in games
[14604.90s -> 14607.98s]  with a Challenger Support one game?
[14607.98s -> 14609.90s]  I win the game.
[14609.90s -> 14612.54s]  Then immediately it puts me in a game
[14612.54s -> 14620.68s]  with a 97 LP master support.
[14620.68s -> 14627.87s]  What is this matchmaking?
[14627.87s -> 14634.59s]  This is insane.
[14634.59s -> 14658.16s]  That's crazy.
[14658.16s -> 14665.25s]  I don't even, I'm wondering why
[14665.25s -> 14667.29s]  So I'm gonna go on a rant for a second.
[14667.29s -> 14669.17s]  Why is this allowed?
[14669.17s -> 14670.85s]  Why can you be in a game?
[14670.85s -> 14673.09s]  Why can I be in a game with a literal guy
[14673.09s -> 14674.73s]  who's about to promote to challenge it?
[14675.97s -> 14677.97s]  Right, we win the game.
[14677.97s -> 14679.69s]  And then the very next game
[14679.69s -> 14684.96s]  it puts me in a game where the guy who's 97 L.P.
[14684.96s -> 14700.97s]  This isn't sane.
[14700.97s -> 14702.85s]  Sorry, that's just frustrating as fuck.
[14704.29s -> 14709.02s]  Because it's like such bad game design.
[14709.02s -> 14718.08s]  Right, like that's 900 L.P. difference.
[14718.08s -> 14722.84s]  And the thing is, this guy doesn't have good MMR, right?
[14722.84s -> 14727.92s]  Like, it's not, it's not like this guy has good MMR, right?
[14727.92s -> 14729.68s]  Because we'll get his games.
[14729.68s -> 14732.00s]  He's playing with all master's players.
[14732.00s -> 14737.16s]  They're all like 100 LP masters, 70 LP, 30 LP, right?
[14737.16s -> 14738.04s]  It doesn't make sense.
[14738.04s -> 14740.28s]  It's not like his MMR is high.
[14740.28s -> 14746.40s]  So why is this guy getting into like a 600 LP grandmaster game?
[14746.40s -> 14748.76s]  Why are we putting that guy in the game?
[14748.76s -> 14749.60s]  That's so frustrating.
[14749.60s -> 14757.36s]  Sorry, I just need a defense.
[14757.36s -> 14760.00s]  How do you know which AD carry pick in each situation?
[14760.00s -> 14762.80s]  It's a lot of knowledge, a lot of knowledge.
[14764.56s -> 14768.40s]  Well, you have to know a lot of shit.
[14768.40s -> 14770.40s]  Like what the enemy champions do,
[14770.40s -> 14773.00s]  what your champions need to do to win the game,
[14773.00s -> 14774.24s]  what the win cons are.
[14775.32s -> 14778.08s]  You can just pick, it would be honest though,
[14778.08s -> 14781.72s]  you could just pick,
[14781.72s -> 14783.36s]  like there are 80 carries in the current meta
[14783.36s -> 14786.40s]  where you can just pick that of blinds like I was making it to your list. I forgot about it.
[14787.12s -> 14789.68s]  But I mean you can blind pick jinx pretty much every game.
[14791.20s -> 14795.12s]  Like jinx is just blindable every game pretty much. She's insane. She's super OP.
[14796.16s -> 14799.28s]  So I get to you if you ever just want to play a champion and you think like okay I want to
[14799.28s -> 14801.52s]  practice A.D. Like jinx is insane. Super good.
[14805.47s -> 14810.11s]  Travins not blindable, but I do think he's really good if you're good at the game.
[14810.11s -> 14814.75s]  Travins very good. He's he's he's harder than jinx by a mile like
[14814.75s -> 14816.15s]  like Dr. M's about harder,
[14816.15s -> 14818.79s]  but he's definitely like good at carrying
[14818.79s -> 14821.92s]  with the way you diswell.
[14821.92s -> 14824.00s]  Like another blindable AD that I think it's like A tier
[14824.00s -> 14825.44s]  is like Varus.
[14825.44s -> 14827.64s]  You can blind pick Varus really easily
[14827.64s -> 14830.76s]  because Varus doesn't really have counters.
[14830.76s -> 14832.84s]  Like he doesn't get countered by anything.
[14832.84s -> 14834.24s]  He's more of like a,
[14834.24s -> 14837.28s]  you can pick him and then go even
[14837.28s -> 14838.76s]  and your old team will always be useful.
[14838.76s -> 14840.60s]  You can look to like win lane.
[14840.60s -> 14867.57s]  You can look to like engage things like that, right?
[14867.57s -> 14872.81s]  Okay, so this game as the support. I need to be tracking the jungler
[14874.83s -> 14882.39s]  So I'm gonna think where I'll always be thinking what the enemy jungler wants to accomplish and how to stop it. That's like a pretty big tip of advice
[14882.39s -> 14884.39s]  I can give you guys
[14884.87s -> 14889.57s]  Like think to yourself like okay if I was the enemy jungler, what would I be wanting to do against this Graham? So right as Lisa
[14891.03s -> 14894.75s]  He's probably gonna want to either gank early my gank bot early or he wants to
[14894.75s -> 14899.75s]  to invade on certain timers, right?
[14899.75s -> 14901.59s]  Because that's like, what we is really good at
[14901.59s -> 14902.79s]  is ganking and invading.
[14902.79s -> 14907.79s]  So, what I think I'm gonna try to do this game
[14907.79s -> 14911.71s]  is I'm gonna try and watch for early ganks
[14911.71s -> 14915.51s]  and early pressure bot lane, like level two, level three ganks.
[14915.51s -> 14918.51s]  We're still gonna be aggressive, but Lux took TP,
[14918.51s -> 14920.11s]  which means this Lux does not plan
[14920.11s -> 14922.23s]  on playing aggressive at all.
[14922.23s -> 14924.27s]  Like she basically, if anybody takes TP,
[14924.27s -> 14929.87s]  like this in a lane. I already know from start of the game that they're not planning on doing anything.
[14929.87s -> 14934.67s]  So I'm probably going to end up roaming a lot this game. This is going to be a game where I roam a ton.
[14934.67s -> 14952.74s]  We do have some good lanes to roam too, too. Like I'm roaming top and mid is both really good.
[14952.74s -> 14970.86s]  I just wanted to ward early because I don't want to get shit on my way.
[14970.86s -> 14978.10s]  So, okay. I'm just going to flash immediately. There's no reason to not flash there because
[14978.10s -> 14982.34s]  the alicer used this flash to get my flash, which is totally fine.
[14982.34s -> 14990.80s]  It's better for him because he has hex flash, but it's not that bad.
[14990.80s -> 14997.84s]  Because I can out-range him and I can stay away from his... his shit.
[14997.84s -> 15000.48s]  So we know he's in the bush, we just chill.
[15000.48s -> 15004.56s]  There it is, he fucked up, now we go forward.
[15004.56s -> 15007.92s]  I don't know why Lux isn't throwing spells at this guy, like, I don't know why she didn't
[15007.92s -> 15009.92s]  queue him.
[15009.92s -> 15012.92s]  He fucked up that the Alistair should have died there.
[15012.92s -> 15014.92s]  And she's painting me. Okay.
[15014.92s -> 15015.92s]  The Alistair should have died there.
[15015.92s -> 15019.92s]  If Alistair ever fucked up and engaged like that, where he hex flashes in, gets stuck.
[15019.92s -> 15022.92s]  Like, he was cooldowned. Yeah, I don't know why I was thrown this way. I'm saying.
[15022.92s -> 15027.92s]  You don't throw spells that aren't going to land.
[15027.92s -> 15033.36s]  So there's no point in the box ever throwing her cue until Alistair fucked up the combo.
[15033.36s -> 15035.36s]  Like, she should have spoken with E.
[15035.36s -> 15038.36s]  And then, um, because it's almost like a blitz hook, right?
[15038.36s -> 15040.36s]  Think of it like a blitz hook.
[15040.36s -> 15045.64s]  If she throws the Q out right now they have an opportunity to be aggressive because they know
[15046.20s -> 15047.80s]  They know the hook is down
[15048.84s -> 15052.12s]  So it's better for her to just hold the hook essentially right
[15053.64s -> 15058.84s]  Hold the Q and now when Avus or does go in they have to be nervous about that Q
[15059.48s -> 15064.12s]  Because they can't just think oh the Q's down. Let's let's engage right so they can't actually think about that
[15065.16s -> 15067.16s]  This is why I don't like
[15067.16s -> 15077.41s]  A lot of the time doing this, like push, push the wave.
[15077.41s -> 15081.41s]  They can't engage on us without flashing, so it doesn't matter, like luck.
[15081.41s -> 15090.15s]  Did she queue the wave again or am I an idiot?
[15090.15s -> 15093.15s]  Like, just, oh man, I'm losing my mind here.
[15093.15s -> 15096.15s]  Aw, I'm tilting. It's fun.
[15096.15s -> 15100.15s]  I need to not tilt, I need to just chill, but I'm getting frustrated because we're like,
[15100.15s -> 15104.15s]  not using cooldowns properly and it's driving me fucking crazy.
[15104.15s -> 15109.94s]  because these are very simple things to do.
[15109.94s -> 15111.46s]  You guys gotta walk the way of any, by the way,
[15111.46s -> 15112.54s]  you can't let them freeze.
[15112.54s -> 15113.54s]  Okay.
[15113.54s -> 15114.54s]  There are very simple things to do.
[15114.54s -> 15115.70s]  I know I'm being annoying a shit,
[15115.70s -> 15117.74s]  whining about this, but this is stuff that you,
[15117.74s -> 15120.18s]  you need to be thinking about when you're playing the game.
[15120.18s -> 15121.86s]  Well, you should actively be thinking,
[15121.86s -> 15123.02s]  to combat.
[15123.02s -> 15124.18s]  To combat.
[15124.18s -> 15126.90s]  What can I do with my champions toolkit?
[15126.90s -> 15129.22s]  To stop their champions toolkit?
[15129.22s -> 15132.66s]  And you should be thinking, okay, I have cute, right?
[15132.66s -> 15134.06s]  So what do they want to do?
[15134.06s -> 15136.18s]  They want to go in, okay?
[15136.18s -> 15141.60s]  And when you're thinking, they want to go in, right?
[15141.60s -> 15143.72s]  You should be thinking, okay, when they go in,
[15143.72s -> 15145.32s]  I can just queue.
[15145.32s -> 15147.92s]  And that should be your entire thought process.
[15147.92s -> 15149.48s]  Your thought process should never be,
[15151.00s -> 15153.52s]  oh, maybe I can land a random queue at max range,
[15153.52s -> 15157.24s]  and we can get a kill.
[15157.24s -> 15158.64s]  She queued the wave, yes, that's what I mean.
[15158.64s -> 15162.04s]  Like, you should never queue the wave on walks either
[15162.04s -> 15165.90s]  unless you're going to a 100% reset.
[15165.90s -> 15167.30s]  That would be like, if I hooked the wave
[15167.30s -> 15168.94s]  as like, let's crank or some shit.
[15168.94s -> 15172.06s]  Why is my locks bait pinging my graves?
[15172.10s -> 15175.78s]  Dude, I gotta keep this a hundred percent honest with you, man
[15177.50s -> 15181.00s]  You don't get you you don't get to be mad here
[15181.94s -> 15183.94s]  Why are these players are such babies?
[15187.46s -> 15190.84s]  Jesus Christ what pussy's man these people are such babies?
[15191.36s -> 15196.11s]  The graves played correctly by the way like a hundred percent
[15197.31s -> 15202.87s]  The he's mad at the graves for taking a wave. He wanted to not like he wanted to be able to T.P. back and get the wave
[15202.87s -> 15211.03s]  That's what this lock is so trash that she actually believes that's the Graves Faults that Graves misplayed by pushing the bot wave
[15211.55s -> 15213.55s]  But it was the right play
[15214.27s -> 15220.59s]  Pushing the bot wave was the correct play there because then she doesn't have to TP the whole reason that he's pushing it is to save her teleport
[15221.11s -> 15230.96s]  So that she doesn't have to TP to win players like this are why the game is hard to play right now in the current meta
[15231.36s -> 15236.58s]  Why it feels bad because this lock is trash ever, but you guys can all see this lock is terrible
[15236.74s -> 15240.74s]  She's already made a bunch of mistakes. She's blaming her team. She's being a dipshit, right?
[15241.46s -> 15243.46s]  But
[15243.86s -> 15251.67s]  She can climb up to this elo being this bad because of the system the current system in place
[15268.21s -> 15275.19s]  We should have immediately do baron here dragon them in we should have this come
[15276.39s -> 15278.15s]  You don't have time for this just come to dragon
[15279.75s -> 15288.53s]  Bro the least into show top we should be doing dragon when um
[15297.16s -> 15299.88s]  When this should happens by the way where you have um
[15300.76s -> 15307.20s]  Enemy jungler shows on one side of the map. You should always be playing on the other side of the map to make a counter play
[15308.04s -> 15311.88s]  So jungler shows on top side. We go for dragon, right?
[15312.48s -> 15322.80s]  Easy. Yo, be careful. Alisters going to be there. Xareth's going to be there. Just leave. Just leave. We've been leave.
[15323.36s -> 15327.25s]  I'll do it for you. I'll make you leave. I got you man.
[15327.69s -> 15333.08s]  But we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and
[15333.72s -> 15336.72s]  I need the backing out, but we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back
[15336.72s -> 15339.72s]  And not only do they're probably going to have to back, but
[15341.28s -> 15350.72s]  The enemy was top. I tried man. I tried to flash Q him
[15354.32s -> 15359.72s]  But yeah, it's it's really I don't know a lot of junglers don't I don't think they know what they're oh, I'm dead by the way
[15359.72s -> 15362.52s]  I'm not even gonna pop exhaust. I'm just dead
[15363.80s -> 15369.28s]  I want a jungler's don't know what the goal of the game actually is a lot of them think it's
[15369.28s -> 15386.72s]  I think that was a bad insect, but a lot of junglers think the goal of the game is to like get as much farmers you can and run over the enemy team and ship, but it's actually it is, but it's also about like getting early objectives and turning those small leads and a big leads through objective control, right?
[15386.72s -> 15399.72s]  So like right now, I want to rotate top. Rift is up. I know Lee Sin's gonna be on top side of the map right now. I want to rotate top so that I can help my team by being in the top side of the map because that's where the next play is gonna be made.
[15399.72s -> 15414.04s]  Well the place made mid, but I mean I'm here, so it's fine. Oh my god
[15414.04s -> 15422.52s]  I did not think the fucking least end would be there, too
[15424.28s -> 15435.04s]  Oh, oops, this is rough. I don't really know how to how to play this because I got there in time to counter the gang
[15435.84s -> 15439.08s]  Right I exhausted the guys saved the Xero
[15439.08s -> 15445.18s]  I got there in time to counter the gang, but oh well played
[15445.18s -> 15454.75s]  That's actually mega well-played, but past is a way that was really good.
[15454.75s -> 15465.48s]  I want to push this way then, but I can't.
[15465.48s -> 15470.20s]  Like, uh, you guys are noticing there's no objectives taken on the map yet at 10 minutes,
[15470.20s -> 15471.96s]  which is kind of crazy.
[15471.96s -> 15473.44s]  The alley's doing really good.
[15473.44s -> 15474.88s]  The alley's just not a bad support player.
[15474.88s -> 15484.87s]  He's playing well.
[15484.87s -> 15494.08s]  Like, he's playing very well.
[15494.08s -> 15499.04s]  A lot of this is more of like, I need, I don't have anything to do on the map because, uh,
[15499.04s -> 15503.00s]  I'm trying to help my jungler, but my jungler is trolling.
[15503.00s -> 15505.28s]  It's really rough.
[15505.28s -> 15507.20s]  Because I'm trying to rotate over and help my jungler
[15507.20s -> 15509.20s]  on cooldown, basically.
[15509.20s -> 15511.16s]  But my jungler doesn't want to fight.
[15511.16s -> 15513.28s]  You see, I'm countering the Alistars fight.
[15513.28s -> 15513.88s]  There are ganks.
[15513.88s -> 15521.95s]  It's just, I'm just dead.
[15527.52s -> 15529.68s]  Like, we shouldn't have made that play mid,
[15529.68s -> 15531.48s]  because we knew that they were all there,
[15531.48s -> 15535.08s]  and we knew that our junglers doing this.
[15535.08s -> 15537.08s]  This might just be a jungle diff, honestly.
[15539.08s -> 15542.08s]  Like our AD carry sucks, but it might just be a straight up jungle diff game.
[15542.08s -> 15543.08s]  They do happen.
[15545.08s -> 15553.14s]  Especially in this era where jungle has so much control of the game, they do happen.
[15553.14s -> 15557.14s]  It's a pretty big jungle diff, you know what I know it.
[15557.14s -> 15561.14s]  But yeah, he's saying, yeah, he knows the jungle is getting out, outclassed.
[15561.14s -> 15563.14s]  Insanely hard.
[15563.14s -> 15571.43s]  Because Graves counters Lee Sin, it's a massive counter.
[15571.43s -> 15577.91s]  But this guy doesn't know what he's doing. I think he's a Rengar one trick and Rengar got banned
[15578.59s -> 15580.59s]  I think that's what's going on
[15581.03s -> 15587.89s]  It's a Rengar one trick who got banned out and he tried to play a champion that requires thought not just the I jump you die champ
[15589.07s -> 15599.34s]  Right and he just gets shit on for it. I mean dude. I can't even I can't even do anything this game
[15600.66s -> 15610.37s]  Our top winner is getting his asswept to it's really fucking rough. I mean he's in here. I'm pretty sure
[15610.37s -> 15613.37s]  I was just, it was warded though.
[15614.37s -> 15617.37s]  I mean we can't really do anything here. I'm dead, I think.
[15617.37s -> 15619.37s]  Yeah, I'm just dead.
[15620.37s -> 15624.37s]  This is just rough. I kind of want to go next because I don't think...
[15625.37s -> 15628.37s]  I don't think we have the skill on the team to win.
[15629.37s -> 15634.37s]  The jungle deficit is huge, the 80 deficit is huge, and I can't impact the map.
[15648.40s -> 15651.40s]  I can't, I just can't do anything to impact the map, and it feels really bad.
[15651.40s -> 15664.09s]  Oh, some of which I should have flashed.
[15664.09s -> 15669.68s]  I got like three blocked a little bit when he knocked me in.
[15669.68s -> 15671.88s]  I had to walk the rich and splash them, that's my man.
[15671.88s -> 15673.88s]  Like what was that TP man?
[15673.88s -> 15675.88s]  Oh god, get me out.
[15675.88s -> 15677.88s]  I'm going to be 100% real, get me out.
[15677.88s -> 15679.88s]  That TP was miserable, bad.
[15679.88s -> 15682.88s]  Dude, just TPed to the wave.
[15682.88s -> 15692.46s]  Like what is our blocks doing too?
[15692.46s -> 15696.46s]  Like, I just feel like everybody's late to the fights.
[15735.90s -> 15739.88s]  the
[15739.88s -> 15753.30s]  the graves doesn't want to take fight even though he's playing graves and the
[15753.30s -> 15757.01s]  son
[15757.01s -> 15760.95s]  like I I feel like this is rough is a rough game
[15760.95s -> 15769.16s]  games like this tell me and I kind of just want to go next
[15769.16s -> 15777.34s]  his games like this uh... they are when it will but I feel like I want to go
[15777.34s -> 15779.74s]  next segment all you know
[15779.74s -> 15782.44s]  like a lot he just want to save my mental
[15782.44s -> 15785.98s]  because the oh that's so gross
[15785.98s -> 15789.14s]  by watching what locks did in the early stages of the way in phase just waiting
[15789.14s -> 15791.74s]  These games feel so unpiable, man.
[15793.54s -> 15797.18s]  Like I don't know how else to say it except for it they just feel miserable to play.
[15798.06s -> 15806.06s]  Like I'm trying to focus on playing like improving myself, but it's so hard to know how to improve in games where like
[15807.98s -> 15809.98s]  You genuinely just
[15810.18s -> 15821.23s]  Get no help. My watch has been tilted since like minute two for some reason and my graves has been
[15821.23s -> 15827.07s]  completely pathing wrong, doing wrong shit. It's hard to know how to help. Like I went mid to help,
[15827.71s -> 15835.36s]  counter two of the early ganks, looks still grief to the game. So like yeah, it's just it's hard to know,
[15835.36s -> 15848.27s]  and then top lane wasps, it's so rough, man. Like I'm gonna keep it 100% honest to you.
[15848.67s -> 15860.06s]  If you are a one trick, do not try and play other champs. You will int. You will play badly always,
[15860.06s -> 15867.02s]  and you will end and you will complete like look at this. This is 2.9K damage. As
[15867.82s -> 15877.10s]  they're like, what are we doing? How are these people getting into this ELO? How does this
[15877.10s -> 15887.78s]  locks like in the game? She was against an Alistair bot and she did 1.2.9K damage in a 16-minute game
[15887.78s -> 15895.70s]  against a melee heavy team. Like what is this? What is happening? This guy was
[15895.70s -> 15909.03s]  D430 LP last season and now he's magically in masters. No, we need to fix
[15909.03s -> 15918.34s]  matchmaking. This is this isn't saying. Like this is just a matchmaking
[15918.34s -> 15925.38s]  diff. It's nothing else. My man literally does not belong in master tier 400 LP
[15925.38s -> 15944.64s]  MMR at all. Why you can see that he's not at the level. Dude, I have the
[15944.64s -> 15957.17s]  box player on my team again. Oh, there's a zeroth one trick and a
[15957.17s -> 15965.01s]  ranger one trick on the enemy team. I don't know, man. I guess I care more about
[15965.01s -> 15984.93s]  the ranger than the zeroth, but this is rough. Oh, what's up, Chipoppy? Dude,
[15984.93s -> 15988.61s]  sorry. I hit, yes, on that man. I know the game was winnable. I'm gonna be real,
[15988.61s -> 15993.09s]  but dude, you didn't see what I saw during the early game of that game, Chipoppy.
[15993.09s -> 16006.04s]  Like man, the entire early game of that game was like, we lost lame because locks wouldn't use her cue to fight the Alistair.
[16006.04s -> 16008.04s]  She was using it to farm minions.
[16009.04s -> 16017.04s]  Like she was so scared of being engaged on by the Alistair and the colista, that she would use her cue to max range farm minions.
[16017.04s -> 16021.04s]  Instead of save it, so when the Alistair engages, we just kill him.
[16021.04s -> 16026.60s]  Right, because if I was to ever engage us on me and looks, he just gets killed.
[16026.60s -> 16030.36s]  We just bind him, walk away, and he's stuck there, and he dies, right?
[16030.36s -> 16036.12s]  But for some reason, she didn't understand how to do that, so she was just throwing it
[16036.12s -> 16038.32s]  to farm, so we were just getting gaged on.
[16038.32s -> 16042.64s]  So I started roaming, and every time I was like, roaming to an objective or something,
[16042.64s -> 16046.20s]  the graves would always walk away and not fight.
[16046.20s -> 16049.28s]  Like he wasn't attempting to fight, he was basically just like, oh, I'm going to go farm
[16049.28s -> 16050.28s]  some more.
[16050.28s -> 16051.60s]  But I'm like, dude, you can't do that.
[16051.60s -> 16053.84s]  If the alisters ganking mid, and I'm countering mid,
[16053.84s -> 16055.94s]  you can't just farm before coming mid,
[16055.94s -> 16058.08s]  or you can't just not take dragon and shetling that, right?
[16058.08s -> 16060.92s]  Like, it blows my mind, that these players can get,
[16060.92s -> 16062.32s]  like, it's like this guy, too.
[16062.32s -> 16065.08s]  Same thing, like that jungler last game, right?
[16065.08s -> 16065.92s]  Look at this.
[16065.92s -> 16068.76s]  It's the same thing as the last game, like NA is riddled with this shit.
[16068.76s -> 16070.80s]  And it's so miserable to play.
[16070.80s -> 16072.64s]  Look at this, this jungler last game, right?
[16072.64s -> 16074.72s]  He's not, he's what, like, a D1 player, right?
[16074.72s -> 16076.48s]  He's not a bad player, he beats D1,
[16076.48s -> 16078.48s]  but why is this guy in this game now?
[16078.48s -> 16080.64s]  He, like, art officially inflated to the sealow,
[16080.64s -> 16085.28s]  getting lucky with his first few games. And now we have to play with this guy. Oh, it's an
[16085.28s -> 16098.80s]  account share. The person, it's a different player. Look, on the account, D flash F flash. So,
[16098.80s -> 16113.66s]  ah, it's a fucking account share. That's, that's frustrating. Sorry for winding so much, guys. This
[16113.66s -> 16118.78s]  shit's just really frustrating to me. Like, I know I should play it to like, specifically,
[16118.78s -> 16122.78s]  only care about like improving and then while you're improving you'll climb automatically
[16122.78s -> 16129.34s]  in shit but it's really frustrating when like the players in the game would rather be
[16129.34s -> 16133.34s]  idiots and assholes to each other than play the game right like the game before the
[16133.34s -> 16136.78s]  Moomoo right the game before this the Moomoo was just being toxic the whole game and
[16136.78s -> 16140.86s]  entered the win away the last game the locks and the graves were being toxic to each other
[16140.86s -> 16147.50s]  the whole game we entered the game away it's like it's it's it's it's not fun to lose
[16147.50s -> 16156.91s]  Because one player gets mad at another player over them both being idiots. I'm sorry. It's not fun. It's so unfun.
[16158.19s -> 16175.48s]  But we'll try and we'll try and win this one. All we can really do is try and carry the games, right?
[16176.88s -> 16178.88s]  It's about it.
[16178.88s -> 16196.74s]  What is what? What man? What? What do you think they're gonna do to me? Welcome to the league of you.
[16196.74s -> 16202.02s]  Think of it for the seven months man. Welcome back. I really don't want to meet all I don't I don't I don't want to meet all
[16202.58s -> 16218.37s]  Because like I I want to like value the penguins and shit, but dude if they walk up. I'm gonna find them
[16219.05s -> 16254.32s]  That's what I'm standing here. Okay there. I mean that's a big queue
[16255.04s -> 16257.04s]  I need to get level two first here 100%
[16276.21s -> 16278.21s]  Ash should have just been autoing there that whole time
[16280.05s -> 16282.77s]  Because we have heal so she should have just walked up an autoed
[16282.77s -> 16290.49s]  As soon as this is what I mean by tracking cooldowns, as soon as the Nico missed her, as soon as the Nico missed her cooldowns,
[16290.49s -> 16298.97s]  as soon as she missed her E, the Ash should have just walked up and immediately started fighting, right, like because they can no longer kill us.
[16298.97s -> 16308.07s]  The Nico doesn't actually have spells outside of her E, right? So if she misses that snare, and she used her W too, right?
[16308.07s -> 16315.99s]  So it's like, we just go ham. You don't need to be too scared. It happens quite a bit sometimes where people will just be like,
[16315.99s -> 16339.82s]  really nervous damn if I had dodged that queue I actually would have killed all three damn
[16340.54s -> 16345.18s]  I don't know if it was worth the flash after the guy I actually I think it was if I had dodged the queue I wouldn't have been fun
[16346.14s -> 16350.38s]  So that was that it's whatever act also doesn't miss any creeps here
[16350.86s -> 16359.35s]  So it's not the end of the world like I'm pretty sure Lisa and did not have his top camps by the way
[16366.55s -> 16369.27s]  Damn if I was a little better mechanically I turned that by the way
[16369.27s -> 16371.27s]  100%
[16373.82s -> 16400.20s]  We should push this wave so that I can go get vision is yeah that guy can't freeze that wave so
[16403.34s -> 16404.34s]  It's not too bad
[16404.34s -> 16424.97s]  We sense top
[16424.97s -> 16426.97s]  You can kind of see some really good
[16431.19s -> 16433.19s]  What is this?
[16433.19s -> 16435.19s]  Why's my car this AFK turret?
[16435.19s -> 16453.64s]  What is happening right now?
[16453.64s -> 16466.04s]  Why was he AFK?
[16466.04s -> 16470.28s]  I mean I guess it worked out, but yeah, maybe I'd to go let his cat out. I don't know
[16470.28s -> 16482.20s]  Now, it happens, we do their ballings not very good.
[16482.20s -> 16489.94s]  They're trying to hard to force fights that they can't win.
[16489.94s -> 16493.94s]  They genuinely can't win half of these fights that they're trying to force.
[16493.94s -> 16497.94s]  Maybe if they were against people who don't push their buttons, they could win those, but it's like,
[16497.94s -> 16501.94s]  all I have to do is stand there and fight back and they was, they're on dragon,
[16501.94s -> 16502.94s]  not thousand percent right now.
[16502.94s -> 16505.94s]  There's not a lot I can do about that.
[16505.94s -> 16506.94s]  We just have to chill.
[16506.94s -> 16508.94s]  There's almost nothing I can do about it.
[16508.94s -> 16512.18s]  Kaisa's trying to fake act like she's big, but it's
[16515.77s -> 16517.77s]  There's just nothing we can do
[16517.77s -> 16521.78s]  Because our card this is top so we just chill
[16522.42s -> 16529.49s]  They finished the chair of us? No, no, no, not yet. Oh
[16533.77s -> 16535.77s]  Lisa could be bot right now
[16537.41s -> 16541.85s]  I don't think it's too bad if he's bot though. They can't really dive us especially with card the salts
[16557.04s -> 16559.28s]  Why why is my ash just run?
[16559.28s -> 16567.82s]  She like just straight up runs away. It's kind of silly
[16576.86s -> 16581.56s]  Because we have we have cartless ulti like we can win a five-y-f-erah, we can win a fight bot right now
[16581.56s -> 16588.80s]  I guess I guess I'm just gonna have to get them well enough for cartless to kill them
[16590.32s -> 16592.32s]  Like without the ashes help
[16593.60s -> 16599.15s]  Which I think I can do. It's not too bad. Okay, the call is coming bot
[16600.39s -> 16612.70s]  We just killed them. I mean, it was just fight. I don't know why we just as share honestly
[16615.14s -> 16623.17s]  Just that's your room. Okay, that was pretty bad asher, but
[16630.70s -> 16633.58s]  Filled uh, I don't think he's filled I think he's just having a bad game
[16635.10s -> 16637.10s]  Like how they it happens, you know
[16637.82s -> 16642.74s]  Whoa, okay
[16642.74s -> 16644.74s]  Do it. Alt me. I fucking dare you
[16649.44s -> 16651.44s]  I'm trying to keep some mana
[16651.68s -> 16666.58s]  So that I can ulti
[16666.58s -> 16668.90s]  Oh, cards that start to use this ult's fuck
[16675.38s -> 16677.38s]  They both backed there. Wow
[16681.78s -> 16684.18s]  My bad. I honestly didn't think they were both gonna back there
[16684.18s -> 16691.40s]  I thought the Kai said was going to back right where I saw her my glass. That's my bad
[16692.40s -> 16694.40s]  Hmm, I should be
[16694.40s -> 16701.34s]  I think we send can come bot here and kill me. I should actually stop this guy's back
[16702.06s -> 16712.31s]  Yeah, I should stop his back because it's more value to stop the back now even if we send isn't that it's more value
[16713.59s -> 16715.59s]  Because he's so low
[16715.59s -> 16719.59s]  Callie is me, I don't know, so we gotta be care.
[16719.59s -> 16723.59s]  I wasted my ult though, which makes me kinda scared.
[16723.59s -> 16733.77s]  The other thing that kind of sucks about this is we don't have good vision.
[16733.77s -> 16737.77s]  And I can't really help anybody on the map because the same thing is happening as before.
[16737.77s -> 16741.77s]  Or like we're missing opportunities to get kills on timers.
[16741.77s -> 16747.30s]  I mean the dog lighting guy is playing fine with his game.
[16747.30s -> 16751.30s]  I think he's trolled a lot, like he's trolling, this isn't like his best game.
[16751.30s -> 16756.30s]  but it's also I don't know why we're getting so tilted around the map right now
[16756.30s -> 16760.30s]  because if I'm if I'm being honest we should just win the game off of like
[16760.30s -> 16774.86s]  being better players I don't know what this car this is thinking but
[16774.86s -> 16781.57s]  do it do it do it do it
[16781.57s -> 16788.90s]  hard this we can fight we can fight just fight bro what are we doing
[16788.90s -> 16795.90s]  I'm losing at man ah non a non I'm tilted I'm tilted as fuck he didn't walk in
[16795.90s -> 16798.90s]  Just go on to the a cally shroud, man.
[16800.40s -> 16804.40s]  I just walk a foot to your right and stand on the a cally shroud.
[16804.90s -> 16807.90s]  She just eats your damage, like while she's in the shroud.
[16807.90s -> 16808.90s]  She can't stop that.
[16812.83s -> 16814.83s]  Holy shit, I'm losing my mind.
[16816.70s -> 16821.20s]  Like, Ash is just inting bot waves right now, not trying to do anything.
[16822.20s -> 16826.90s]  Watch this really far up on CS, which is really good, but I'm losing it, man.
[16826.90s -> 16831.30s]  Like we see exactly where they are every game.
[16831.30s -> 16837.30s]  Like we see where everybody is on the enemy team permanently and we still can't manage to like walk to the right location.
[16837.30s -> 16839.30s]  This is driving me crazy.
[16839.30s -> 16849.52s]  My my car this 80 my car this jungle is getting out formed like a car this jungle is getting out formed by at least in jungle.
[16849.52s -> 16850.92s]  That's insane.
[16850.92s -> 16854.92s]  Like I don't think I don't think I can stress enough how crazy that is.
[16854.92s -> 16860.66s]  Like there should never be a world where car this ever gets out forms.
[16860.66s -> 16872.51s]  no way I'm dead dude no way I just fucking ate the end of that now I'm playing
[16872.51s -> 16888.46s]  that just kill the least in man I fucked up there that was my fault cuz I
[16888.46s -> 16892.24s]  got hit by the tip of the that was my fault I got barely equipped by the
[16892.24s -> 16896.14s]  tip of the knee goalt when I was trying to space cuz I'm bad and if I was a
[16896.14s -> 16899.30s]  live there and I could have saved my flash for the least in queue we just went I
[16899.30s -> 16905.99s]  I am confused at why we decided to not fight that immediately though.
[16905.99s -> 16909.99s]  We caught out two of their members and we just got scared for whatever reason.
[16909.99s -> 16911.99s]  Wait, we won this fight.
[16911.99s -> 16914.99s]  With the 1000% win this fight, this fight, this fight, this...
[16914.99s -> 16931.40s]  Bro, do not throw a fucking temper tantrum right now.
[16931.40s -> 16935.40s]  There's one kill. Do not throw a temper tantrum.
[16935.40s -> 16939.93s]  Oh my god, here we go.
[16939.93s -> 16942.93s]  I took one kill. The guy's about to lose his mind, guys.
[16942.93s -> 16958.06s]  I need to mute all I'm gonna mute all in a second like I I can't with these people right now
[16958.78s -> 16963.38s]  Like I can't cement you people are disgusting
[16964.66s -> 16966.66s]  Like you guys just
[16966.66s -> 16973.14s]  Wine you play bad you wine and you bitch about every little mistake that everything happens even though it's like in the middle of a fight
[16973.14s -> 16978.54s]  I guarantee him a better player than you are and you're still winding and crying over one shutdown that like
[16978.54s -> 16985.28s]  You didn't even walk to until I spam ping do like I literally won't be to them. You hit one e and then your mad
[16985.78s -> 16991.05s]  Do I swear lead players are fucking psychopaths?
[16991.73s -> 16998.47s]  At least I got the exhaust off. Surely she dies, right?
[16999.23s -> 17004.23s]  Surely she dies there. Or not. Okay. Okay, I'll at least she died
[17006.03s -> 17008.03s]  Help each other guys
[17008.59s -> 17012.48s]  Help each other teamwork
[17012.48s -> 17014.48s]  teamwork teamwork teamwork teamwork
[17015.24s -> 17021.43s]  Wait, this ash isn't saying
[17025.77s -> 17031.01s]  Okay, I'm not gonna lie that ash played that so good. I only saw the end of it and she still played that good
[17032.45s -> 17034.45s]  That was sick
[17034.95s -> 17041.20s]  Well, well done. That was actually really good. She almost stopped the dive
[17042.16s -> 17047.66s]  That's crazy
[17047.66s -> 17050.86s]  This game is definitely 1,000% still win a bulldozer
[17051.34s -> 17053.34s]  We just have to play
[17053.34s -> 17059.38s]  Poor late game and not lose our fucking minds. I'll let that push back into my ash. I'll go mid get some vision
[17060.06s -> 17064.14s]  That's pretty much all we have to do
[17064.70s -> 17075.50s]  Quite for late and not lose our mind early. We could play to kill this a call here right now. She doesn't know. There's no word here
[17076.74s -> 17082.97s]  We also invade here. Oh, that's so unlucky
[17084.33s -> 17091.64s]  That was such a close queue kill that guy
[17091.64s -> 17123.85s]  Jesus Christ. I feel like we should have won that by it. I felt like something awkward happened and we lost
[17124.73s -> 17131.59s]  Did my ash just walk directly into this a cally and not use her ulti use your ulti you have ulti use your ulti?
[17132.33s -> 17134.33s]  Oh, oh my god
[17134.33s -> 17146.51s]  What the fuck? Oh, oh, oh my god
[17148.31s -> 17152.43s]  I don't even know what to say right now. This is insane
[17152.43s -> 17159.23s]  This genuinely feels like everybody in the game is losing their mind in the freeest game I've ever seen in my life
[17163.60s -> 17169.82s]  Like that's what we're losing to right there that guy the guy who like doesn't understand how sent a works
[17170.46s -> 17176.76s]  Like that player that's why I'm frustrated like that player right there has no idea how sent a works
[17177.40s -> 17180.64s]  Try's to fight me and we're like losing to that guy
[17180.64s -> 17185.68s]  I'm trying really hard not to be an asshole, but like it's flooding out right now from these games
[17187.88s -> 17197.14s]  It's crazy, but he's so toxic. Look at this he went pro-do belt I only a boot
[17199.78s -> 17221.44s]  Nico, but like what that doesn't do anything to help his team you could arrow that guy. I mean, it's not impossible
[17223.36s -> 17225.36s]  Or don't that's fun. Oh
[17225.36s -> 17249.97s]  oh my god guys I think my locks is a okay she's been sitting in base for like five minutes
[17249.97s -> 17260.21s]  I think she's like it literally just throwing or some chips
[17260.21s -> 17274.78s]  I let's push the Swift we could make a pick right now
[17274.78s -> 17287.01s]  Jack's what are you doing man why are you up there oh no also why does this ash have
[17287.01s -> 17298.42s]  the worst build I've ever seen dude if we lose do the kaisa that just did that I'm gonna lose my
[17298.42s -> 17318.52s]  I'm on wait that guy just blind art in without any vision of anybody and just died
[17319.36s -> 17334.35s]  There's no way we can lose this we got this guys just play like I just need to I need help getting vision control on barren and mid and then we can we can win
[17335.31s -> 17418.69s]  We got this right now. I mean we still got barren, but he did get two of them. I guess
[17421.18s -> 17422.98s]  Or no, yeah, yeah, you got a car this in ash
[17424.46s -> 17426.46s]  But we did get barren, which is very nice
[17426.46s -> 17435.63s]  I'm going to go Dom's this game.
[17435.63s -> 17453.70s]  I'm going to go Black Clover, but I think I'm going to go Dom's.
[17453.70s -> 17457.70s]  I need to get vision control on Dragon and Min.
[17457.70s -> 17473.95s]  I need to get vision control, and I need help to do it though.
[17473.95s -> 17483.64s]  I'm going to act like I'm backing here.
[17483.64s -> 17485.64s]  We should just be pushing mid with Baron.
[17485.64s -> 17487.64s]  I don't know what we're doing.
[17487.64s -> 17491.64s]  Like, low key, it should just be straight up like we go mid with Baron here.
[17491.64s -> 17505.23s]  That fuck was that, that was a terrible play.
[17505.23s -> 17533.70s]  Guys, just come in, we have Baron.
[17533.70s -> 17535.70s]  Nice, huge pick.
[17535.70s -> 17536.70s]  Pushman, pushman.
[17536.70s -> 17538.70s]  Fuck dragon, just pushman.
[17538.70s -> 17547.20s]  Can we back off?
[17547.20s -> 17554.88s]  Oh, I mean, that was bad.
[17554.88s -> 17559.22s]  Guys, back off, back off, back off, back off, we've.
[17559.22s -> 17561.22s]  Leave, leave, leave, leave, please.
[17561.22s -> 17562.22s]  Please, just leave.
[17562.22s -> 17567.64s]  Guys, you can leave, you can leave.
[17567.64s -> 17569.64s]  We just go to dragon, leave.
[17569.64s -> 17574.62s]  We still have so much gold to get on the map,
[17574.62s -> 17580.62s]  map we can go get bot tier 2, bot tier 1, bot tier 2, we have so much gold to go on
[17580.62s -> 17584.62s]  the map, it's not a big deal, we don't need to end the game right the second. We actually
[17584.62s -> 17632.84s]  have Kartis and we have Jacks too, so our scaling is really good. I need to go get, I need
[17632.84s -> 17641.36s]  to go get my next item, but I need enough gold to do it. I also need to go get Wards, the
[17641.36s -> 17646.78s]  I'm gonna like a weird by timer where I don't have enough things to get you know what I'm just gonna get my ward item
[17648.04s -> 17651.08s]  I'm gonna grab this for a now just so we can actually get some power on the map
[17651.80s -> 17656.92s]  Cuz the map's so dark and I think getting the ward item before finishing my last whisper items probably the smartest call
[17656.92s -> 17666.54s]  I am a little concerned why we're not pushing bot with jacks. We're pushing top
[17668.34s -> 17669.94s]  And I'm also concerned why we're not
[17670.98s -> 17674.34s]  playing for mid prior and we're just farming bot side
[17675.94s -> 17677.94s]  This is such an awkward fucking thing.
[17684.06s -> 17687.06s]  We should just be playing for mid-prior and use a erodangage.
[17687.46s -> 17690.46s]  That's how we win. We just use a erodangage when they can test mid.
[17691.18s -> 17693.18s]  It's actually that easy.
[17693.18s -> 17701.36s]  Like, okay, it's actually that easy.
[17708.02s -> 17710.02s]  See? Watch. Now, this guy's dead.
[17710.34s -> 17719.41s]  I mean, that's fine with me.
[17720.25s -> 17722.41s]  You guys want to kill me? That's totally fine.
[17723.41s -> 17738.34s]  Then get the inhib and then they can back up.
[17739.34s -> 17741.34s]  Yeah, I get inhib, back up.
[17741.34s -> 17744.34s]  and then play for Baron.
[17744.34s -> 17748.54s]  They'll only have a few seconds to do this though,
[17748.54s -> 17751.54s]  so it's kind of scary because these two are going to be alive.
[17751.54s -> 17759.31s]  They need to back immediately.
[17759.31s -> 17765.31s]  Just reset. You don't need the way. Just leave.
[17765.31s -> 17769.31s]  Barons up. Barons up. Think about the macro as the macro.
[17769.31s -> 17771.31s]  We play for Baron now.
[17771.31s -> 17776.46s]  Because there's a timer now where you guys just need to reset.
[17776.46s -> 17780.46s]  Because there's a timer where the enemy has tempo on the map.
[17780.46s -> 17784.14s]  And if we don't uh, if we don't allow
[17785.34s -> 17788.54s]  If we don't reset they'll just rush barren and there's nothing we can do about it
[17798.45s -> 17806.62s]  Okay, they're not unbearin. I think they missed their timer. They're on it. No, they're on it. They're on it. They're on it. Okay, they're not on it. We're fun
[17812.79s -> 17815.03s]  We can still fight this though, but we need everybody here
[17815.67s -> 17826.90s]  Just arrow arrow arrow arrow arrow arrow. It doesn't matter if you hit mouth just arrow
[17827.54s -> 17830.18s]  Just arrow him. Thank you
[17830.18s -> 17845.98s]  No, guys, the back line, the back line, play together, play together. Yes! Nice!
[17845.98s -> 17853.63s]  End of the game. You end here.
[17853.63s -> 17860.63s]  Walks, don't back. You are giving me cancer. Okay, they forfeit it. Dude, look how easy that is.
[17860.63s -> 17867.63s]  Look how easy it is to win games when people are listening to macro. Look how easy it is. Oh my god!
[17867.63s -> 17870.27s]  I'm losing it, man.
[17870.27s -> 17872.03s]  I swear to God, I'm losing my hair.
[17872.03s -> 17873.59s]  I can feel my hair falling out right now.
[17873.59s -> 17876.15s]  I can feel it falling out of my fucking head.
[17876.15s -> 17877.91s]  Like I just lost the one that's right there,
[17877.91s -> 17882.35s]  but like it's just fucking killing me, man.
[17882.35s -> 17885.95s]  In game, God, it's so hard.
[17885.95s -> 17888.59s]  I feel so exhausted.
[17888.59s -> 17895.18s]  Like it's so exhausting.
[17895.18s -> 17897.82s]  You put a 44 minute gold game, God damn.
[17897.82s -> 17903.62s]  That's impressive.
[17903.62s -> 17905.80s]  I don't want to honor any of these people.
[17905.80s -> 17906.86s]  Who would you guys honor?
[17907.94s -> 17909.38s]  Like, out of all of them, who would you guys pick?
[17909.38s -> 17911.38s]  Cause I don't know, they also, in my eyes,
[17911.38s -> 17916.34s]  I'm too toxic right now, they all suck.
[17916.34s -> 17920.21s]  Jacks, all right, I'll give it to Jacks.
[17920.21s -> 17922.25s]  Ash, Ash was trying, I'll give you that.
[17922.25s -> 17926.94s]  Ash was trying.
[17926.94s -> 17928.30s]  Dude, look at this looks.
[17929.38s -> 17940.01s]  This looks got so fucking carried, oh my god.
[17941.17s -> 17948.97s]  Don't type to me, you pedestrian.
[17948.97s -> 17959.30s]  It's been called in a pedestrian.
[17959.30s -> 17961.94s]  It's not even insults.
[17961.94s -> 17965.66s]  Like, oh yeah, yeah, wow, fucking pedestrian.
[17965.66s -> 17987.94s]  Like, this is not even an insult, man.
[17987.94s -> 17988.78s]  There it is.
[17990.10s -> 17993.66s]  Guys, I feel like part of my life gets taken away now.
[17993.66s -> 17994.98s]  Ha ha ha.
[17994.98s -> 17996.26s]  Like when I play in my mannequin,
[17996.26s -> 17998.46s]  I'm like super sweaty, try harding and shit.
[17998.46s -> 18000.98s]  I feel like I'm losing like, yeah, it's like,
[18000.98s -> 18003.26s]  it's like every time I lose, it's like one hair.
[18003.26s -> 18005.50s]  like every time I'm like barely win, right?
[18005.50s -> 18035.13s]  It's just like every game in this yellow is like one hair on my head gets fucking burnt out and it just leaves and I'm not like I'm gonna be looking like a Homer Simpson, like look at the difference in wards placed.
[18035.13s -> 18051.44s]  This is what annoys me about bad support players, this guy placed 23, he's more focused on getting kills than placing wards, and it's really stupid, sorry.
[18051.44s -> 18059.42s]  I just don't like some I don't have anything against the dog lightning guy as a person other than like what I've seen on his stream right like on his stream
[18059.68s -> 18061.68s]  He just seems really ego-tistical
[18062.88s -> 18068.48s]  Like he's he's like everything I hate in the average league player he's really he has a massive ego
[18069.44s -> 18076.52s]  Because he reached Challenger on the support role on like an off-met-up pick like last year at some point or something or maybe he's Challenger right now
[18076.52s -> 18077.52s]  I don't even know
[18077.52s -> 18082.56s]  Maybe he has an account in Challenger. I don't even know. But it drives me crazy because like
[18083.12s -> 18089.02s]  He doesn't do anything correctly. Like he gets away with such dumb shit
[18089.54s -> 18094.22s]  Because he like he basically wins lane because he plays extremely aggressively
[18094.74s -> 18101.82s]  But if you guys noticed in that game the reason we won lane or we were able to push back is because they they played aggressively
[18101.82s -> 18106.30s]  But they did it really stupidly like they were fighting us in our own waves
[18106.30s -> 18113.70s]  right like on repeat. They were just fighting us in our own waves. Every time I would just turn a one for one almost the one for two every time
[18113.70s -> 18117.70s]  And it's it's stupid because every time that's happening, they're also giving me souls, right?
[18117.70s -> 18123.36s]  And even like take weird fights and like I know he's probably forepawning. He doesn't carry it's a smurf blah blah blah
[18123.36s -> 18128.36s]  But I just don't like when people like that like ego they're ass off when they place so badly
[18129.42s -> 18137.01s]  It drives me crazy. Why do I care so much? I don't know I
[18137.01s -> 18159.20s]  I don't know.
[18159.20s -> 18161.20s]  How are you guys doing, by the way?
[18161.20s -> 18163.20s]  How's everybody's day going in chat?
[18163.20s -> 18164.20s]  What'd you guys up to?
[18164.20s -> 18165.20s]  Talk to me.
[18165.20s -> 18167.20s]  I know I stopped teaching the game and started
[18167.20s -> 18170.20s]  whining, like I got on my main account a few hours ago.
[18170.20s -> 18172.20s]  And I stopped teaching and I started whining a bunch.
[18172.20s -> 18178.43s]  So, my bad.
[18178.43s -> 18179.43s]  My bad on that one, dude.
[18179.43s -> 18181.43s]  How are you guys doing now?
[18181.43s -> 18182.43s]  How's everybody's day going?
[18182.43s -> 18191.12s]  When is the coaching surface open?
[18191.12s -> 18195.12s]  Oh, I could probably do coaching at some point soon.
[18195.12s -> 18200.00s]  like I'd be willing to do some coaching, some like sub coaching or something or like
[18200.00s -> 18213.18s]  something like that. It might be fun. Suddenly in bronze, you don't get enough time to
[18213.18s -> 18216.78s]  actually improve. Dude, I feel that man. It takes a long time. What he does not an easy
[18216.78s -> 18221.78s]  game to pick up and start playing, right? Like if you're in bronze or silver and you're like,
[18221.78s -> 18224.30s]  oh, I actually, you know, I'm having fun playing the game. I kind of want to try and get
[18224.30s -> 18228.58s]  better. It's you're just overwhelmed with so much info that you like have to play so many
[18228.58s -> 18256.60s]  games, right? I feel you, man. It's overwhelming. Yeah, I feel you. Well, we got
[18256.60s -> 18265.86s]  mid. Okay. Uh, sorry, just by trust. Well, more if I pick Trist that we won't have AP,
[18265.86s -> 18280.21s]  but I also think I'm better at Trist than I am at like other stuff. So I don't know. AP
[18280.21s -> 18288.90s]  verse. I'm not good enough at AP barriseman. I'm going to be real. Well, my mouse is good,
[18288.90s -> 18293.62s]  but the problem with mouse is like, mouse is a shitty champion. Like, mouse is trash, right? So like,
[18295.46s -> 18301.62s]  he's good, but he's like not good in the sense of like, I can play him well. But at the end of the
[18301.62s -> 18310.16s]  day, if they pick something that like counters, mouse, I just lose. Or is like Tristan has just
[18310.16s -> 18315.08s]  free to pick like even if we play all AD right let's say we do all
[18315.08s -> 18317.68s]  AD or some shit like on accidents or because people are one
[18317.68s -> 18321.88s]  treks blah blah blah it's it's still free like Tristan is still like a good
[18321.88s -> 18327.20s]  pick because even with all AD she's still like you can build Lord Doms she has
[18327.20s -> 18330.88s]  incredibly high pressure or a game if you play right right you could push the
[18330.88s -> 18335.48s]  waves roam you can you can roam top room bot help lanes out like level two
[18335.48s -> 18339.12s]  three you can invade jungler's early like she's just incredibly incredibly
[18339.12s -> 18346.03s]  strong. This guy should go Pike. I was going to say they picked new new and I picked
[18346.03s -> 18353.35s]  an 80 mid. They picked new new and Thresh. We should have an engage because because Pike
[18353.35s -> 18368.56s]  Trist, like I can just walk a bot on repeat now and pretty much kill people. Watch an iron
[18368.56s -> 18371.92s]  game, watching an iron game. I feel like it wouldn't be an actual iron game though. What
[18371.92s -> 18382.53s]  it? I've heard I had friends who like intentionally lost a bunch of games. And so that
[18382.53s -> 18383.89s]  if you get to iron four, right?
[18383.89s -> 18386.05s]  They like, they like, into down that iron four,
[18386.05s -> 18388.37s]  whatever, to see if they could make it.
[18388.37s -> 18393.09s]  And there's just so many, like,
[18393.09s -> 18396.25s]  smurf's in iron.
[18396.25s -> 18399.33s]  There's like legitimate bot accounts,
[18400.81s -> 18404.09s]  like accounts that are like being botted, right?
[18404.09s -> 18405.57s]  There's like botted accounts in iron.
[18405.57s -> 18415.96s]  There's like, smurf's all over the place.
[18415.96s -> 18417.12s]  It seems so stopped.
[18417.12s -> 18420.52s]  I wonder if right, like, did something that stopped the bots?
[18421.68s -> 18425.68s]  They must, they may have, like, they may have just been incorporated something that like stops the software.
[18429.68s -> 18433.92s]  But I don't know. I haven't heard anything about it, but I have no clue.
[18434.72s -> 18461.91s]  I'll be real. I don't know. You have to take a fall. You're a last game. I got boots one.
[18463.91s -> 18472.71s]  That sounds awful. I kind of feel bad for actual iron players who are like,
[18474.47s -> 18493.68s]  in iron trying to climb because like, that sounds bad. I do think you can climb
[18493.68s -> 18496.96s]  Obviously out of any yellow it doesn't matter right like if I were to go into an iron game
[18496.96s -> 18498.48s]  I'd probably drop like 50 kills
[18500.60s -> 18504.68s]  But I so I do think you can climb out of any you know any yellow for sure
[18505.16s -> 18523.72s]  You're loving a new count if you guys got a bottom account that answered every time I wrote bot
[18530.68s -> 18542.29s]  That's funny. Yeah, I assume that's a good point. I guess if you're in iron
[18542.53s -> 18547.09s]  You could like play to learn the game a bit better and then you could like play a new account and see where you got
[18547.49s -> 18549.49s]  Yeah, I know that would work
[18549.49s -> 18565.52s]  That makes sense. Sure, I'll first pick man. I'll first pick Santa. I guarantee you they've all can fucking
[18566.16s -> 18569.42s]  These people are gonna walk in fucking uh, not a list or some shit
[18570.58s -> 18572.58s]  It'll be like jarvin not a list
[18576.16s -> 18583.12s]  I don't even know
[18583.12s -> 18587.40s]  Ribbons not too bad, we're saying so you don't get flanks. I actually don't think ribbons too bad right now
[18587.60s -> 18591.24s]  Maybe all the ribbon players I played against suck, but I don't think she's actually that bad
[18591.24s -> 18597.68s]  I think ribbons like just you have to position well. I think ribbons really broken and abusing positioning
[18598.30s -> 18606.24s]  That's why she's so good. It's all cute like good ribbon players. I'll get really gross flanks and the flanks are what's okay
[18606.24s -> 18609.28s]  Yeah, there's the gragas. Okay. I was like they're gonna pick something to fuck me over
[18609.72s -> 18615.08s]  This guy picked Gregus, but it was gonna be like J4 or Gregus or something and
[18615.98s -> 18618.30s]  This guy is the support help our pignautilus
[18619.94s -> 18621.94s]  Unless he's a one trick
[18622.62s -> 18626.14s]  right like unless this guy's straight up just like a one trick. I'll pick like not elicit some
[18626.14s -> 18637.60s]  shits. Maybe Rakan, Rakan or not elicit. Because if he picks him in Chancer, we just win the game.
[18641.87s -> 18649.44s]  He has to pick and gauge. Mirio would be really good here too actually.
[18650.96s -> 18656.72s]  Because Mirio would counter half our team. You can Mirio Q, Wolkong, and Ken and then Gage.
[18658.56s -> 18664.46s]  Like if this guy put Mirio, then so it actually would be a hardline. Tom Kench.
[18664.46s -> 18670.87s]  I mean I I get it, but I think it's bad
[18672.69s -> 18674.69s]  Rins oh shit
[18675.09s -> 18679.87s]  Yo, you just saved me looking like an absolute fool. Thank you
[18681.29s -> 18686.71s]  Holy crap if you wanted to see my rins they're here, but thank you you remind me. I'm gonna be able to get some water. I'll be back
[18687.45s -> 18728.91s]  It's magua
[18728.91s -> 18730.91s]  The people who are here to watch me play 80 Gary
[18732.03s -> 18734.03s]  I some cereal apologize
[18734.03s -> 18743.62s]  I know watching me play Senna is probably boring as fuck. Okay, I know
[18743.62s -> 18752.48s]  I promise you we will play 80 carry at some point. I promise you. I play it like the first four hours of the stream was 80 carry
[18752.48s -> 18757.40s]  And first three right I put on my smurf for a few games and played some AD so if you want to watch that you can go back in the bottom
[18757.64s -> 18759.64s]  We did some my commentary and shit
[18761.32s -> 18765.24s]  The only reason I'm playing so much Senna and support on this account is because like
[18765.24s -> 18771.08s]  Like the the hero I'm currently in is like the worst hero to climb in solitude because
[18771.08s -> 18779.80s]  of a lot of factors and support has some of the highest impact on the game.
[18779.80s -> 18783.68s]  Whereas like ADKRA has high impact of late but in in solitude you want to have high impact
[18783.68s -> 18809.96s]  early and I wanted to be able to impact the game early early on.
[18809.96s -> 18820.92s]  So yeah, sorry about being you know, boring in shit.
[18820.92s -> 18823.28s]  I just really want to win games.
[18824.56s -> 18825.56s]  At least on this account,
[18825.56s -> 18826.60s]  I want to get out of the CLO,
[18826.60s -> 18828.80s]  because the faster I get out of the CLO,
[18828.80s -> 18846.32s]  the faster I can have fun playing 80 carry
[18846.72s -> 18847.84s]  and like, try and climb.
[18849.68s -> 18850.88s]  What a weird.
[18851.92s -> 18853.52s]  Like, what a weird play by these guys.
[18853.52s -> 18854.88s]  What the fuck?
[18854.88s -> 18859.88s]  They like half shoved the waves to get like,
[18859.88s -> 18872.51s]  early bush control, and then they do shit like that.
[18872.51s -> 18884.42s]  This guy's just dead. I'm gonna give it to Twitch. Nice. We got his exhausts. So I wasted my exhaust there. I did it because I thought the jinx was going to insta flash
[18886.38s -> 18893.08s]  Okay, I didn't exhaust because I was like scared of her damage. I did it because I thought she was going to like try and flash away the second that's
[18894.90s -> 18901.02s]  But I I reminded my snare it was kind of bad by me. I mean I landed my snare. I didn't need to exhaust or I just was like, oh, maybe she'll flash
[18901.70s -> 18903.70s]  She did not she did not flash
[18903.70s -> 18911.14s]  what he was this this is 500 LP masters 400 LP in saying I know
[18911.14s -> 18937.97s]  absolutely crazy put that word there because Greg is probably bot yeah
[18937.97s -> 18954.02s]  so they're trying to come up from bot to kill me here like their bot names
[18954.02s -> 18961.06s]  rotating up to try and kill me so just be careful twitch they're in here man
[18961.06s -> 18963.06s]  I
[18963.06s -> 18976.40s]  Actually have to back and walk look. This is hilarious the enemy bobbin literally is roaming mid. Look at this
[18977.20s -> 18981.08s]  What's why?
[18981.08s -> 18992.25s]  I'm not trying to soak his XP I just want those souls. I'm scared to walk in here
[18992.25s -> 19008.15s]  I don't know where Greg is is I got to come bot to help my twitch so they don't freeze the wave
[19008.67s -> 19013.53s]  Like I don't want them to be able to freeze here
[19015.64s -> 19023.23s]  Even if Bragg is ganks we win we win the fight right now like it's an easy fight win as long as we don't get knocked up
[19023.23s -> 19035.12s]  We just went the fight automatically. I actually I'm we're trying to bait Gragges to come gank this
[19043.32s -> 19044.68s]  Easy
[19044.68s -> 19046.68s]  Double flashes baby easy
[19047.88s -> 19069.06s]  You fucking cowards. We should back up like I can go buy now. Oh, Gragges is top
[19069.66s -> 19071.66s]  We could actually maybe do dragon
[19071.86s -> 19078.34s]  Yo, I'm gonna be real a soul roaming is not a not in like the top list of me being like nervous about it
[19079.30s -> 19082.68s]  Like I'm not nervous about a soul roaming men
[19082.68s -> 19092.52s]  What's this so we can over-diving them that's a bit scary welcome to the league of
[19092.52s -> 19098.52s]  Draven good to see your back to enjoying the game oh we're going to still diving
[19098.52s -> 19101.52s]  That that's not good like we back off here man
[19101.52s -> 19116.44s]  I mean we can maybe go up here if you really want to I kind of reward this
[19116.44s -> 19125.24s]  I need to reset the really badly right now
[19125.24s -> 19131.17s]  Really badly
[19131.17s -> 19142.17s]  I'm not being on the map here, is really bad, or rather not like having gold spent and being on the map is what I meant to say, like it's a really fucking bad.
[19142.17s -> 19151.17s]  Yo, back up. You know Greg is that you watched him walk past three warms. That's why I just ordered. No, no, he's still here.
[19151.17s -> 19153.17s]  Ragass is right there
[19154.25s -> 19158.13s]  Like we we know Greg is just somewhere bot lane right now. I don't know where but we know he's there
[19158.65s -> 19167.31s]  They're on dragon. Okay, we can fight this go. We go
[19168.27s -> 19186.61s]  W over I'm here nice. Yeah, come here
[19188.15s -> 19190.91s]  Yeah, I'll help you come get the move first blue
[19192.83s -> 19228.22s]  I got you baby what the fuck made a bitch oh I guess I'll back
[19230.10s -> 19238.62s]  Yo Spartan, thank you for the six months man. Welcome back. We'll get our fucking umbral
[19240.06s -> 19244.70s]  I'm gonna go top side of the map now and I'm gonna help my team get rift heralds
[19245.70s -> 19248.42s]  I'm gonna paint I want to go top side. I want to help my team get rifts
[19249.14s -> 19262.10s]  The wave if we look at bot wave it's pushing into us. It's totally fine. Okay, okay, which is level six
[19262.10s -> 19274.07s]  The bot wave is pushing in, we are totally fine to do what I'm doing right now.
[19274.07s -> 19275.55s]  He doesn't know I'm here.
[19275.55s -> 19293.57s]  I'm dead though.
[19293.57s -> 19297.23s]  Rhoho.
[19297.23s -> 19300.75s]  No joke, I almost juked that.
[19300.75s -> 19302.07s]  That's so close.
[19302.07s -> 19305.95s]  I was hoping, like, we'll call him for some reason, didn't walk top time.
[19305.95s -> 19309.11s]  Uh, but the enemy bot lane dead?
[19309.11s -> 19315.67s]  Okay, the enemy bot lane just grief their entire game.
[19315.67s -> 19317.47s]  The game's over, we win.
[19317.47s -> 19319.47s]  What the fuck are they doing? What is happening?
[19321.97s -> 19323.97s]  Like my twitch is just getting free plates
[19329.90s -> 19340.78s]  Wait, you guys are griefing. I'm griefing
[19341.82s -> 19343.82s]  Dude, what the fuck
[19343.98s -> 19348.82s]  We why would you fight them guys guys guys? We'll con
[19350.06s -> 19356.92s]  We'll con okay, we see that our twitch is getting free plates, but free first to it. Okay, I'm back
[19356.92s -> 19366.84s]  I almost sold their 80 carry, okay, or their jungler. Why would you ever on purpose take a four-off fight like that with no
[19367.48s -> 19369.48s]  Oh, I've cancer
[19369.48s -> 19371.48s]  I also
[19371.48s -> 19376.20s]  The Wukong's an idiot. He doesn't understand macro at all apparently because I literally
[19376.92s -> 19380.04s]  Pings to come to ref my Wukong was like nervous
[19383.12s -> 19386.88s]  Like for some reason Wukong didn't walk top. He sat bot trying to gank
[19386.88s -> 19389.38s]  But the objective was Rift, not...
[19391.38s -> 19393.38s]  God, I'm losing my mind in the C.O.
[19393.38s -> 19398.88s]  Master's players are literally just diamond players with slightly better mechanics.
[19398.88s -> 19403.38s]  They don't know anything about the game, and I'm about my brains about to explode like a peanut.
[19403.38s -> 19409.20s]  It's not about them leaning to V2, you fucking come-quat.
[19410.20s -> 19412.70s]  Dude, I know they can't leaning against us to V2.
[19412.70s -> 19414.20s]  It's not about the 2V2, man.
[19414.20s -> 19417.70s]  We get a free ref-terald because we shut down their bot lane,
[19417.70s -> 19420.94s]  And I'm on an item spike so we just automatically get a free rift
[19421.42s -> 19428.29s]  It has nothing to do with 2v2 this come quad mother fucker
[19429.07s -> 19437.07s]  I don't know why that's my insult the pedestrian guy got to me
[19439.15s -> 19447.84s]  Somehow
[19447.84s -> 19449.84s]  Where the fuck is this Warren? Oh
[19450.12s -> 19460.84s]  Cuz I'm telling you right now my macro there was a hundred percent correct by the way like 1,000 percent
[19471.09s -> 19475.45s]  Or even though I died I know it was correct. No, no, just do dragon do not die
[19476.53s -> 19479.83s]  Guys, we don't have to not everything's about kills not everything's about kills. We got this
[19481.05s -> 19485.77s]  Like you don't need to die if you don't need to die of always you don't need to see it killed be like, ooh monkey kill Brando
[19486.13s -> 19492.41s]  Like the game is about like getting objectives on timers and playing off of tempo and things like that
[19492.73s -> 19493.73s]  Like
[19493.73s -> 19501.93s]  There were only reason we even lost Rift was because my Wukong went full monkey brand and was like, no, we need to not play for this Rift with a giant massively
[19503.09s -> 19528.39s]  Wait, kill this guy
[19528.39s -> 19530.39s]  One of my watching right now
[19531.79s -> 19550.56s]  This is outrageous my Wukong is solo altered there. Dude. I'm gonna lose it my Wukong is solo altered their Gregus on a good note though
[19551.88s -> 19554.80s]  They don't get any plates off of riffing so it's not that bad
[19556.52s -> 19562.37s]  Okay man, just push like do hit the minions like stop my bad
[19563.73s -> 19567.57s]  Sorry, I'm wound up right now, Canon. Okay. I'm gonna wound
[19567.57s -> 19571.61s]  And apologies if I, if I grief, do you mind?
[19571.61s -> 19573.61s]  It's fine.
[19573.61s -> 19577.21s]  So it wound up is fine.
[19577.21s -> 19579.89s]  I just don't like when stuff like that happens.
[19579.89s -> 19583.13s]  I'm a perfectionist and it's my big, oh, I talk about this earlier.
[19583.13s -> 19589.37s]  I'm a perfectionist, my biggest flaw is that I will play the game 100% correctly on
[19589.37s -> 19594.33s]  like tempo and timers, but you can't do that because you got to remember to like your teammates
[19594.33s -> 19595.33s]  or teammates.
[19595.33s -> 19602.80s]  Like, they're not just gonna instantly know exactly what you're what to do.
[19602.80s -> 19617.75s]  We win the guy. Don't just stand here and watch me die, man.
[19617.75s -> 19623.53s]  Holy shit!
[19623.53s -> 19628.53s]  That is... Oh my god. If he had let me die there, I might have screamed.
[19628.53s -> 19632.53s]  Actually screamed out loud in anger.
[19632.53s -> 19639.61s]  Like, dude is watching me kite these people within one inch of my life.
[19639.61s -> 19642.69s]  And instead of like helping or walking up and doing anything, you know what he does?
[19645.13s -> 19647.13s]  He pulls a fucking gross score.
[19650.51s -> 19651.95s]  My man just likes to watch.
[19652.27s -> 19654.91s]  It's on the wrong with it, but you know, there's time in a place.
[19655.63s -> 19679.04s]  I don't actually want to buy pinks because I don't think we're strong enough that I don't think that we're strong enough that I can actually even defend the pinks right now if I'm being honest like
[19679.92s -> 19684.00s]  We should be strong enough, but we kind of throw away when I overforce the refs
[19684.52s -> 19685.52s]  so I
[19685.52s -> 19700.24s]  Being I think we need to push this wave so that we can get tempo and move around the map
[19700.76s -> 19703.48s]  Prale sorry I keep saying the wrong thing
[19709.80s -> 19712.12s]  That guy's dead. I have to ditch that guy
[19713.28s -> 19717.12s]  Is that his fuck I'm dead to maybe I'm so dead
[19718.28s -> 19724.76s]  Yeah, that was my bad that was my bad my bad my bad my bad like we just got we just got ran down. That was on me
[19724.76s -> 19733.94s]  like we we had good positioning but the jungler wasn't close enough so this
[19733.94s -> 19739.94s]  my gun. I also didn't expect to get fucking 4 man's but I should have
[19739.94s -> 19746.41s]  right we should play for this though. I wish I could type I wish I wasn't
[19746.41s -> 19753.05s]  chat restricted for a year. Dude I swear to god I'm not even being mean like
[19753.05s -> 19757.45s]  Riot was like they chat restricted me because I type so much macro that it
[19757.45s -> 19765.09s]  gets on people's nerves and they don't want to be spam typing.
[19765.09s -> 19766.09s]  Low key.
[19766.09s -> 19768.09s]  Don't play for Rifts.
[19768.09s -> 19779.43s]  I need help, guys.
[19779.43s -> 19781.43s]  If you guys can help.
[19781.43s -> 19784.43s]  We need the clear vision on Dragon.
[19784.43s -> 19795.19s]  A year?
[19795.19s -> 19796.19s]  Yeah.
[19796.19s -> 19797.19s]  I get on chat.
[19797.19s -> 19801.19s]  It starts at April 15th or April 11th or some shit.
[19801.19s -> 19803.19s]  2,024.
[19803.19s -> 19805.19s]  I've never seen it.
[19805.19s -> 19808.19s]  It must have been like an actual riot or something.
[19808.19s -> 19811.19s]  Like, I've never seen an automated system give you a year chat restricts, right?
[19811.19s -> 19814.99s]  Shat restricts right so in my mind it's got to be like an actual like
[19817.54s -> 19819.30s]  Like a rioter was like dronimo
[19820.58s -> 19823.24s]  We know you're good enough to climb but stop typing
[19824.62s -> 19834.35s]  You know I mean that's like what must have been going on and I'm like okay, well
[19835.47s -> 19852.22s]  Sure, I
[19852.22s -> 19854.22s]  I didn't know you could get chat band a year
[19854.48s -> 19859.52s]  What's weird is like I said I don't like say trigger words. It's not like I tell people to like end themselves and stuff
[19859.52s -> 19865.08s]  It's mainly just me typing like go here do that do this like I type a lot, right?
[19865.08s -> 19869.04s]  Which is obviously like if you type a lot, it can be toxic as well, so
[19872.82s -> 19874.74s]  Like typing a lot to knowing so I get it
[19886.21s -> 19893.37s]  We should be playing for barren side vision right now. Not the vision we're playing with right now is bad. We should be playing over here
[19895.13s -> 19899.17s]  Like I want to play for barren vision, but it's a little hard to do that right now
[19899.17s -> 19907.90s]  Because you see how Tom Kenshin me or like transferring vision control around the map right now
[19908.62s -> 19914.32s]  We're playing this little support game of like hide the vision look at this fuck
[19915.32s -> 19918.76s]  Look at this motherfucker
[19931.02s -> 19933.26s]  Oh, he's so dumb. I
[19941.68s -> 19952.79s]  Still think he's dumb. How do I just take
[19952.79s -> 19966.44s]  Didn't I took my entire HP bar on a global my bad dude
[19966.44s -> 19968.40s]  I really wish the mouth fight would group though
[19968.40s -> 19969.92s]  I
[19969.92s -> 19973.32s]  Get these like do in the thing where he's like, oh, let's you know split
[19973.32s -> 19976.00s]  I like his play was actually really smart there
[19976.56s -> 19980.56s]  The mouth fights play I'm in like that wasn't his fault that we got shit on at all
[19980.56s -> 19985.48s]  I just wish that he would group because if he groups up and hits our we went every team fight
[19985.48s -> 19989.48s]  because right now our only frontliner is the WooCong, right?
[19989.48s -> 19991.48s]  And the fact that WooCong's our frontliner,
[19991.48s -> 19993.48s]  we don't have the ability to play the game.
[19994.48s -> 19997.48s]  When I get stuck on that, what the fuck was that?
[19997.48s -> 20000.48s]  Like that Tom Kinch, getting to eat forward like that,
[20000.48s -> 20004.48s]  blindly into our entire team, and then not getting punished for it,
[20004.48s -> 20007.48s]  might be the most like solo queue thing I've ever seen.
[20007.48s -> 20009.48s]  Nobody wanted to hit him because he was the tank,
[20009.48s -> 20014.48s]  but, uh, yeah, that's, we should still kill him, you know?
[20015.48s -> 20028.13s]  We can fight this guy. Oh my god jungle or just come. Oh, we're forfeiting. Okay, that makes perfect sense, right?
[20030.33s -> 20038.85s]  Just come group. Bro can and come group please guys like I don't know why everybody's frustrated. We're literally still up in gold
[20039.69s -> 20041.89s]  Please come group up. We just took it inhibitor
[20042.77s -> 20044.77s]  Just just come group
[20044.77s -> 20048.77s]  how to make it vision on the dragon so that I don't so we don't die
[20048.77s -> 20052.77s]  like I need my team to actually walk over here to help me get vision
[20052.77s -> 20058.52s]  it's really frustrating because I need the front liners the woocon in the
[20058.52s -> 20063.24s]  mouth I had to walk in with me because I'm a little fucking why I have a big gun
[20063.24s -> 20067.56s]  but I'm a big gun girl right so I need I need these two guys to walk in with me
[20067.56s -> 20076.00s]  these two big burly mountain men so that I can play the game you know
[20076.00s -> 20082.28s]  no we don't push bot no no no no no no no no no no no no no mad no bot is worthless
[20082.28s -> 20087.12s]  come in my mouth i'm pushing the wave that we already have down i wish i could
[20087.12s -> 20091.80s]  macro i wish I could type some macro right now they're there in a way my team is so
[20091.80s -> 20100.17s]  lost there's so beyond the lost right now it's crazy there's lost this shit
[20100.17s -> 20112.26s]  just dude dude dragon yes just do this just dude i'll start it for you here you
[20112.26s -> 20117.26s]  I don't know why we're standing in a bush waiting for them to face check, do dragon guess.
[20117.26s -> 20126.38s]  I swear to God, you have to do everything in the zealot where you have to start every fight.
[20126.38s -> 20129.38s]  I have to basically have to start every fight, right?
[20129.38s -> 20134.38s]  I have to not only start every fight but I have to ping my team what to do exactly.
[20134.38s -> 20137.38s]  Because everybody plays so safe in the zealot.
[20137.38s -> 20140.38s]  Why did my mouth fight just stop his back?
[20140.38s -> 20143.38s]  Why are you all fighting?
[20143.38s -> 20148.87s]  Oh my god, please guys.
[20148.87s -> 20153.91s]  Guys, it's fine, it's fine.
[20155.55s -> 20157.75s]  No, mouth fight, you can't one be nine that.
[20157.75s -> 20159.75s]  Just back off, they didn't get anything.
[20159.75s -> 20161.55s]  They didn't get anything, we got dragon.
[20161.55s -> 20163.03s]  We're on dragon's soul points.
[20164.95s -> 20166.63s]  I'm losing hairs.
[20166.63s -> 20167.99s]  I'm losing fucking hairs, man.
[20167.99s -> 20170.27s]  I ain't got many hairs to spare anymore.
[20170.27s -> 20177.58s]  We're out here, losing hair.
[20177.58s -> 20179.22s]  I'm babysitting, like this has got to be
[20179.22s -> 20181.66s]  what a preschool teacher feels like, you know?
[20181.66s -> 20183.98s]  Like a low key, like preschool teacher
[20183.98s -> 20191.58s]  just feels like this, this has to be it.
[20191.58s -> 20194.98s]  Like watching a toddler, like you watch them from the corner, right?
[20194.98s -> 20196.62s]  And they're like eating glue.
[20196.62s -> 20198.22s]  And you're like,
[20198.22s -> 20199.02s]  I mean, that's mad.
[20199.02s -> 20201.58s]  And then you tell them, like, don't eat glue to me.
[20201.58s -> 20202.78s]  And he's like, okay.
[20202.78s -> 20204.42s]  And then like, you're eating that for five minutes
[20204.42s -> 20206.70s]  to go like, do something that into watch somebody else
[20206.70s -> 20208.34s]  then all of a sudden Timmy's eating glue again.
[20208.34s -> 20210.82s]  And you're like, bro, bro.
[20211.82s -> 20221.03s]  We just had this discussion.
[20221.03s -> 20222.55s]  And it's like, not Timmy's fault, right?
[20222.55s -> 20223.63s]  Because he's a toddler.
[20224.79s -> 20227.19s]  So you can't be mad at Timmy because he's a toddler.
[20227.19s -> 20228.19s]  You can't.
[20228.19s -> 20229.59s]  But it's like it's frustrating.
[20229.59s -> 20242.36s]  It's like, God damn it, man.
[20242.36s -> 20243.32s]  Like what is happening?
[20243.32s -> 20244.92s]  Like, mouth-eye, just group.
[20244.92s -> 20248.60s]  My mouth-eye has a fetish with just pushing bot.
[20248.60s -> 20249.96s]  Bro, just group and hit R.
[20251.60s -> 20254.60s]  Bro, I know you have Bork.
[20254.60s -> 20257.90s]  Wait, you have Bork?
[20257.90s -> 20262.58s]  Well, bro, we need to be able to engage.
[20262.58s -> 20263.70s]  We don't win through split.
[20264.78s -> 20266.30s]  Just group up and R, and we win.
[20267.82s -> 20269.70s]  Like I've been controlling the ever-loving fuck out
[20269.70s -> 20271.50s]  of all the vision this game.
[20271.50s -> 20275.82s]  I feel like I'm doing all of this to control vision and shit, and it still feels like it's not enough.
[20276.82s -> 20277.62s]  It's kind of nuts.
[20281.21s -> 20283.57s]  Okay, it still feels not enough.

[20294.91s -> 20295.47s]  Get me!
[20304.51s -> 20306.27s]  They don't have a word, they don't know I'm there.
[20315.02s -> 20316.42s]  Well, we're just not gonna old-deck out or what?
[20322.22s -> 20324.82s]  This is why you we listen.
[20326.10s -> 20330.42s]  Oh my god, I have, I actually just, I'm so, I don't know what to say.
[20330.42s -> 20334.42s]  Like I literally pinged to come, Wukong didn't use Ulti,
[20334.42s -> 20339.42s]  Twitch just died in, and now he's at FK. Oh my god, oh my god, kill me in game.
[20339.42s -> 20354.65s]  Kenan and Malfi, can you guys do anything? Like, bro, can we, can we, like, just go in, Kenan just Ulti?
[20354.65s -> 20382.21s]  Okay guys, we get, we get Baron here, like the enemy team through, go to Baron.
[20382.21s -> 20386.21s]  Please, please go Baron.
[20386.21s -> 20394.08s]  Please, we get Soul and Baron here.
[20394.08s -> 20402.75s]  Dude, I swear to God, these people are not real.
[20407.24s -> 20408.84s]  Bro, we do not need the mouth fight.
[20410.44s -> 20412.04s]  I am a higher level than my jungler.
[20416.78s -> 20418.78s]  Push mid. Guys, you got to push mid first.
[20419.78s -> 20421.78s]  Listen, homies, you got to push mid first.
[20425.89s -> 20428.49s]  You know what, fuck it. Don't even go in. Yeah, fuck it. Push mid.
[20429.49s -> 20430.49s]  We're just going to end the game.
[20431.09s -> 20433.49s]  If they go for dragon here, we just, we just push. Fuck it.
[20438.89s -> 20441.29s]  That's actually such a good macro call. Not even joking.
[20454.36s -> 20455.56s]  Such a good macro call, actually.
[20455.76s -> 20466.90s]  everybody just run though just run don't don't oldie in no guys we don't fight this
[20466.90s -> 20475.18s]  whole I have cancer we're getting flanks boys dude I have such high levels of cancer right now
[20475.18s -> 20514.32s]  you have no idea like I I fucking functioning cancer you guys just kill the fucking
[20514.32s -> 20523.33s]  Gregus? Oh my god, thank god. Thank god, just end the game. Please end the game. Please hit the fucking thick.
[20525.73s -> 20532.77s]  Oh my god. Walter White is like my hero right now. I don't even understand. Like I feel like
[20532.77s -> 20539.41s]  every like I feel like what Walter White felt like dealing with Skyler for literally three years like this is outrageous
[20539.41s -> 20547.82s]  this. This is what this feels like. Like I can relate to the show so much more. Oh my god,
[20550.51s -> 20582.34s]  like dude, I, oh crap. They're the look it, just look at the like, look at like what's going on in
[20582.34s -> 20593.60s]  the game. Like I don't even mean to be mean about this. It's just this is crazy.
[20593.60s -> 20599.13s]  Malfight though, pop and off.
[20599.13s -> 20609.99s]  Malfight, pop and off.
[20609.99s -> 20613.87s]  Like what do you use this guy?
[20613.87s -> 20619.94s]  He's literally diamond.
[20619.94s -> 20621.38s]  Why is this guy in this game?
[20621.38s -> 20624.06s]  I mean, I feel like confused now.
[20624.06s -> 20625.50s]  I'm not even blaming the Wu-Kong anymore.
[20625.50s -> 20627.14s]  I don't know why this guy is in the game.
[20628.30s -> 20634.99s]  Oh, he hasn't played to that seminar.
[20634.99s -> 20638.31s]  Oh, he just has previous season and played to the MMR.
[20638.31s -> 20639.51s]  That's what this is.
[20639.51s -> 20642.35s]  Because he was GM for three years.
[20642.35s -> 20646.11s]  So the his MMR says that he like belongs here even though he doesn't play like I bet you
[20646.11s -> 20652.96s]  last season he only played like 50 games I can look right we can see like I'm a games
[20652.96s -> 20658.32s]  he played yeah he played like 50 games last season so like his MMR didn't really change he
[20658.32s -> 20671.18s]  just got masters and then stopped which is fine there's only one with that's I just wish
[20671.18s -> 20679.77s]  he would chill you know like uh not rage quit halfway through the game because I
[20679.77s -> 20682.73s]  I was like, is that people's elo and shit used to bother me a lot?
[20682.73s -> 20685.57s]  I don't get bothered by any more because I realized that it was cringe.
[20685.57s -> 20687.01s]  I don't care about their elo and shit.
[20687.01s -> 20689.17s]  What I care about is like, I just want them to play the game.
[20689.17s -> 20690.17s]  You know what I mean?
[20690.17s -> 20694.33s]  Like, I just want them to not rage, not like the absolute apes in the game and just play.
[20694.33s -> 20696.01s]  That's all I ask for.
[20696.01s -> 20697.77s]  I don't care if you're a time of player plot player on the game,
[20697.77s -> 20699.05s]  and you're just like, accidentally in the game.
[20699.05s -> 20700.17s]  I guess that you're fault.
[20700.17s -> 20705.79s]  I just want you to push buttons.
[20705.79s -> 20711.60s]  What I'm doing wrong to have a 36% one, right?
[20711.60s -> 20718.25s]  I can't see the link because you don't have to give me your name and your server.
[20718.25s -> 20719.17s]  How are you guys doing, by the way?
[20719.17s -> 20720.53s]  Everybody having a good day?
[20720.53s -> 20722.93s]  You guys enjoying the stream, having a good time?
[20722.93s -> 20726.13s]  Watching me go bald in live, like, live time.
[20726.13s -> 20727.13s]  You guys are like, oh, what?
[20727.13s -> 20728.97s]  Drawin' the most going bald live on stream.
[20728.97s -> 20732.81s]  I'm like, yeah, it's rough.
[20732.81s -> 20734.21s]  Hold on, I'm gonna take my pants off.
[20773.85s -> 20776.77s]  Dude, what, I, I, fuck you guys.
[20777.89s -> 20780.93s]  They fucking, I got double swapped, did you get to see that shit?
[20780.93s -> 20782.33s]  They're like, oh, yeah, the support could do it.
[20782.33s -> 20783.61s]  And then he banned Santa.
[20783.61s -> 20788.61s]  I mean, I didn't hover it, so that's my bad God damn it.
[20788.61s -> 20793.88s]  I should have hovered, I was just like taking my pants off.
[20793.88s -> 20795.88s]  And now he wants first pick.
[20795.88s -> 20802.89s]  Dude, what? Oh my God, I don't know, I don't know what to say.
[20802.89s -> 20811.15s]  This is crazy. Today's Thursday, right?
[20811.15s -> 20814.15s]  I mean, my losing days. Today's Thursday, right guys?
[20814.15s -> 20825.18s]  It is? Okay, cool.
[20825.18s -> 20829.32s]  Oh, what do I play there, Zareth, and Zinn?
[20829.32s -> 20840.89s]  I'm gonna say I just play with Con, it's something to...
[20840.89s -> 20842.25s]  Let's see what their bow-wain is though.
[20842.25s -> 20848.64s]  I actually have to see what their bow-wain is, the twos my runes.
[20848.64s -> 20850.64s]  So no, no.
[20850.64s -> 20853.04s]  Oh, they have an Ezreal.
[20853.04s -> 20856.00s]  The fuck is their team comp?
[20856.00s -> 20858.95s]  Okay.
[20858.95s -> 20882.39s]  When you do this build, what's the second area supposed to be?
[20882.39s -> 20889.47s]  I think it's supposed to be this, or maybe, like, revitalize?
[20889.47s -> 20896.32s]  I just felt like I'm flinching so good. Oh, they have a support,
[20896.32s -> 20901.76s]  grrrrr, Xareth. So, support is that, yeah, yeah, okay, so I want, uh, I definitely want
[20901.76s -> 20908.68s]  Glacier here, and I want... Maybe I take MR actually instead of armor, because they have
[20908.68s -> 20918.76s]  two Pokechamps, and I take this. Yeah, yeah, this is good. Okay, that's not bad. Okay, once
[20918.76s -> 20920.76s]  I'll be right back. I need to get some more water.
[20987.33s -> 20989.33s]  Oh shit, no, don't flag me.
[20991.33s -> 20992.33s]  Fuck man, I had a pee.
[20993.33s -> 20996.33s]  Fucking flagged me for AFK, cause I didn't take a leak.
[20996.33s -> 21001.90s]  Can you not start with 80 carry the move over to support? I always fall asleep before the 80 carry gameplay.
[21002.90s -> 21005.90s]  Wait, what? I fell asleep before 80 carry.
[21005.90s -> 21011.34s]  what do you mean oh you mean like start with my main and then play
[21011.34s -> 21030.77s]  yeah I played 80 carry at the start I should probably play 80 carry more
[21030.77s -> 21036.81s]  over support later in the stream they're all playing 80 carry game
[21036.81s -> 21060.02s]  Methodist. I feel bad. Oh, it's Gragas. I thought it was gonna be Zara, but it's Gragas. I
[21063.91s -> 21068.39s]  Don't want to fight too hard level one even though that that I should have gone in there. That's my bad
[21068.91s -> 21072.67s]  I want to I want to try and get level two here even though I think we actually win level one
[21073.67s -> 21079.44s]  Oh, I got his phone pointing. Yeah, I should have fought level one. That was my bad
[21080.48s -> 21083.08s]  Because we went very hard level one. I just grieved it
[21084.28s -> 21088.62s]  Like all I have to do there is go in on the Ezreal or the Gragas of a one and they can't play the game
[21089.24s -> 21091.24s]  right
[21091.24s -> 21110.28s]  it's not worth it's not worth
[21110.28s -> 21115.59s]  there's no way that I cannot get eat by Gregor's there by the way
[21115.59s -> 21122.12s]  like I don't know if I can flash the other
[21122.12s -> 21131.74s]  maybe we shouldn't be egoing buddy
[21131.74s -> 21139.74s]  guys just fucking egos in front of me like what
[21139.74s -> 21157.51s]  okay I might have missed everything there but like
[21157.51s -> 21171.70s]  you know that's okay
[21171.70s -> 21173.70s]  It's a little counterproductive
[21175.30s -> 21178.02s]  When I take a tower shot to land a queue
[21179.54s -> 21181.54s]  Feels a little counterproductive
[21188.85s -> 21199.14s]  But hey, I'm gonna back here just in case the enemy is in tries to get in command
[21201.81s -> 21212.15s]  Dude, I'm so sad I can't get boots. I'm gonna wait. Yeah, I'm gonna be cringe. I'm gonna wait
[21212.95s -> 21217.19s]  I would never wait here normally, but you know what it's just it's so like it's such a big buy
[21218.47s -> 21227.47s]  I don't want to I'm I'm now that now that I've waited and beat cringe now I have to set here in weights. Oh, it's so painful. Okay, I'm going.
[21227.47s -> 21229.47s]  I'm sorry, I guess.
[21229.47s -> 21249.59s]  Worked the way. Not at all.
[21249.59s -> 21269.73s]  I got lucky, but you know what's interesting. I never use the stupid dematerializer.
[21269.73s -> 21278.73s]  I think I should have like I should use it on every can and or some shit, but I just don't do it because I know the reason you're supposed to use it is because it helps you push.
[21278.73s -> 21281.61s]  Because you can demon materialize the cannon right and just instant yeah
[21282.45s -> 21285.29s]  So you're supposed to use it because it's like a really fast way to push but it's also a
[21286.57s -> 21305.20s]  I should not have w and fuck I
[21305.20s -> 21310.08s]  Well, not the gragas anyway. I fucked up. I shouldn't have done read the gragas. It should put it soar
[21312.73s -> 21314.73s]  This guy is gonna die
[21316.33s -> 21319.37s]  Oh, he's gonna die put himself against the wall. GG
[21321.69s -> 21323.69s]  That was my fault though 100%
[21323.69s -> 21333.00s]  Because if I didn't W in they can't kill us right and Greg is probably dies to the auto attack anyway
[21333.28s -> 21336.44s]  My thought process was Greg is snared so if I W here
[21336.84s -> 21340.92s]  But even after like even if I don't get eat I'm pretty confident I die
[21377.43s -> 21388.06s]  Amid I tried I was out of everything I wonder if I could have played that better
[21388.62s -> 21391.42s]  Maybe like if I could have weaved an extra auto in or something
[21392.54s -> 21394.54s]  I don't know
[21394.82s -> 21414.00s]  It's hard to know all right. I'm gonna go mid here
[21415.20s -> 21418.88s]  I can't, okay.
[21418.88s -> 21424.72s]  Like, who'd go mid, but I think I, I think I want to say bot for a bit and get some XP.
[21424.72s -> 21429.99s]  I think it's smarter to do that at this point.
[21429.99s -> 21448.28s]  I think we should push this.
[21448.28s -> 21451.28s]  I don't want to W in because I know it's in Seria.
[21451.28s -> 21454.28s]  That's why I didn't want to W because I know it's in Seria.
[21454.28s -> 21470.75s]  They were just making it so obvious, right?
[21470.75s -> 21472.75s]  Like, that it was like,
[21472.75s -> 21475.75s]  sometimes when people make shit too good to be true,
[21475.75s -> 21478.75s]  it is too good to be true.
[21478.75s -> 21481.71s]  Like oh shit, we're just gonna they're just gonna fight us here cool. Oh
[21483.43s -> 21489.86s]  Yeah, I gotta help him push. I bet I'm playing sloppy
[21515.54s -> 21523.67s]  You just wanna see a cool trick watch us she could push the wave and then just min max the back
[21525.47s -> 21534.24s]  How cool is that she just pushes the wave and I just back next to the bush and she's just like, oh, I guess I'll take the free ride
[21534.24s -> 21563.12s]  I really need level six badly like bro
[21563.12s -> 21565.92s]  I really cannot get level six right now. This is
[21567.20s -> 21573.77s]  painful
[21573.77s -> 21576.09s]  Kill these maybe I'm six of this nope guess not I
[21577.29s -> 21580.33s]  Was gonna stay mid there by the way and help the home me
[21581.69s -> 21612.59s]  I need to go mid
[21612.59s -> 21627.87s]  This is so awkward
[21627.87s -> 21636.04s]  Bro help me
[21636.04s -> 21641.16s]  Bro like you got to walk to me like I can't like my Eve is like here
[21641.72s -> 21643.72s]  I'm way over here
[21643.72s -> 21651.73s]  right in my eaves like yo, homie, like dude I'm like we're trying to push the way
[21651.73s -> 21660.47s]  even for her and she's just not accepting to wait and I can't double you the
[21660.47s -> 21663.57s]  wall I mean I guess I could double you the wall because I was trying to walk
[21663.57s -> 21667.33s]  around right I saw her in trouble when I was here so I wanted her to walk towards
[21667.33s -> 21671.81s]  here so I could e-over the wall that was my thought process e-over the wall
[21671.81s -> 21675.93s]  helped the guy but you like didn't understand that and I just got shit on and it
[21675.93s -> 21687.37s]  felt really bad. Both our solos are getting absolutely shit on. This is very bad.
[21688.49s -> 21696.96s]  Because I don't know how to help our team at this stage. Like I'm just always behind on tempo
[21696.96s -> 21726.44s]  now around the map in the wrong spot at the wrong time. This is so awkward. I have a
[21726.44s -> 21756.57s]  whole week of kill this guy. We could maybe kill a Zen if I sneak in here, push the way, push the way
[21756.57s -> 21757.41s]  Oh my, hurry.
[21758.77s -> 21776.00s]  He's got a crash it.
[21776.00s -> 21781.14s]  I mean, this guy's just dead.
[21781.14s -> 21783.18s]  My 80 carry is gonna get fucked for it though,
[21783.18s -> 21785.34s]  so I hope it was worth.
[21785.34s -> 21793.76s]  Like my 80 carry is gonna get zones.
[21793.76s -> 21796.68s]  It's really hard to tell if anything like that's worth sometimes
[21796.68s -> 21800.48s]  because I used my old before a dragon fight.
[21800.48s -> 21801.60s]  We're gonna lose bot tower.
[21801.60s -> 21802.96s]  There's just so many factors, right?
[21802.96s -> 21804.44s]  It's so far.
[21804.44s -> 21826.04s]  And now I don't have words, oh, it's so rough.
[21826.04s -> 21827.44s]  Oh, I got the ignite off, but dude,
[21827.44s -> 21836.44s]  Can't put that Gregus lived. No. Oh, I had stopwatch. I have stopwatch. Oh my god, I'm the worst player in existence.
[21836.44s -> 21851.27s]  I actually have the ability to live there. Oh, no. I should sell my magic and shame. I actually just want the item, so.
[21851.27s -> 21853.27s]  I'm
[21853.27s -> 21855.27s]  so bad
[21855.27s -> 21859.27s]  due to dragons is low key a good pick versus Rakan though you can stop his engage so easily
[21859.27s -> 21869.98s]  it's actually low key a good pick
[21869.98s -> 21938.68s]  bro nice not that I kind of want to back off here you don't feel it's kind of bad
[21938.68s -> 21942.68s]  he has noticed that I just I got my
[21942.68s -> 21945.68s]  I don't know if you guys noticed this but I got my fucking
[21945.68s -> 21956.85s]  I got like four assists just now, but it was after I sold my mages. How fucking bad does that feel?
[21958.05s -> 21966.44s]  Like actually oh, by the way, I want to ask you guys
[21968.32s -> 21978.79s]  What 80 carry do you guys think is the most sought out for people to learn right now like what would you say is like people want to learn
[21979.07s -> 21983.01s]  This 80 carry over other 80 carries. What do you guys think?
[21983.77s -> 21999.16s]  my man says Timo okay make sense got it depends yeah I'm just trying to wonder
[21999.16s -> 22005.20s]  like what um people would want to watch or what people would want to learn
[22005.20s -> 22008.88s]  specifically so I know everybody plays different shit but I know there's also like
[22008.88s -> 22024.16s]  popular shit you know okay I'm just bad he's bad too we listen we're bad for bad
[22024.16s -> 22025.16s]  I guess.
[22025.16s -> 22072.35s]  Oh, not bad.
[22072.35s -> 22074.35s]  Genolutions, I affiliates.
[22074.35s -> 22076.35s]  Damn, is it like just that different?
[22076.35s -> 22078.35s]  Like a lot of people like different stuff?
[22078.35s -> 22090.48s]  Because I've always just thought, like, oh, no.
[22090.48s -> 22093.48s]  I guess I've always just thought that people like, um,
[22093.48s -> 22099.43s]  a lot of people really like meta 80 carriers or like really playmaking 80 carriers, right?
[22099.43s -> 22102.43s]  Like, jinx is probably the best 80 carry in the meta,
[22102.43s -> 22106.43s]  but I don't say a lot of people ever ask or like request to watch jinx.
[22106.43s -> 22110.19s]  jinx. You know what I mean? Like jinx is not like she's not like a fun 80
[22110.19s -> 22113.31s]  carrier that people want to learn how to play even though she is like the best
[22113.31s -> 22116.83s]  80. There's like the people who are like oh yeah don't jinx is boring. I got
[22116.83s -> 22119.23s]  want to play gin and like shoot people. I want to play like Lucian and
[22119.23s -> 22121.63s]  Dashran. Like it's like so that's what I'm wondering is like what the
[22121.63s -> 22140.76s]  number one 80 carriers for like people just like enjoy watching. Not bad though.
[22141.56s -> 22148.76s]  Okay, I think we could play an 80 carry game. Down. I- oh you guys an 80 carry game.
[22149.64s -> 22152.20s]  I owe you that much for watching me play support for two hours.
[22152.20s -> 22154.44s]  Actually, I think it was like two and a half hours.
[22154.44s -> 22160.01s]  Yeah, we put four games to support, so it's like two hours.
[22160.01s -> 22170.72s]  Yeah, oh, you guys for, for that, Ziya Irvin.
[22170.72s -> 22171.72s]  Ziya is fun to watch.
[22171.72s -> 22172.72s]  I do like Ziya.
[22172.72s -> 22173.96s]  You'll love Jinks and Kate.
[22173.96s -> 22181.93s]  Oh, there you go.
[22181.93s -> 22186.77s]  You're playing supports, I hope you like to watch her, you carry this plant.
[22186.77s -> 22202.44s]  So that you can, like, better help the homies, got it, got it.
[22202.44s -> 22205.92s]  We need eight wins, I think, from this point we are right now, I think it's eight wins
[22205.92s -> 22217.28s]  to get to grandmaster. I think oops because we're what 370 something, right? Like 360.
[22219.40s -> 22228.12s]  No, we just won. We're not 360. We're like 370. We're 387. Okay, so it's not updated, but what is this?
[22228.52s -> 22240.61s]  Stop. So we need what? Seven wins, net wins to get to GM. I think we can hit GM. I'm a little less
[22240.61s -> 22244.61s]  confident right now about master or about challenger, but I think we can definitely
[22244.61s -> 22257.06s]  hit GM. Like I think I'll get stuck in GM for a bit, unless, unless the games get
[22257.06s -> 22266.08s]  higher quality, I'll be stuck in GM for a little bit, because the thing about the
[22266.08s -> 22270.88s]  thing about the games so far is like the higher quality the games get, the easier
[22270.88s -> 22275.92s]  it actually is to carry if like, if you're a decent player, because the better your
[22275.92s -> 22279.36s]  teammates get, which means that like if you're at that, like say like a
[22279.36s -> 22281.28s]  challenger player will have a better time a challenger, a
[22281.28s -> 22284.88s]  dedicated player carrying in challenger if they get a lead, then
[22284.88s -> 22288.72s]  in diamond if they get a lead. If if that, like, I don't
[22288.72s -> 22291.76s]  that sounds weird to say, but that's it's basically just because
[22291.76s -> 22295.20s]  like when your teammates are better, they enable you better and
[22295.20s -> 22297.76s]  80 carry and all those other roles, when they're being enabled,
[22297.76s -> 22306.42s]  it's a lot easier to play the game. Like if I were to first pick
[22306.42s -> 22310.66s]  jinx in challenger, MMR, there's a good chance my teammates
[22310.66s -> 22315.02s]  would pick stuff that like let's me play jinx right not saying what happened but there's
[22315.02s -> 22318.54s]  like a chance that my teammates would pick something that like they would pick like
[22318.54s -> 22323.22s]  tanks or front liners or some shit right or like Lulu where's like if you picking if you're
[22323.22s -> 22328.06s]  picking jinx first pick and like let's say you guys are gold average like your support might
[22328.06s -> 22331.46s]  just literally pick like first time Velcons or some shit and you're like well this sucks.
[22331.46s -> 22348.51s]  Dude I swear every time I hear the end of this song does anyone who forest within
[22348.51s -> 22355.47s]  is. I swear the guy talking at the end of this song sounds exactly like forced within.
[22357.31s -> 22369.13s]  No joke. Listen to this. Listen to this. That guy who is like saying it was DJ,
[22369.13s -> 22372.65s]  what like, that guy sounded exactly like, I don't know why my brain does that.
[22372.65s -> 22378.89s]  When we sound exactly like forced within, I swear to God, it's actually like perfectly.
[22378.89s -> 22388.49s]  Like if you told me that was him, I would immediately believe you. This guy wants to join the discord.
[22388.49s -> 22404.18s]  Oh, I'm nervous about this shit. It is my support though. So like maybe we could join the discord and like work together a bit
[22404.66s -> 22421.70s]  But I'm also nervous about joining discord calls of people on stream. Well, I don't know
[22422.34s -> 22424.34s]  I don't know if it's worth
[22424.34s -> 22427.38s]  Where would you put Ezreal on the tier list? I think Ezreal's a tier
[22427.90s -> 22433.58s]  I think he could be as tier for solo queue, but he's hard. He's really hard. Ezreal's one of the hardest ladies
[22433.58s -> 22441.26s]  So I would say he's like eight here right now if you're really good at as he is very very very very strong
[22442.06s -> 22444.22s]  But he's also incredibly hard to play
[22445.86s -> 22450.70s]  But he also is not weak in the meta so I give him like strong a
[22452.54s -> 22454.54s]  Like above other a's
[22456.30s -> 22462.74s]  She focused on made supports like brand Xareth or engage like what's not to us it depends on your yellow one of the pens on what you're doing
[22463.58s -> 22479.14s]  I think engage supports in lower yellow are bad. I don't know somebody dodged. I think engage supports in lower yellow are bad personally because I think that
[22481.73s -> 22490.41s]  You can be a really good engage player and it doesn't matter if your team just gets caught over and over again or if you like make it engage your team misplayers
[22490.41s -> 22499.15s]  Right, so it's like if you want to play engage supports do it because they are better than other like engage opponents are better than mages
[22499.15s -> 22503.15s]  But I think in solo queue, majors are better to solo carry.
[22503.15s -> 22504.15s]  So it just depends.
[22504.15s -> 22507.15s]  It depends on your EO and it depends on what you're trying to accomplish, right?
[22507.15s -> 22509.15s]  Because a lot of the time is a support player.
[22509.15s -> 22511.15s]  It's why I play Senna, right?
[22511.15s -> 22516.15s]  Like, I play Senna because I like being able to carry games as support.
[22516.15s -> 22518.15s]  That's why I like Senna.
[22518.15s -> 22524.15s]  Whereas like, if you're a, like if I, like, I can play almost every support, right?
[22524.15s -> 22527.15s]  I can play not on this, I can play, I can play these supports.
[22527.15s -> 22534.83s]  But the problem is is like I feel bad if like I get like it feels really shitty to get people ahead and then have them completely through their reads over and over again
[22534.83s -> 22537.39s]  And then tell them rage and shit. So it feels like dog shit
[22537.83s -> 22548.94s]  So it's nice. It's just like give myself the opportunity to carry it rather than rely 100% on other people, you know, but I would say the number one thing is
[22550.26s -> 22555.14s]  Play what you think is fun. That's just the number one rule like playing if you want to win
[22555.14s -> 22561.74s]  you can play meta, but the problem is if you're showing your face and I'll try to learn a meta champ that you just don't enjoy the place that I love
[22561.94s -> 22566.98s]  You're never gonna actually be good at the champion because you're you're like it's like you're working, right?
[22567.26s -> 22571.26s]  But the best way to learn the champions and learn how to play the game is to have fun
[22571.46s -> 22575.98s]  Because if you're not having fun at some point, you're not gonna be able to learn how to play
[22575.98s -> 22580.34s]  Because you're not gonna be able to put in the hours or put in the games and I'd be focused during the game
[22580.34s -> 22582.82s]  You're gonna be frustrated and if you're frustrated, you're not gonna be learning
[22582.82s -> 22590.66s]  So I always say just play something that's fun. The fun aspect is got to be way more important
[22591.16s -> 22614.12s]  We're gonna music go. Fuck. I'm surprised. Can you guys even hear the music half the time? I have it on so low that I'm not even sure you guys can hear it
[22615.02s -> 22642.40s]  It's just like barely background noise. Is this guy holding swap hostage?
[22644.24s -> 22646.92s]  Join call and I'll swap
[22653.39s -> 22668.20s]  Dude he's holding swap hostage by the way if you guys do like the stream
[22668.20s -> 22674.94s]  Don't forget the follow. You can scroll down to see all my socials, too. Like TikTok, Instagram, all that crap.
[22675.48s -> 22687.46s]  It's all about the stream. There's like links and shit and you know
[22689.14s -> 22708.60s]  A man's got to eat. You can use a Twitch Prime, too. If you want, you know, you're feeling it. I'm going to do a Kisegame. He went box
[22709.84s -> 22718.81s]  But I kind of want to play Kisah. What was the voice? This is what happens when I get close to the mic
[22722.45s -> 22726.41s]  I should put the mic in front of my face more, the mic's like over to the corner.
[22726.41s -> 22728.65s]  So the mic is like really badly, directions.
[22728.65s -> 22759.85s]  Ah, it says a cut-down game, there's, Greg has always used AP, he doesn't go tank,
[22759.85s -> 22760.85s]  he goes like AP.
[22760.85s -> 22782.56s]  I kind of want to go last stand, that's fun, that's just a thing ghost.
[22782.56s -> 22791.43s]  Goes to the one that's so good this game, tried to get with Shield though, it's strong, yeah,
[22791.43s -> 22792.43s]  it's fun, huh?
[22792.43s -> 22796.90s]  I love K with Shield though, it's so fun.
[22796.90s -> 22815.30s]  It's sort of in such a good ghost game, frustrated, oh, I don't know why I wasn't paying attention.
[22815.30s -> 22823.06s]  I always wonder if I should go, part of me always wants to go like, uh, long sort of three against
[22823.06s -> 22828.98s]  Thresh and Zaya but with Kaisa, I feel like you're on really specific timers with Kaisa,
[22828.98s -> 22835.70s]  so you have to go like, it's really important to go, Doran so that you can get the Q upgrade timer
[22835.70s -> 22844.26s]  on the right timing. I've been getting the Q upgrade timer's just so big. Also this game,
[22844.82s -> 22852.10s]  I feel like I go work this game. Second. Borker what's in. If Gregus is not ultra fed,
[22852.10s -> 22866.10s]  I'll probably go work because I don't want to get what's in just for Gregus. Okay, you started Q.
[22875.09s -> 22885.62s]  Oh, Diana's starting on wolves. Okay. I don't think it's some coffee after this game. I'm getting
[22885.62s -> 22907.96s]  It's a rousey. I should have done the middle minion thing. I'm so bad.
[22909.64s -> 22918.36s]  I should have legitimately just done the thing with the minion. So when you know if the rest
[22918.36s -> 22940.47s]  starts hook, you can still play up, right? I can play up, I can play aggressive, I'm bad.
[22941.99s -> 22947.59s]  I should have just killed the thrash. This is really bad, man. We can't help. We can't help.
[22950.26s -> 22953.46s]  Because the way the wave is going, oh, I'm so bad. I fucked up.
[22953.46s -> 22964.68s]  It should be fine, but I still like it where it it foxes over early game because they fucked up very badly
[22965.92s -> 22969.56s]  Like I can't stress enough how badly they just fucked up, but it didn't matter
[22971.24s -> 22974.24s]  Okay, that's that's happening apparently
[22975.52s -> 22991.06s]  Don't worry guys. I'm a bit Zion player or Kai's a player on the server. It's me a con. I am just literally playing white dog shits
[22991.62s -> 23008.88s]  What I picked Kaisa I just felt like playing her
[23014.47s -> 23019.03s]  We got a back. We have to leave the wave in a bad spot. Maybe she can push it, but like we'll
[23019.03s -> 23033.78s]  conks here. So yeah, we just, okay, we got it nice. Not bad. So we had to push the wave in there
[23034.42s -> 23038.26s]  so that the wave will bounce back. But we had to do it on a, it was a really bad timer.
[23038.66s -> 23042.50s]  Let me just say, I fucked up the entire early game of this game. Like this game is I'm so bad.
[23043.70s -> 23047.86s]  Essentially what should have happened was level one when they walked up. When Kyson Thresh walked
[23047.86s -> 23052.42s]  up on the one, we should have killed them. Like I should have just straight up, hit the
[23052.42s -> 23056.42s]  thrush with the locks, because thrush walked into our wave, because Rukong was level two
[23056.42s -> 23061.06s]  ganking. She should have just killed them. I grief that. And because I went for the Ziya instead,
[23061.06s -> 23066.10s]  I put myself in a spot where I took like 80% of my HP for free, right, which put me behind
[23066.10s -> 23070.66s]  and now the entire fight was like harder, because I was low. And then we had to wait for the
[23070.66s -> 23082.73s]  the way it was just it was really bad really that minion actually just did that. I don't
[23082.73s -> 23092.56s]  think we can kill this guy unless she can max range land a queue or something but you know
[23092.56s -> 23098.64s]  is there the best they do right now? No I think Jinx is better. I think Xery is good. Her
[23098.64s -> 23104.16s]  white game especially with like paired with the Janger Xery's insane but I think Jinx is better
[23104.16s -> 23107.16s]  for so much here.
[23107.16s -> 23113.54s]  Oh, I actually have to flash.
[23113.54s -> 23116.54s]  That was a good play hook, but I guess I respected them.
[23116.54s -> 23122.68s]  Hmm, I might have to leave because Wukong can just go here and dive me.
[23122.68s -> 23128.28s]  I actually just have to leave. This feels so bad.
[23128.28s -> 23131.28s]  You see how Wukong just used the plants?
[23131.28s -> 23134.28s]  If I stay, I can just die, right?
[23134.28s -> 23136.28s]  So I'm just misplaying all over the place.
[23136.28s -> 23139.28s]  I'm taking too much damage. We're playing weak side right now, right?
[23139.28s -> 23142.28s]  What I mean by that is like, we know our dionus top,
[23142.28s -> 23146.76s]  top and we know their WooCong's bot. So because of that, I need to play a lot less
[23146.76s -> 23150.52s]  trading. Like I walked up and just let the thrash foie me for free and I missed two
[23150.52s -> 23154.44s]  waves now. I need to not do that because if I don't miss these waves, it doesn't
[23154.44s -> 23163.70s]  matter for weak sighting because I'm not behind. So it's it's just really stupid. Now what I
[23163.70s -> 23167.06s]  do want to do is I want to go check and see if the WooCong's like on our camps or something
[23167.30s -> 23176.96s]  or if he's doing dragon or some shits. I should not have used the blast cone. Dude, I am so bad!
[23176.96s -> 23179.96s]  I used the blast cone to just hit it.
[23179.96s -> 23181.96s]  It's playing support man.
[23181.96s -> 23183.96s]  It makes your brain smaller.
[23183.96s -> 23201.14s]  Actually, like I swear,
[23201.14s -> 23203.14s]  playing support makes my brain smaller.
[23203.14s -> 23211.66s]  Other than dragon.
[23211.66s -> 23233.98s]  Desire is trolling.
[23233.98s -> 23235.98s]  I think.
[23235.98s -> 23238.93s]  Pretty sure I just freeze this.
[23238.93s -> 23239.93s]  No, with the locks?
[23239.93s -> 23245.57s]  Yeah, she's just trolling.
[23245.57s -> 23247.57s]  I don't know what the fuck that was.
[23247.57s -> 23254.52s]  I took a little bit of damage, but she has to over extend now.
[23254.52s -> 23276.29s]  Not bad.
[23276.29s -> 23283.09s]  Okay, so the Ziya wanted to back the reason that I froze that was because I want the back, but she can't back until we push the way
[23283.09s -> 23289.49s]  Then or until they push the way then, right? So it gives me time to kind of catch up on my back timer with the Ziya
[23290.29s -> 23292.29s]  Because I'm you know a little bit behind and farm
[23301.41s -> 23306.77s]  Thresh is definitely gonna go mid here. He's either gonna go mid or he's gonna try and hook us from the bush
[23308.61s -> 23312.93s]  I think I'm gonna shoot my W through all the bushes here. Okay, Thresh isn't in the bushes
[23314.13s -> 23323.51s]  He's just me a we don't know where he is. This is awkward because I can't really walk up. I mean, I guess I'm almost sick. So I guess I could walk up.
[23325.51s -> 23334.40s]  Yeah, there he is. Okay, we see him. He's a little five so it's.
[23334.40s -> 23358.21s]  We could probably actually fight like if this guy lands a binding, I might be able to just trade. I just I and I'm dead. I suck. Honestly, I need to do it my bad. I'm playing bad. That's on me.
[23358.21s -> 23364.21s]  I'm going to have a
[23364.21s -> 23366.21s]  $1.00
[23366.21s -> 23368.21s]  $1.00
[23368.21s -> 23372.93s]  $1.00
[23372.93s -> 23374.93s]  $1.00
[23374.93s -> 23376.93s]  $1.00
[23376.93s -> 23378.93s]  $1.00
[23378.93s -> 23382.93s]  $1.00
[23382.93s -> 23384.93s]  $1.00
[23384.93s -> 23388.31s]  $1.00
[23388.31s -> 23394.63s]  $1.00
[23394.63s -> 23397.63s]  and see if I can stop the Ziya's back, maybe.
[23397.63s -> 23399.63s]  I mean, she's backing and a weird spot.
[23399.63s -> 23403.13s]  Yeah, we stop their backs.
[23403.13s -> 23405.13s]  Huge. Okay, now they're in trouble.
[23405.13s -> 23410.13s]  So, they really need to the back on that timer,
[23410.13s -> 23413.13s]  because they just want to fight, right?
[23413.13s -> 23417.13s]  And because they just want to fight, they want to go back, right?
[23417.13s -> 23419.13s]  No way.
[23419.13s -> 23423.98s]  Dude, fuck off.
[23423.98s -> 23426.98s]  I cannot dodge a hook right now to save my fucking life.
[23426.98s -> 23443.85s]  Jesus Christ what is my movement man like tilting myself right now I want to stay for this wave
[23443.85s -> 23454.73s]  But mid is me. Yeah, I can't it feels so bad because I needed one more wave to get double pickaxe
[23455.57s -> 23459.53s]  So I can get my upgrade because like normally you go noon quiver pickaxe pickaxe
[23459.85s -> 23464.29s]  If you go noon pick pick it gives you enough AD to get your cue upgrade right?
[23464.29s -> 23468.43s]  And that's like the whole point you don't need crack-in using your Q upgrade because your Q upgrade is when you start bursting
[23469.33s -> 23474.19s]  But because I got hooked under the turrets even though we got a kill I had to back and I couldn't get my timer
[23474.59s -> 23486.06s]  I'm so trash
[23486.06s -> 23488.54s]  I need some coffee. That's sort of the asmen. I swear to god
[23489.52s -> 23491.52s]  Coffee's my savior. It'll save me
[23516.94s -> 23523.10s]  That wave actually just did that's my holy shit
[23524.36s -> 23527.36s]  We don't actually do anything here crazy
[23527.36s -> 23561.97s]  Nice, well played. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. That was good to be, too.
[23561.97s -> 23576.62s]  I got my Q upgrade, now we're chillin'. Oh, now we're havein' chillin'. Oh, yeah, baby.
[23576.62s -> 23594.64s]  You know what it is? It's like, uh, I'm playing the fights too quick. I just got to slow down and I think I'm like too hyped up.
[23594.64s -> 23611.75s]  I really don't want to miss this wave. There's a person right there. Oh shit, let's go.
[23611.75s -> 23616.75s]  I'm going to go farm bot. Well, that guy gets that.
[23616.75s -> 23622.49s]  This watch is really good.
[23622.49s -> 23634.68s]  I kind of want to, oh, I can't get this point, fuck.
[23634.68s -> 23639.24s]  What? What?
[23639.24s -> 23641.24s]  That was BS.
[23641.24s -> 23650.86s]  Okay, you know what, I'll just take my entire HP bar really quick on the turret, it's not a big deal, guys.
[23650.86s -> 23654.86s]  I'm just, I'm bad good at the game. I don't mean to brag, but like, you know,
[23654.86s -> 23656.86s]  Professional gamer over here, like you know
[23659.20s -> 23686.98s]  I'm gonna be able to want some blessings like I got you do it look up big my shield is wait
[23688.72s -> 23690.72s]  You son of a bitch
[23691.72s -> 23708.67s]  I mean she's dead, but I got out play and man
[23712.95s -> 23728.04s]  Mother fucker. All right, they forfeet a nice
[23728.04s -> 23756.27s]  I need to make some coffee, I'm playing back. Give me a sec. We're playing real bad. I need some coffee. Nice though. We hit 400 LP. Let's go.
[23756.27s -> 23776.59s]  So now we just need 150 more. We need 550. I think 550 is GM. I didn't do anything that game by the way. I did nothing.
[23776.59s -> 23782.59s]  I could play another AD carry. That was fun. I'm going to grab some coffee. I'll be right back.
[23782.59s -> 23785.73s]  Talks amongst yourselves boys. I believe in you
[23786.83s -> 23792.27s]  You can look at my 80 carry tier of us that we've been trying to figure out how to do enjoy. I'll be me
[23792.91s -> 23794.91s]  Grab some coffee
[23795.63s -> 23896.54s]  Fucking ass
[23896.54s -> 23902.08s]  All right, I'm back. Let's go. Oh, fuck
[23903.66s -> 23905.66s]  Sweet
[23906.06s -> 23914.75s]  We back boys we back
[23914.75s -> 23925.29s]  Hmm, time is it five. Ooh. Hey, bring a plate for like another hour and then I gotta get off and make some dinner
[23927.13s -> 23943.20s]  Do some other shit, you know, I'm saying where we're in. Oh, yeah, we're making the tier list. Yeah, I think various is really good a
[23944.64s -> 23946.64s]  I think versus good eight here because
[23948.00s -> 23949.28s]  In my opinion
[23949.28s -> 23956.44s]  Various is never really like a bad pick almost like sometimes he's bad, but I think he's just you can play him on hit or you can play him
[23956.72s -> 23957.72s]  authority.
[23957.72s -> 23961.08s]  Right, so he's got two builds that you can do based on the game and the team gomp.
[23961.08s -> 23963.96s]  Because Ulti is pretty much always useful.
[23963.96s -> 23968.44s]  Like just having a stun, like a route on a champion is always going to be useful.
[23968.44s -> 23971.20s]  Then you have, he's got very long range, like engage.
[23971.20s -> 23974.04s]  You can safely kill people with his help in his queue.
[23974.04s -> 23977.40s]  You can build him poke or like before objectives, you can make picks really easily.
[23977.40s -> 23980.32s]  You can poke people up before the objective, get him low.
[23980.32s -> 23983.64s]  His lane phase is really good if you understand how to play various.
[23983.64s -> 23991.08s]  in phase is exceptional. He also has in the meta, currently, I feel like he's just like a good pick.
[23991.08s -> 23995.32s]  I don't think he's as good as Draven and Jinks for SoulCube, but I do think he's really good.
[23996.44s -> 24003.96s]  In general, you can climb with him really easily. And then I put Ash here too. Maybe Ash,
[24003.96s -> 24011.16s]  I don't know who I'd put in front. Ash or Varus. I thought maybe Ash or Mirvius. I think Ash is
[24011.16s -> 24027.08s]  really underrated though. I think Ash is super super good right now. I think Ash is super good
[24028.04s -> 24035.32s]  because sorry I'm trying to think she's basically the same idea as Varus. She's a little different but
[24035.32s -> 24042.52s]  she's the same idea. She controls lane phase pretty well. Rally her lane isn't too bad. She also has
[24044.76s -> 24049.40s]  like her are always useful no matter what. So you always have use with Ash. You always have
[24049.40s -> 24055.26s]  use with various art like they just stuns, snares, etc. She's also really good at being
[24055.26s -> 24059.58s]  annoying in team fights, like you can take Ghost on Ash and you can just voice and outside
[24059.58s -> 24063.74s]  their range and if you just speak basically solo people and she actually has decent scaling
[24063.74s -> 24068.50s]  on her crit now. So you can go a bunch of builds too, like I think you can go Bork Ash,
[24068.50s -> 24073.12s]  you can go Crack and Slayer Ash into Bork or you can go Crack and Slayer into IE or you
[24073.12s -> 24073.86s]  can go Crack and Slayer into IE or you can go Crack and Slayer into IE or you can go Crack and Slayer
[24073.86s -> 24078.72s]  into IE or you can go Shield though Ash if they have tanks, you can go Galforce that, oh you
[24078.72s -> 24084.16s]  beings do a lot of different builds on Ash and I think she's really versatile. You can also just go the on head build if you really want. I
[24084.66s -> 24090.64s]  I think the rageblade build sucks personally. I think that if I was gonna go on hit I would just be like shield bow with and until I
[24091.08s -> 24093.68s]  Bork or some shit if I was actually gonna do that or shield bow
[24094.16s -> 24103.45s]  Bork or pork with or whatever, but yeah, I don't know as well as probably a tier two
[24104.89s -> 24107.21s]  I said as well as really gated by like skill
[24107.21s -> 24114.89s]  So I don't want to put him in. I think if you could play as real perfectly he'd be at the top of us like he would just be above jinx
[24115.29s -> 24120.41s]  Just best champion in the game if you could if you could never miss a skillshot like a hundred percent accuracy
[24120.41s -> 24125.45s]  play in perfect like the champs and saying rent it's absolutely crazy. Oh good that champ is if you could play in perfect
[24125.45s -> 24127.85s]  But here like people are humans, et cetera
[24128.17s -> 24132.65s]  So I think he's like an a tier pick and solo queue because you can get countered like he's not blindable
[24132.65s -> 24134.65s]  You can get countered pretty easily by good players
[24134.65s -> 24140.61s]  People play like push comps people play dive comps like early game. I mean in lane and shit
[24140.61s -> 24142.77s]  Like because Ezreal's lane is like not it's not bad
[24142.93s -> 24151.83s]  But it's very difficult to play Ezreal well and lane fate. You gotta be good mechanically and I don't think even like I've seen like challenge your players who can't play Ezreal
[24151.83s -> 24153.83s]  So he's not easy
[24155.45s -> 24197.22s]  You know what I'm saying? What's up boys? So I was gonna be a kindred, but I couldn't find her
[24197.22s -> 24204.86s]  I hate Kindred.
[24204.86s -> 24206.86s]  Yo, how are we doing tonight?
[24206.86s -> 24226.64s]  How's everybody's day?
[24226.64s -> 24247.40s]  Okay, so this guy is picking Thresh again.
[24247.40s -> 24260.42s]  Thresh is actually pretty good in the Rakan.
[24260.42s -> 24262.42s]  They have Ziya Thresh again.
[24262.42s -> 24281.82s]  It's quite jinx.
[24281.82s -> 24286.22s]  I like jinx here.
[24286.22s -> 24290.22s]  Even though it is against Thresh, jinx is a little scary, right?
[24290.22s -> 24292.22s]  But I kind of like her in this situation.
[24292.22s -> 24299.78s]  See what runs.
[24299.78s -> 24300.78s]  Do I want free boots?
[24300.78s -> 24304.78s]  No, I think I want, I want to be able to get early boots this him.
[24304.78s -> 24313.47s]  because their team comp is like oh yeah, their team comp is really really annoying so I kind of want to get
[24315.39s -> 24317.39s]  early boots
[24317.39s -> 24319.39s]  I'll probably go
[24319.39s -> 24321.39s]  present some minds
[24321.39s -> 24328.20s]  although I think over Hill isn't bad actually I'll go over Hill
[24329.62s -> 24333.48s]  So yeah, these these run so good actually let's do this
[24335.18s -> 24337.18s]  What is this?
[24337.18s -> 24347.47s]  this. Yeah, this is good. Okay. I kind of like these. This is good. I'm going to use these. Okay.
[24348.19s -> 24353.55s]  I'm taking claims this game because they have a Sondra and Pantheon and Thresh, right? So with
[24353.55s -> 24360.51s]  Sondra Pantheon and Thresh, the game's going to be like really fast of like okay, if they stun
[24360.51s -> 24365.15s]  me, I'm just going to get CC change and I'm just going to die like after a bit, right? It's going
[24365.15s -> 24371.86s]  to be like a stun and they're starting and they're starting and I'm just going to die. Some like
[24371.86s -> 24400.38s]  I'm not fuck that shit.
[24400.38s -> 24409.85s]  Let's see if we can get this double you boys.
[24409.85s -> 24411.85s]  Let's see if I can not fuck up the first three levels
[24411.85s -> 24416.37s]  to the win.
[24416.37s -> 24417.21s]  Got you, I restrict it?
[24417.21s -> 24418.85s]  Oh yeah.
[24418.85s -> 24423.60s]  It's for a while.
[24423.60s -> 24425.64s]  It's Riot's secret code to make it
[24425.64s -> 24448.11s]  so I could actually play the game and climb without chatting.
[24448.11s -> 24449.67s]  Okay.
[24449.67s -> 24451.27s]  I should have warded this bush.
[24453.87s -> 24456.11s]  I was drinking my coffee, I didn't think about it.
[24456.11s -> 24458.51s]  But yeah, if you guys are against the hook champ,
[24458.51s -> 24463.37s]  always ward this bush.
[24463.37s -> 24468.37s]  Right right here, you're gonna want to ward here early against the most hook champions
[24469.37s -> 24475.37s]  because it gives you a very nice, like they can't walk in here in cheesy, they can't walk in here in cheesy.
[24476.37s -> 24478.37s]  So you just don't get cheesed by anything.
[24505.90s -> 24511.94s]  I mean, that's just, I don't even know what I just saw.
[24512.94s -> 24515.94s]  I'll be real, I don't know what the fuck just happened, but okay.
[24516.94s -> 24518.94s]  Trying to push this way of as fast as I can.
[24519.94s -> 24521.94s]  Not sure I can actually get it pushed fast enough, but we're gonna try.
[24533.78s -> 24539.78s]  It was close.
[24539.78s -> 24541.50s]  No, I'm not what it just,
[24541.50s -> 24544.26s]  well, it's not a huge deal.
[24544.26s -> 24546.30s]  It was very close though.
[24546.30s -> 24547.62s]  We can just break the freeze, right?
[24547.62s -> 24552.48s]  It's not a huge deal.
[24552.48s -> 24554.44s]  Are they supposed to win the level one?
[24554.44s -> 24555.12s]  It depends.
[24555.12s -> 24557.76s]  I mean, Ziya's not that good level one.
[24557.76s -> 24561.32s]  Like, Ziya's good because she has her feathers, right?
[24561.32s -> 24563.00s]  But if you can't stack your feathers level one,
[24563.00s -> 24565.08s]  Jinx has more damage.
[24565.08s -> 24567.36s]  And they stacked up for my rocket.
[24567.36s -> 24570.04s]  So I got like, I've full stacked my lethal tempo
[24570.04s -> 24577.02s]  And I just double a we rocketed them over and over and over and over again right and so
[24577.74s -> 24580.62s]  When they finally all went they were just behind an HP
[24581.90s -> 24584.30s]  Also, Thresh missed he only had a fly
[24610.55s -> 24612.95s]  damn that was so close man
[24613.91s -> 24634.10s]  Like actually if the Ratchet died there or not Thresh it graves died there. We just win the game
[24648.65s -> 24650.97s]  Yeah, this isn't good. Oh, I'm gonna get flight. I'm dead
[24652.33s -> 24655.21s]  Maybe oh, maybe I'm not dead. I have to walk up like this
[24655.53s -> 24662.53s]  It was a really bad fight by the, what, what am I watching with the fuck?
[24662.53s -> 24668.05s]  That was the bad fight because, um, we knew Graves was bought and we knew that he was
[24668.05s -> 24670.61s]  going to kill in the jungle, right?
[24670.61s -> 24674.97s]  So my, my jungler already got outplayed by Graves once, top side.
[24674.97s -> 24677.61s]  You shouldn't ever take another fight like that, the bot side.
[24677.61s -> 24679.33s]  You should just take the win, right?
[24679.33s -> 24685.17s]  Like I rotated, now granted the Recon should have been there to help kill the Graves.
[24685.17s -> 24688.85s]  Like when I rotated, Rakan was still jacking off in Lian, right?
[24688.85s -> 24691.45s]  Like when I was here Rakan was like way down here.
[24691.45s -> 24695.05s]  So the support should have rotated first, right?
[24695.05s -> 24698.97s]  Like I rotated, but the support should have been the one rotating, but again, he's just...
[24698.97s -> 24702.41s]  A lot of the time you have support players who don't understand timers and I had to help
[24702.41s -> 24703.41s]  jump.
[24703.41s -> 24704.41s]  Nobody plays for jungle.
[24704.41s -> 24710.61s]  So support players hate playing for jungle in Laila, so it's just not a thing.
[24710.61s -> 24716.61s]  So I tried to go over and help him, but I misplaced my traps a little bit.
[24716.61s -> 24721.37s]  And then the graves had a flash, but he got away.
[24721.37s -> 24725.93s]  And they tried to go in again when I was too low to actually help.
[24725.93s -> 24726.93s]  We just got lucky.
[24726.93s -> 24732.39s]  We didn't lose the game off that shit.
[24732.39s -> 24733.39s]  Kind of does suck those.
[24733.39s -> 24749.59s]  I was really strong now.
[24749.59s -> 24750.59s]  Not bad.
[24750.59s -> 24754.71s]  I should have, oh, I should have killed her.
[24754.71s -> 24758.30s]  I suppose I could have killed the guy.
[24758.30s -> 24759.30s]  No joke.
[24759.30s -> 24764.30s]  them. If I had awarded the Lantern as you tried to take it, I would have killed the
[24764.30s -> 24780.96s]  Ziya. Because she egoed the Lantern there. She egoed the Lantern so hard. If I had
[24780.96s -> 24799.30s]  awarded it, she dies there. It's my bad. This game is really interesting because the enemy
[24799.30s -> 24804.18s]  ball lanes are actually misplaying a lot. Like they're really, really, really misplaying
[24804.18s -> 24811.86s]  these fights and trades and shit, but we can't abuse it because the graves have so much
[24811.86s -> 24816.66s]  control of the game right now that we have to basically play safe permanently at the moment
[24816.66s -> 24836.62s]  and I can't do anything to help my team. It feels really bad. Yeah, there we go.
[24836.62s -> 24854.50s]  See what graves have bought again, man. This is so rough. Graves is men. I want to kill this. It's
[24854.50s -> 24872.70s]  fast as I can. We can fight these guys too, actually. Wait, why didn't you just go in?
[24882.08s -> 24886.40s]  I don't know why he didn't just double you immediately. Like they were concentrated. All that
[24886.40s -> 24891.84s]  tells me. Like when she was against the wall here, he should have immediately doubled her.
[24894.32s -> 24900.64s]  Because if he w's from vision there, right? And she's against the wall, it helps us so much.
[24900.64s -> 24908.64s]  Because then I can overlay my flame chomps on top of the uh, I can overlay my flame chomps directly on top of the Ziya
[24908.64s -> 24916.04s]  Right as the fights happening rather than like having to work around the fight because the rushes in my face type shit, you know
[24920.38s -> 24923.38s]  So we're just we're honestly just losing because we're not pulling the trigger fast enough
[24925.38s -> 24928.38s]  And we can't play aggressive when we can pull the trigger
[24930.82s -> 24935.22s]  Right like we're losing because we can't pull the trigger fast enough and when we can pull the trigger it's the wrong time
[24935.82s -> 24953.31s]  We do this right now. We get dragon. The bowling back to get dragon here. I want to go. Uh, I actually want to go.
[24953.31s -> 24964.82s]  Wait, the enemy bot lane didn't back. Okay, they're trolling. They lost an objective for free here. This is really good.
[24964.82s -> 24968.82s]  So the enemy bot lane, we fight this by the way. We just, we can just straight up fight.
[24968.82s -> 24987.00s]  That right there is how you lancer, how you lured a lancer by the way. Oh, I did that guy so dirty.
[24987.00s -> 24993.00s]  Oh, I'm bad.
[24993.00s -> 24993.68s]  Bye guys.
[25001.17s -> 25003.29s]  I didn't know Pantheon was me, that was my bad.
[25004.65s -> 25007.17s]  I was like, I was too happy with warning the lantern.
[25009.80s -> 25010.72s]  Bye, bad.
[25010.72s -> 25018.60s]  I can't believe the enemy team greeted that hard though for gold.
[25023.09s -> 25024.13s]  Well, that's actually nuts to me.
[25031.94s -> 25034.78s]  No, yeah, the Ziya's egoing, like crazy.
[25036.46s -> 25041.62s]  The problem is I can't abuse it constantly because, like, obviously, like, I need teammates, right?
[25041.62s -> 25090.85s]  I can kind of abuse it, like, but it's much harder by yourself, because as you can see, like, I'm not playing poorly, but we're getting like, we're getting shit on, shit on's a bad word, we're getting like, oh, come on man, they misplayed that so badly, but we're con just ate the fucking, whatever, I'm not gonna blame the con, it's fun.
[25090.85s -> 25095.85s]  I'm so sad about that though, they misplayed that so incredibly badly.
[25095.85s -> 25097.85s]  Like so badly.
[25097.85s -> 25101.85s]  It was just that like Rekhan all ended the thrash with his ultimate.
[25101.85s -> 25107.85s]  But all he had to do there was use his E to come back to me and then play front to back afterward.
[25107.85s -> 25110.85s]  But he's he set their auto wing the thrash.
[25110.85s -> 25115.85s]  But you don't need the auto M, you just need to engage and then I can maybe play on after it.
[25115.85s -> 25122.27s]  I probably could have double killed them there too.
[25122.27s -> 25130.34s]  kind of messed up. My team wants out. It's not, it's, it's silly because the game's
[25130.34s -> 25139.91s]  not even over. Like we actually can win this game so incredibly easily. So easily, if
[25139.91s -> 25144.51s]  we just play it correctly, because their ball lane is really fucking bad. I didn't want
[25144.51s -> 25157.66s]  to be mean, but I'll just be mean, their ball lane is really fucking bad. Well, I'm dead.
[25157.66s -> 25166.66s]  still bad. I'm just egoing. That was my ego. I still spend by it. I still think they're
[25166.66s -> 25173.02s]  bad. This is 0.1 B3 mid. The threat has not been mid one time. So it must be the top
[25173.02s -> 25187.04s]  winner. I'm so frustrated right now with this game. Because I feel like we should have
[25187.04s -> 25193.00s]  won so many all-ends that we didn't win. Barely, like barely didn't win some all-ends.
[25193.00s -> 25195.00s]  I thought we should have won all of them.
[25196.64s -> 25199.32s]  Like they they didn't land like a good all-in once.
[25199.32s -> 25201.32s]  Thresh didn't land a single hook once.
[25202.44s -> 25204.44s]  And this is my recon. Like he just tried to...
[25204.92s -> 25207.40s]  He just used his R to try and engage.
[25208.12s -> 25215.34s]  I think Nocturn is done mentally.
[25219.27s -> 25221.27s]  Okay, so in games like this,
[25223.13s -> 25225.13s]  like this Thresh is so bad.
[25225.13s -> 25249.75s]  Oh, let's go, baby.
[25250.63s -> 25251.83s]  Huge!
[25255.46s -> 25257.46s]  That was so huge. Let's fucking go.
[25257.46s -> 25280.12s]  like I I'm gonna hit no at 15 because dude I really don't want to lose to the
[25280.12s -> 25286.20s]  Strashing desire like this trash is doing the most the most ego shit I've ever
[25286.20s -> 25291.04s]  seen and he's just getting away with shit like right there the trash walks up
[25291.04s -> 25297.64s]  with every spell and expects to get away with that shit nah nah nah we win these
[25297.64s -> 25303.00s]  we win these trust give me let me cook let me cook I see my team do let me cook
[25303.00s -> 25309.00s]  a bit, you know. We had a bad early game. Had to play weak side. Let me cook. Let me cook.
[25310.76s -> 25375.18s]  We are chilling. If I landed that, that would have been sick. The rest is top two. We can kill this guy.
[25383.54s -> 25387.94s]  Come on guys, don't forfeit. Guys, the game is winnable. Oh my god.
[25389.14s -> 25397.50s]  Dude, the game is how is the raccoon gonna forfeit? Dude, that game is so winnable and hurts.
[25397.50s -> 25416.12s]  like dude really that actually is so infuriating that's so infuriating man that game
[25416.12s -> 25423.59s]  was so incredibly winnable like look at this I did more damage than every single player
[25423.59s -> 25432.07s]  on the enemy team if my team just relaxed we win the game a thousand times over that
[25432.07s -> 25438.95s]  game. Like the game is over. We have a racon, a rumble, and a woocon for me to sit
[25438.95s -> 25444.39s]  in, sit behind. And we saw how bad their bot lane was, right? I have plans for the
[25444.39s -> 25450.05s]  only way they can kill me. I have a man. I wish to God. I'm a report of them all.
[25450.05s -> 25454.41s]  Like these fuckers, I guarantee I get a notification. There's no way these people
[25454.41s -> 25460.78s]  are not toxic. There's no way you, this, like you just want out of a game after
[25460.78s -> 25463.78s]  of fucking your team is just doing well.
[25465.28s -> 25468.48s]  No, man, the score is 10 to 14.
[25469.38s -> 25471.78s]  10 to 14.
[25473.94s -> 25476.14s]  You have a Fed 80 carry.
[25481.38s -> 25481.98s]  Look at this.
[25482.18s -> 25483.28s]  Dude, we forfeited.
[25483.28s -> 25485.68s]  We were down 2.5K.
[25488.46s -> 25491.26s]  We had a better scaling comp than them.
[25491.56s -> 25492.86s]  Like we outscale them.
[25494.86s -> 25496.46s]  We have two dragons.
[25496.56s -> 25497.86s]  We outscale them.
[25497.86s -> 25501.86s]  And we're down 2.5K.
[25501.86s -> 25505.86s]  And my team rage hits forfeit.
[25505.86s -> 25509.86s]  Oh my god, that's so gross.
[25509.86s -> 25518.02s]  That is so disgusting.
[25518.02s -> 25519.02s]  So disgusting.
[25519.02s -> 25527.78s]  Why am I in a game with this player?
[25527.78s -> 25532.78s]  I'm 412 LP masters.
[25532.78s -> 25541.74s]  I was in a game just now with a 7 LP Masters jungler, and he's not on a smurf.
[25541.74s -> 25549.61s]  This is not a smurf account, because last season this guy was D4.
[25549.61s -> 25551.53s]  So he's not on a smurf.
[25551.53s -> 25556.52s]  Why is this player in my game?
[25556.52s -> 25561.08s]  Why is this player in a 400 LP Master game?
[25561.08s -> 25562.08s]  Why?
[25562.08s -> 25569.85s]  Or rather why am I in a Diamond 1 game?
[25569.85s -> 25573.21s]  You can go to his previous games, he doesn't even have good MMR.
[25573.21s -> 25579.21s]  Well, if you look at these games, they're all like 100 to 100 LP, right? Why am I in this game?
[25579.21s -> 25585.65s]  Why did you put me in a game with this player? Like this guy? I don't really care if he sucks.
[25585.65s -> 25591.65s]  I'm more frustrated the fact that these players mental boom at the first sign of any negativity. Look at this.
[25592.65s -> 25595.65s]  They just give up. First sign of anything negative. They go next.
[25597.65s -> 25600.65s]  Like I actually could have won B9 to this game too, like actually,
[25600.65s -> 25607.65s]  But I'm not allowed to try in 1v9 because my team once out of the game had fucking 4 minutes or 15 minutes.
[25607.65s -> 25610.65s]  That sucks, man.
[25610.65s -> 25612.65s]  The new system is trash.
[25612.65s -> 25617.65s]  I'm sorry, but the the 415 system is good sometimes.
[25617.65s -> 25623.65s]  They should have a requirement that you have to be losing by X amount of gold for it to kick in.
[25623.65s -> 25625.65s]  That should that should be it.
[25625.65s -> 25630.75s]  They should have a requirement. You have to be losing by 5k plus for it to work at 15
[25631.31s -> 25635.96s]  Like there needs to be something
[25636.42s -> 25640.56s]  Where there's a requirement because people are so stupid
[25641.22s -> 25647.82s]  Right like that game was 100% ours. We had two dragons were down 2000 gold at 16 minutes and
[25648.66s -> 25658.30s]  Woocon's 3 and 1. We've done four kills. Woocon's 3 and 1. I'm I'm literally
[25659.14s -> 25661.14s]  Insanely strong
[25661.14s -> 25666.34s]  Even though we got weeks ahead, I'm still winning. We just two V2 them bots out of the map right away. We just want a two V2
[25668.38s -> 25672.50s]  Rumble's just like, like, ah, sorry. I'm just mad. I'm mad.
[25673.50s -> 25681.66s]  Like they need to require they need to require something other than four people like require four people and a gold lead or something like that's so cancer
[25684.62s -> 25691.54s]  That's so fucking frustrating man. Like I can't believe how bad people's mental's are
[25691.54s -> 25697.30s]  Like the, okay, I get it. The, the, the rumble and the, the rumble and the, the, the rumble and the
[25697.30s -> 25701.22s]  nocturn, I understand wanting to forfeit. Okay. Okay. Okay. They're having a bad game.
[25701.22s -> 25705.46s]  They want out the raging. They need to get their frustration. I get it. But why are we forfeiting
[25709.28s -> 25716.72s]  when, Wukong is 3 and 1? I have 7 of our KP. I'm the 80 carry. I'm very, I just got my mythic.
[25717.60s -> 25722.32s]  We have two dragons. And we're cons forfeiting to, I don't know, man.
[25724.32s -> 25734.00s]  Ah, that's just frustrating, it's all like, I'm be real.
[25734.00s -> 25739.36s]  I carry this game every day of the week, every day of the week, I carry those.
[25739.36s -> 25770.39s]  So, apparently Riot is doing something about smurfing, though, and I can't wait until
[25770.39s -> 25772.59s]  they do.
[25772.59s -> 25776.43s]  This is actually a really good thing that I wanted to talk about earlier in the stream,
[25776.43s -> 25777.43s]  but I forgot.
[25777.43s -> 25782.19s]  Apparently Riot is doing something to make smurfing harder, because apparently smurfing is
[25782.19s -> 25784.15s]  outrageous right now.
[25784.15s -> 25788.15s]  I kind of think that they need to stop this too.
[25788.15s -> 25792.15s]  So there's a thing you can do in solo queue right now,
[25792.15s -> 25795.15s]  where you can make a new account,
[25795.15s -> 25801.15s]  and you can do it with somebody on different accounts on a new account,
[25801.15s -> 25806.15s]  and your MMOR doesn't actually get like lowered.
[25806.15s -> 25813.23s]  So if you win a game, let's say you win a game,
[25813.23s -> 25825.60s]  I think this is just him leveling me account, but let's say, let's say you went a game and in that game, you do all with somebody in a lower MMR, right?
[25825.60s -> 25838.60s]  Now when you do all in a lower MMR, I don't know if this guy did this or not, but when you do a somebody in a lower MMR, your MMR is based on now the game thinks that you're in that MMR and you can do it in placements.
[25838.60s -> 25843.90s]  So, in your very first games, for some reason, there's no MMR lock on placements.
[25843.90s -> 25850.66s]  So you can in your placements, do all with somebody who's like bronze, right?
[25850.66s -> 25852.40s]  And you can play with them.
[25852.40s -> 25857.44s]  And then the game thinks you're still winning, so it keeps amplifying your MMR.
[25857.44s -> 25861.36s]  So when I'm describing this really poorly, but essentially you can do all in lower e-lose
[25861.36s -> 25866.04s]  and the game doesn't know your MMR belongs in that e-lose, because you're winning
[25866.04s -> 25870.36s]  in that yellow, the game can't figure that out for some reason, the algorithm.
[25870.36s -> 25876.28s]  So when they stop du-occuing, it's still inflated them, it's still inflated their
[25876.28s -> 25879.36s]  MMR to where it would be if they had solo queueed.
[25879.36s -> 25880.36s]  Does that make sense?
[25880.36s -> 25881.92s]  And what I'm saying?
[25881.92s -> 25886.24s]  So it basically says that they went like 10 and no in their placements, right?
[25886.24s -> 25891.56s]  So now they're in like a master tier MMR from a brand new account.
[25891.56s -> 25896.00s]  So now those people are in like D1 masters MMR, but they played, they, they, one
[25896.00s -> 25909.91s]  in gold. I also don't think you smurfing should be so easily accessible. Like this
[25909.91s -> 25914.47s]  guy's not a bad player per se, but I don't think he's a master to a player, right?
[25914.47s -> 25919.27s]  Like this guy's a rumble player on a new account. From that game alone, the fact he gave
[25919.27s -> 25942.77s]  up tells me he's not a good player. Dude, I'm, I'm a head the advocate or for like,
[25943.65s -> 25947.49s]  right at, you have to attach like a verification to your accounts.
[25947.49s -> 25953.33s]  I know Riot would never do that, but I'm like a heavy advocate for like having to attach
[25953.33s -> 25957.25s]  verification to play ranked.
[25957.25s -> 25961.68s]  I think it'd be great, honestly.
[25961.68s -> 25976.91s]  I think it would help so much if you're very, very account-vander you done for it.
[25976.91s -> 25981.15s]  Yeah, you have to get like a VPN to play other than like you would have to.
[25981.15s -> 25982.55s]  That's my point though.
[25982.55s -> 25987.79s]  Like if you get your very fight account banned, right?
[25987.79s -> 25989.95s]  Like okay, that counts done.
[25989.95s -> 26013.52s]  Like I said, I don't think Riot would ever do it because it's too extreme and I don't think Riot has the balls to ever do that shit
[26014.08s -> 26018.48s]  VPN's only five dollars. Yeah, but dude, are you gonna tell me that you're gonna buy
[26019.52s -> 26024.56s]  People who get banned on accounts typically get banned consistently. That's why they're making smurfs
[26025.84s -> 26026.88s]  Right
[26026.88s -> 26032.80s]  So you're telling me somebody's gonna be willing to pay five dollars for a new phone number verification or whatever
[26032.80s -> 26048.00s]  every time they have to make a new account, they're not, not you me.
[26048.00s -> 26054.00s]  Lulu, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Don't I have swirfs? Yeah, I do.
[26054.00s -> 26059.00s]  And I stand by all my swirfs should be attached to the same like account.
[26059.00s -> 26064.00s]  Well, if you make a smurf, okay, this is what I think should happen.
[26064.00s -> 26067.00s]  You should be able to put all of your swirfs on one account.
[26067.00s -> 26070.60s]  account. So you, you can make Smurfs and you can add that
[26070.60s -> 26074.44s]  smurf verification to an account. But it kind of like
[26074.44s -> 26077.32s]  battle.net. Does that make sense? You know, like battle
[26077.32s -> 26080.28s]  that has all your accounts in the battle.net thing, but you can
[26080.28s -> 26083.72s]  sign in to battle.net. I think that the way to make it make
[26083.72s -> 26087.80s]  a viable would be like you could put all, if you didn't have a
[26087.80s -> 26091.08s]  second phone number, didn't want one, you could put Smurfs up to
[26091.08s -> 26093.40s]  like a limit. So you could have like three Smurfs or like two
[26093.40s -> 26095.96s]  Smurfs in your main account, right? So you could have like three
[26095.96s -> 26100.56s]  total accounts and you would have to like you could add those to the same like
[26100.56s -> 26105.52s]  Omega account right and that Omega account could be your verified account. Now
[26105.52s -> 26109.68s]  if any of your accounts get punished on your Omega account all of your
[26109.68s -> 26116.94s]  accounts get punished. So if any of your accounts get punished all of them
[26116.94s -> 26133.20s]  get punished. But I feel like that'd be a good play. Maybe I'm wrong but I feel like
[26133.20s -> 26141.69s]  it would work. Yo, it's a brush. I call you brush, it's a brush. Oh, what do I
[26141.69s -> 26154.60s]  I don't know what I want to do here, it's a strange okay. I wish I didn't have cleanse, cleanse is so worthless this game, like actually
[26156.38s -> 26163.82s]  Plans does nothing this game at all. I've just down a sum like maybe if the brand like tries to flash done me or some shit
[26164.18s -> 26179.44s]  But I'm just like down a sum of no. All right, boys
[26180.36s -> 26186.41s]  We got night blue three on our team. There's a throwback
[26247.95s -> 26258.32s]  Damn. Oh, we got him. I'm not gonna lie. I kind of looked like I was scripting.
[26260.32s -> 26264.08s]  That that movement, like if I was watching the game, I'd be like, what the fuck was that?
[26266.16s -> 26273.76s]  Like my movement was real sauce on that, like that all in right there. That's some, that's some sauce movement.
[26305.69s -> 26308.65s]  We can gank these guys. They have no, oh, there's gonna be a ward in here.
[26308.65s -> 26319.52s]  and
[26319.52s -> 26322.00s]  these people have no flashes
[26322.00s -> 26326.80s]  and we bought land has no flash this should be a free kill honestly
[26326.80s -> 26335.28s]  we just let this guy put you in they can't walk up and we just play for that
[26335.28s -> 26346.39s]  even if they try and three be three we should just win the three be three because we're stronger
[26346.39s -> 26358.34s]  this guy is just dead yet
[26358.34s -> 26363.48s]  i need level three
[26363.48s -> 26366.74s]  i kind of fucked my entire way of here
[26366.74s -> 26391.18s]  We push is there anywhere we can just push this oh nice nice well plan
[26392.66s -> 26406.00s]  Last job my blue glue is fucking fetish shit. Oh, I should have gone free boots this game
[26407.00s -> 26409.00s]  I didn't think about it
[26409.84s -> 26412.60s]  Because I don't need
[26412.60s -> 26417.04s]  Sork this game, you know how like the last game I told you I was going boots. I went boots for the
[26417.04s -> 26422.56s]  You know the fast boot to rush for thresh. I don't need that this game because
[26423.52s -> 26432.88s]  We just went through like faster method. So I should have gone three boots for like more efficiency
[26439.96s -> 26443.64s]  Okay, I'm just stand knock it just kill the man
[26444.64s -> 26470.19s]  You can't understand now. Just kill man. I want to push this way
[26470.99s -> 26472.99s]  So we don't get like shit on
[26472.99s -> 26506.65s]  I'm just killing man and you can't understand just kill man
[26506.65s -> 26515.69s]  kill man there is something can't understand
[26515.69s -> 26549.09s]  kill man I could go back here but I don't see any reason to go back yet
[26549.09s -> 26565.08s]  I think I'm dead.
[26565.08s -> 26569.08s]  I misplied that that was actually really good by the way cool down.
[26569.08s -> 26574.08s]  I wish I could tell him that he played it fine, I messed up, not him, I messed up.
[26574.08s -> 26584.39s]  I feel bad, I want to say no you're fine, because that was my bad.
[26584.39s -> 26588.39s]  I should have, okay, so when I flashed and I was running away from the twitch, right?
[26588.39s -> 26592.39s]  The second that twitch flashed on me, I should have instantly started autoing him.
[26592.39s -> 26598.39s]  It was one extra auto, like one single extra auto, and it would have been fine.
[26598.39s -> 26603.18s]  Why can't I tell her?
[26603.18s -> 26620.63s]  you know I just choose not to type anymore to my choice you know yeah my choice
[26620.63s -> 26646.41s]  all right guys actually doing that huh we went to be too really fucking hard
[26646.41s -> 26666.70s]  especially with tier two boots but I need to do I'm doing some scripty shit
[26666.70s -> 26678.50s]  I don't know you real dude we wasn't six I thought she was six I'm so bad
[26678.50s -> 26689.96s]  I wish I could tell her my bad again. I'm actually trolling like I ran out of mana because I'm bad, and then I
[26693.26s -> 26698.22s]  And then I thought she was six so I walked up to like take tank the turret for a second, right?
[26698.22s -> 26703.46s]  Because I was like, oh shit, maybe I'll get like we moving close guy. Maybe Louis has a spell or something. I just oh
[26703.46s -> 26710.48s]  I played bad my bad
[26710.48s -> 26721.39s]  W then make sure Akra is not there. I feel I actually just feel so bad because the movie is actually playing real
[26721.39s -> 26723.39s]  But there's like the best support of how it all day.
[26723.39s -> 26725.39s]  Like this guy's actually impressing me, right?
[26725.39s -> 26727.39s]  Like this guy's playing really well.
[26727.39s -> 26733.90s]  And I'm just griefing.
[26733.90s -> 26762.24s]  Move away for life for me.
[26762.24s -> 26767.28s]  Move away for life for me, boys.
[26767.28s -> 26772.98s]  Can we get a salute for Lulu and chat boys?
[26772.98s -> 26774.98s]  Can we get a salute?
[26774.98s -> 26778.80s]  Can we get some blood for Lulu?
[26778.80s -> 26788.98s]  She gave her life for the homey.
[26788.98s -> 26807.41s]  Honestly, that was a really cool to be too, by the way.
[26807.41s -> 26829.31s]  Oh, nice blue smurfing at what the fuck you killed that bitch too.
[26829.31s -> 26840.05s]  Nice.
[26840.05s -> 26842.05s]  No.
[26842.05s -> 26843.05s]  Oh.
[26843.05s -> 26847.05s]  But lost that cannon, I would have lost my life in game.
[26847.05s -> 26878.75s]  I'm gonna go BT second item.
[26878.75s -> 26879.75s]  We have blue blue.
[26879.75s -> 26882.75s]  So wait, what the fuck is this pathing?
[26882.75s -> 26885.75s]  I clicked to go bot and it passed me in the weirdest spot ever.
[26885.75s -> 26886.75s]  We have blue blue.
[26886.75s -> 26887.75s]  So I could actually go I.
[26887.75s -> 26891.75s]  But I think if I go BT, I'll be actually unkillable.
[26892.75s -> 26894.75s]  Like, it'll be the greatest thing ever.
[26897.06s -> 26902.06s]  I actually still might go IE as I'm thinking about it out loud by saying we have Louis Vu and not be stupid, but hey.
[26903.06s -> 26906.06s]  I guess still might, you know, I still might go IE, but I don't know yet.
[26907.06s -> 26913.02s]  Because I took a lacquerity, so it's like, wow.
[26925.57s -> 26948.62s]  No, what is that?
[26949.62s -> 26951.62s]  I mean, I don't know why I flashed away.
[26951.62s -> 26955.08s]  I'm playing bad.
[26955.08s -> 26957.42s]  That's my fault.
[26957.42s -> 26960.06s]  I think the game's over, so I'm just, I'm playing bad.
[26960.06s -> 26972.51s]  I'm like, let me test thing a little bit too much.
[26972.51s -> 26993.36s]  Eat today.
[26993.36s -> 27025.09s]  Nightmare.
[27025.09s -> 27026.09s]  Nightmare.
[27026.09s -> 27029.46s]  Nightmare.
[27029.46s -> 27041.31s]  Nightmare.
[27041.31s -> 27042.31s]  Nightmare.
[27042.31s -> 27043.31s]  Nightmare.
[27043.31s -> 27044.31s]  Nightmare.
[27044.31s -> 27045.31s]  Nightmare.
[27045.31s -> 27056.39s]  Nightmare.
[27056.39s -> 27057.39s]  Nightmare.
[27057.39s -> 27058.39s]  Nightmare.
[27058.39s -> 27059.39s]  Nightmare.
[27059.39s -> 27060.39s]  Nightmare.
[27060.39s -> 27061.39s]  Nightmare.
[27061.39s -> 27069.97s]  more mad you guys have no idea. So it's 24 to eight the enemy team doesn't
[27069.97s -> 27076.23s]  forfeit but my team forfeets when the score is 10 to 14 and we're only
[27076.23s -> 27102.04s]  down a thousand goals. Sorry I was that was my bad I was tilted by you know
[27102.04s -> 27107.64s]  I was thinking about how they weren't forfeeting and I was getting mad. It is a
[27107.64s -> 27111.00s]  little interesting because I said they still can't win. So I don't know who the
[27111.00s -> 27114.28s]  fuck's heading know, but it's probably Echo. Well, no Echo's definitely heading
[27114.28s -> 27127.82s]  know, but like, who else? Maybe Brandt? Maybe Ribbon. Maybe Ribbon's like yeah, they
[27127.82s -> 27137.68s]  just get a thousand gold. All right, I should probably stop throwing. I feel pretty
[27137.68s -> 27141.24s]  silly if we lost because I'm bad. After we've like dumpstered him and laying
[27141.24s -> 27162.18s]  that hard, I feel pretty silly if we lost because I keep getting caught. All right, I
[27162.18s -> 27168.88s]  I should be unkellable now, like I'm not even farming, I'm actually graphing.
[27168.88s -> 27170.88s]  I should probably go make dinner after this game.
[27170.88s -> 27175.12s]  I want to keep playing because I'm playing well today, but like, dude, my brain is starting
[27175.12s -> 27178.12s]  to go like, I probably need to go make some food.
[27178.12s -> 27181.12s]  I'm getting the full ADHD brain experience going.
[27181.12s -> 27202.59s]  So let's see if I can muster all my focus, let's see if I can muster up all my focus really
[27202.59s -> 27205.79s]  quick, just for push out and finish this game.
[27205.79s -> 27213.17s]  We'll go terminate our mode for the end of this game right now.
[27213.17s -> 27224.19s]  muster up all of the, uh, all of the focus.
[27224.19s -> 27225.95s]  Demon modengaged voice.
[27225.95s -> 27277.63s]  God, that sounded really cringe.
[27277.63s -> 27278.83s]  I'm actually really impressed though.
[27278.83s -> 27282.74s]  And I played this game really, really, really well.
[27282.74s -> 27284.34s]  Like, I'll be honest.
[27284.34s -> 27286.98s]  My last, like, thought of Night Blue was him
[27286.98s -> 27289.54s]  being bad at League.
[27289.54s -> 27295.17s]  He played this game really well.
[27295.17s -> 27303.14s]  My man's gotten so much better.
[27303.14s -> 27304.74s]  Okay, nobody saw that.
[27304.74s -> 27306.02s]  Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that.
[27306.02s -> 27306.90s]  Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that.
[27306.90s -> 27308.02s]  Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that.
[27308.02s -> 27308.90s]  Nobody saw that.
[27308.90s -> 27313.66s]  Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Not one of you saw me flash after the echo. I didn't want to be
[27321.54s -> 27326.70s]  Wasted flash. No, that was assertive flash. A assertive dominant flash
[27327.82s -> 27338.78s]  Not wasted at all. They might actually go for baron here. We should look for this
[27340.62s -> 27351.10s]  Oh, they could try. Oh, he's here. Pretty sure the ribbons here too, though
[27352.70s -> 27355.46s]  Yep, I did not mean to do that. I
[27355.46s -> 27359.46s]  I didn't mean to hit the thing. I accidentally hit the blast plants.
[27359.46s -> 27363.46s]  That was that was an accident. It was a literal pure accident.
[27363.46s -> 27371.47s]  Like I I did not mean to hit it. I was like I know ribbons here.
[27371.47s -> 27373.47s]  I'm going to wait for Yasuo before I go over.
[27373.47s -> 27375.47s]  Or before I do this right and I'm going to bat him.
[27375.47s -> 27379.47s]  And I just completely whiffed every like I'm bad.
[27379.47s -> 27381.47s]  We'll leave it at on bad. That's a good way to put on bad.
[27381.47s -> 27385.47s]  I'm hungry. I'm old. I'm bald. I'm bad. Nothing else to say.
[27385.47s -> 27388.71s]  to say short to short mad.
[27402.77s -> 27405.61s]  Yeah, that was a pedestrian flash.
[27406.81s -> 27407.69s]  It is too as well.
[27407.69s -> 27416.74s]  Oh yeah, it's a plothra, a plothra of terrible things.
[27416.74s -> 27418.26s]  I still gotta go to the gym tonight too.
[27443.03s -> 27445.23s]  It's dead, but okay.
[27446.23s -> 27449.79s]  I'm a little nervous about getting flanked, right?
[27449.79s -> 27469.22s]  Their junglers could just like sit in places.
[27469.22s -> 27470.90s]  Nice. We got top in him, not bad.
[27470.90s -> 27474.90s]  I mean, we just try and get mid and hit her.
[27474.90s -> 27498.16s]  Oh, let's go help our home either.
[27498.16s -> 27502.16s]  I'm actually so sad. I'm playing so bad.
[27502.16s -> 27505.16s]  Like I was playing so good at the start and now I'm playing so bad.
[27505.16s -> 27507.16s]  It actually makes me sad.
[27507.16s -> 27517.83s]  I was tanking for that guy.
[27517.83s -> 27530.62s]  All right, let's just leave.
[27530.62s -> 27542.33s]  I don't want to throw the game for my teammates.
[27542.33s -> 27545.33s]  Because like, I'm getting like, you know,
[27545.33s -> 27583.00s]  I've already died five times like a dip shit. Oh, where do you go? We should just push bot honestly
[27584.66s -> 27596.10s]  We don't even need a dragon
[27596.10s -> 27662.24s]  Okay, we should I'm just gonna push bot not bad not bad at all. I got to give it I want to give it the night blue
[27662.24s -> 27664.24s]  But I gotta give it to the sluroo
[27664.24s -> 27677.52s]  We would play that game so good. I got to give it to Lily. She played so fucking good like actually
[27677.52s -> 27693.63s]  I don't even know if she's still in here.
[27693.63s -> 27714.46s]  I'm not a script there.
[27714.46s -> 27732.63s]  She thinks I'm a, no, I'm serious.
[27732.63s -> 27734.63s]  She thinks I'm a script there.
[27734.63s -> 27740.76s]  Bro, I'm streaming.
[27740.76s -> 27761.26s]  I did the homie thought I'm a script there.
[27761.26s -> 27764.70s]  You know, I'll take it.
[27764.70s -> 27766.70s]  My ego feels good.
[27766.70s -> 27777.25s]  Honestly, that feels good.
[27777.25s -> 27778.25s]  That feels good.
[27778.25s -> 27784.06s]  Hi, little.
[27784.06s -> 27785.06s]  That was a script there.
[27785.06s -> 27786.06s]  Dude, I'm not gonna lie though.
[27786.06s -> 27788.06s]  Some of those movements were sus as fuck
[27788.06s -> 27793.42s]  as fuck that I was making like I was I like I like turned on the fucking mental
[27793.42s -> 27800.42s]  scripts for that game some of those movements early were nuts like like
[27800.42s -> 27804.50s]  just like this tiny little tiny little movements I was doing early game and
[27804.50s -> 27809.30s]  lame were crazy like look at this watch this like this movement right here
[27809.30s -> 27820.39s]  right like look I dodge that right then I walk up cleanse the thing
[27820.39s -> 27829.80s]  Kydown like that that movement is gross man look
[27832.18s -> 27836.54s]  That was actually some gross ass movement. I'm not gonna lie. Look at this
[27837.90s -> 27841.10s]  In the corner man in the corner
[27843.18s -> 27848.86s]  My brain was like
[27848.86s -> 27855.18s]  You know and drama. Thank you man. Yo, you played really good now. I felt bad. I felt so bad because I was griefing
[27855.18s -> 27861.70s]  Like I was like at the start of the game, we were just snowed like I literally fucked up like three times
[27862.54s -> 27865.10s]  During like the really important fights and I was like, oh no
[27865.70s -> 27873.66s]  Yeah, like the bits. Can I play close though? I can
[27874.22s -> 27881.95s]  I'm trying to figure out if I want to play a close-the game or if I want to go make dinner
[27888.79s -> 27894.17s]  There was one other movement that I thought was kind of nuts. I did a really good movement to somewhere
[27894.17s -> 27895.67s]  I don't remember what it was
[27895.67s -> 27899.70s]  Here's where I fucked up
[27899.70s -> 27906.18s]  So right now I should have just been I for some reason my brain lagged and I should have just been sitting here
[27907.54s -> 27910.34s]  I should have just cleansed and then started fighting the twitch
[27911.10s -> 27916.50s]  For some reason I didn't cleanse, but this wasn't like your fault at all like I the second the twitch flashed
[27916.50s -> 27919.94s]  I should have insta cleansed the ignite and I should have just been killing him
[27920.42s -> 27925.32s]  Like right now just like autoing because I can't get away from him right but it took me an extra second see I
[27925.32s -> 27935.51s]  I started fighting him now like I barely died. I wouldn't have died had I cleansed and had I just turned on initially
[27935.51s -> 27946.02s]  It was fine and then I hear I fucked up too because I went in and I thought we were six
[27954.30s -> 27956.30s]  Oh, I could have killed that guy
[27956.94s -> 27960.74s]  I should have gone forward one more. Oh, you know what I should have done there?
[27960.74s -> 27963.50s]  I should have gone forward one more auto killed this guy
[27963.50s -> 27968.14s]  Lulu would have gotten six off of the kill. I would have used my speed to come back out
[27968.14s -> 27974.56s]  Then she could have altered me. We could have killed the we could have got the twitch and then we could have turned on this echo too. Oh
[27981.90s -> 27984.38s]  This was a really cool to be to I
[27985.52s -> 27987.52s]  Actually thought this to be to is really sick
[27992.45s -> 27996.65s]  We lose a real one for this man listen you're a real one for this one
[27997.29s -> 27999.53s]  You just took the debt to save me
[28004.52s -> 28006.28s]  respect
[28006.28s -> 28012.73s]  You're real one for that
[28012.73s -> 28019.29s]  That was so good
[28019.29s -> 28022.49s]  Jesus was fun. Yeah, Jesus. You were the best support I've had today
[28022.93s -> 28027.13s]  Like legitimate. You played better than all the other players in the sealer. I was really good
[28027.33s -> 28033.21s]  Like I was surprised. I was telling my stream. I was like, yeah, this is actually like they I said cheeks here
[28033.21s -> 28035.21s]  I don't know, you know, but I was like yeah
[28035.97s -> 28039.45s]  She's playing super good. It's playing way better than all of my fucking teammates
[28044.30s -> 28046.30s]  Yo
[28046.30s -> 28048.94s]  What time is it it's six man?
[28048.94s -> 28059.04s]  So I want to keep streaming or do I want to go get food and go to the gym. I can't like 24 hours of fitness is not actually 24 or any more
[28059.44s -> 28068.12s]  So I have to go soon if I'm going to go to the gym. But it is only like six
[28079.13s -> 28082.82s]  But I could just end on
[28084.02s -> 28093.95s]  I could just end on the hitting the like 400 LP mark and just chill for now right like we have 400 LP will probably hit GM tomorrow
[28093.95s -> 28098.95s]  So I could just chill for now and then we could just hit GM tomorrow.
[28098.95s -> 28105.03s]  That's probably a better idea because then I won't get mad.
[28105.03s -> 28109.03s]  Like say we get another game like this, right?
[28109.03s -> 28114.03s]  Like say we get another game like this where like we're literally winning the game and my team's like,
[28114.03s -> 28115.03s]  No, let's forfeit.
[28115.03s -> 28116.03s]  Like that's gonna make me mad.
[28116.03s -> 28117.03s]  I was mad.
[28117.03s -> 28118.03s]  This is gonna make me mad, right?
[28118.03s -> 28121.03s]  Like I, so I'd rather just like get off on a good note.
[28121.03s -> 28122.03s]  Like happy note.
[28122.03s -> 28123.03s]  You know, like not be tilted.
[28123.03s -> 28130.02s]  GM tomorrow?
[28130.02s -> 28131.02s]  Yeah, I hope so.
[28131.02s -> 28133.82s]  So, I think I can get challenged back this year,
[28133.82s -> 28136.42s]  but we gotta get to GM first.
[28136.42s -> 28139.50s]  I'm telling you, this ELO is so miserable.
[28139.50s -> 28144.34s]  Like, Master's here is the worst ELO I've ever played
[28144.34s -> 28149.34s]  in my 12 years of playing this game.
[28149.34s -> 28154.34s]  Whatever NA 300 400 LP Masters is is literally disgusting.
[28156.66s -> 28159.62s]  These are not real people.
[28159.62s -> 28172.12s]  Like, I feel like half of these games we are playing with NPCs who quite literally don't even like I don't even know what to say of their bots and they can't be real humans.
[28172.12s -> 28179.12s]  They get mad over nothing. They rage quit over nothing. They give up at 15 minutes when we're winning the game.
[28179.12s -> 28188.93s]  These cannot be real people. So I swear to God, the game has to get better in GM. It has to get better.
[28188.93s -> 28191.93s]  There's no world that it gets worse.
[28192.93s -> 28194.93s]  Like I refuse to believe that.
[28195.93s -> 28198.93s]  Because this is this is the worst grind I've ever had.
[28198.93s -> 28206.69s]  Is it bad to be a pot?
[28206.69s -> 28207.69s]  Are you saying I'm boughtest?
[28207.69s -> 28213.26s]  I mean, can't tell me because I, because I, because I don't like bots.
[28213.26s -> 28214.26s]  I said it.
[28214.26s -> 28215.26s]  I'm saying it.
[28215.26s -> 28216.26s]  I don't like fucking bots.
[28216.26s -> 28218.26s]  Well, okay, didn't need to add fuck.
[28218.26s -> 28220.26s]  You know what, we're just going, I'm going to get off.
[28220.26s -> 28222.26s]  I'm going to, yeah, that's it for me.
[28222.26s -> 28224.26s]  I'm going to get off was.
[28224.26s -> 28225.26s]  I'm tired.
[28225.26s -> 28233.90s]  I need to go to the gym before I run out of juice make some dinner. I will be live tomorrow same time as today. I've been starting my stream at 10 a.m.
[28233.90s -> 28238.70s]  My time. Maybe I'll do it tomorrow at 9 a.m.
[28238.70s -> 28247.02s]  I don't know. It's 10 or 9. Between there I always start my stream. And so, and that's my time. So it's like 7 8 9 p.s.t.
[28248.06s -> 28254.22s]  You're good at it. Thanks, man. I think I suck. My goal is hopefully I can get challenged back.
[28255.26s -> 28259.34s]  and then I'm not gonna play, like I just want my goal is
[28259.34s -> 28264.30s]  challenger so that I can prove to myself. It's a really stupid thing,
[28264.30s -> 28267.42s]  but I want to prove to myself that I can still do it at 32,
[28267.42s -> 28270.46s]  because 10 years ago was the first time I started streaming this year, right?
[28270.46s -> 28274.06s]  I've been streaming for 10 years this year. And so I want to get challenger
[28275.18s -> 28277.90s]  because when I first started streaming, I was in challenger and I want to see
[28277.90s -> 28283.42s]  if like after 10 years, I can still do it and then I'm never going to care again.
[28283.42s -> 28286.76s]  this will be the only time I ever give a shit about getting
[28286.76s -> 28289.50s]  challenging. I just want to get it. See if I care and then
[28289.50s -> 28294.10s]  play for content, you know. But yeah, it's just, it's like
[28294.10s -> 28299.18s]  welcome to the League of Draven. See if the old man who has
[28299.18s -> 28303.26s]  fucking arthritis and fucking carpal tunnel and all that
[28303.26s -> 28307.38s]  shit, you know what I mean? See if I still do it. Yeah,
[28307.38s -> 28309.54s]  thank you for the twitch prime man. I appreciate it. Thank you
[28309.54s -> 28313.02s]  so much. Appreciate it a lot, dude. All right, guys, that's going
[28313.02s -> 28316.14s]  be it for me. If you like the stream, don't forget to follow all my socials and TikTok
[28316.14s -> 28319.58s]  and Facebook and Instagram and all that shit. All the clickable garbage is underneath the
[28319.58s -> 28325.66s]  stream, don't forget to check it out. I'll be back tomorrow, same time in the morning. I
[28325.90s -> 28329.90s]  tomorrow's my last day for the weekend, though. I'm not going to stream on Saturday. I might do
[28329.90s -> 28334.38s]  some off-stream grinding on Saturday. I've been taking, I've been like forcing myself to take a
[28334.38s -> 28339.82s]  day off of streaming every week, just so like I can mentally recharge. And I think it's actually
[28339.82s -> 28344.54s]  been really good for my stream because I've been in a much better mood while streaming and I've been
[28344.54s -> 28349.50s]  much else tilted and I've been even if I play League off stream or whatever it's just like
[28349.50s -> 28354.46s]  it doesn't feel as forced so I feel like the break's nice so yeah tomorrow no stream on Saturday
[28354.46s -> 28359.90s]  tomorrow for sure and Sunday I might I might do a short stream but yeah I'll see you guys then
[28359.90s -> 28366.18s]  thanks for watching I appreciate you guys and yeah that's it I'm gonna go make dinner
[28366.18s -> 28372.94s]  I hope you guys have a good night day, wherever the fuck you are, better dudes.
[28372.94s -> 28375.94s]  I hope you guys have a good one, I was fun playing with you in drama.
[28375.94s -> 28379.94s]  Go look on the games. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Peace.
