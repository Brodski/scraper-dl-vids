[190.19s -> 195.62s]  That guy has
[195.78s -> 207.54s]  GP
[207.54s -> 215.50s]  bees
[215.50s -> 254.09s]  Jesus
[254.09s -> 270.77s]  Yo, hey, what's up, man? What's up, dudes?
[318.94s -> 327.09s]  Yeah, I mean we're hoping we'll see you man. We'll see
[330.25s -> 390.83s]  Fingers fucking crossed right? Do I ever actually?
[392.15s -> 408.13s]  I'm wondering if I I'm assuming I'm just playing a math
[408.65s -> 463.22s]  No way. Hey
[463.70s -> 484.14s]  Yeah, this is probably just me doing fucking I'm probably just doing Star Guardian
[498.34s -> 502.54s]  Welcome to the y'all except for I'm drinking for the 27 months man. You're ah
[503.50s -> 530.98s]  Appreciate it a lot, dude. Thank you, and I could probably still go infinite team, but so I'm holding the solution
[531.72s -> 533.72s]  But I haven't seen any servers or anything
[534.80s -> 619.95s]  So I'd be kind of awkward, you know, this guy's definitely gonna beat me that guy's I
[621.03s -> 625.19s]  See why he hasn't lost. That's just five infinity team already. Jesus Christ. I
[626.27s -> 628.95s]  Was like man, why is that guy so strong and then I like realized
[629.55s -> 780.82s]  So I go to seven next rounds and then hopefully we can hit
[782.14s -> 806.36s]  some shit, I kind of like this actually because now we can make I
[807.64s -> 809.24s]  can actually make a
[809.24s -> 811.24s]  Guard breaker and I could also make
[811.76s -> 848.96s]  We go a guard breaker and math. I kind of want to just ionic spark, but I don't know if I should I need
[850.32s -> 852.32s]  an echo a
[852.40s -> 854.40s]  Niko or a rail
[854.40s -> 857.40s]  I also could use an Ezreal. I need like a quick draw.
[858.90s -> 860.90s]  I should have kept that Lucian from earlier.
[876.02s -> 880.02s]  This guy has a level 3 Blitzcrank and he's just so fucking strong it's stupid.
[949.42s -> 950.92s]  This is really interesting.
[956.06s -> 958.06s]  I guess I could go Spellslinger as well.
[975.23s -> 978.23s]  And we just give the Shiv to TF.
[1006.48s -> 1007.98s]  We can just do this for now too.
[1035.71s -> 1037.21s]  I guess I could use...
[1040.68s -> 1042.18s]  I could do Jeweled Gauntlet.
[1044.00s -> 1044.50s]  I don't know.
[1047.01s -> 1048.51s]  Could Jeweled Gauntlet this shit up?
[1049.01s -> 1050.01s]  See how it goes.
[1103.73s -> 1106.37s]  I need to, like, throw an item down.
[1106.37s -> 1110.94s]  But I feel like Morello's is bad.
[1110.94s -> 1117.72s]  I guess I could just use Hat.
[1117.72s -> 1128.10s]  Or, like I said before, Jeweled Gauntlet could be good.
[1128.10s -> 1145.28s]  I don't know.
[1145.28s -> 1147.04s]  I could just roll on seven, too.
[1147.04s -> 1152.78s]  Trying three-star stuff.
[1152.78s -> 1154.98s]  This guy has three Kaisas, though.
[1154.98s -> 1159.68s]  This guy has one Kaisa.
[1159.68s -> 1161.06s]  Kind of hard to three-star Kaisa.
[1161.06s -> 1190.74s]  I could three-star Nihila.
[1190.74s -> 1193.58s]  They got some eight with fucking 20 gold.
[1195.38s -> 1196.54s]  Here he has MF.
[1196.54s -> 1198.54s]  And
[1198.58s -> 1297.95s]  Your blitzcrank is insane
[1297.99s -> 1356.28s]  You that gnar just murked me. I
[1357.16s -> 1359.32s]  Did not position for the gnar and I got
[1360.48s -> 1402.62s]  Fucked for it this motherfucker. Did I wish I could get some thick frontline leveled up
[1403.66s -> 1418.94s]  That'd be cool
[1430.78s -> 1460.07s]  Oh my god another gnar
[1460.07s -> 1546.81s]  well rip I was gonna go MF and then I like decided to go Niko and then I just
[1546.81s -> 1595.94s]  fucked it all up oh well oh well time is at 10
[1618.71s -> 1635.70s]  what's up boys how's everybody doing oh I'll be right back
[1635.70s -> 1645.78s]  Sorry, I'm still waking up, let me, give me one sec.
[1645.78s -> 1647.78s]  What's up, Sky?
[1647.78s -> 1675.06s]  Oh, okay.
[1675.06s -> 1679.76s]  Woo!
[1679.76s -> 1680.76s]  Oh yeah, baby.
[1680.76s -> 1684.76s]  I was going to play on my main at the start, but dude, I don't know if I can sit through
[1684.76s -> 1687.76s]  fucking 8 minute queue times to get people raging at each other all day.
[1687.76s -> 1690.76s]  So we'll do some warm up on this account for a bit.
[1690.76s -> 1704.18s]  What, a Mars's account?
[1704.18s -> 1706.18s]  Like, D1 Lowmaster.
[1706.18s -> 1714.94s]  Like, my other account's like 500.
[1714.94s -> 1721.22s]  500 this one's I want to say like I don't know the MMR is really awkward when you get
[1721.22s -> 1725.46s]  like low masters right like the MMR super awkward so I don't know what the MMR is but
[1725.46s -> 1729.14s]  I know it's low masters so like sometimes there's diamonds sometimes there's like hundred
[1729.14s -> 1743.28s]  LP players somewhere between there dude I I played some games off stream yesterday
[1743.28s -> 1757.16s]  I got up to like 400 LP then I lost three in a row that shit was painful I did into
[1757.16s -> 1770.96s]  one of tenacity's games though so that was fun that felt bad no yeah straight
[1770.96s -> 1775.12s]  up it felt so bad he was doing so good too like I straight up just had a bad
[1775.12s -> 1781.15s]  game and I felt I felt like shit look at this shit I just dropped like eight
[1781.15s -> 1787.49s]  deaths look at the shits like he was just straight up smurfing on the enemy
[1787.49s -> 1792.95s]  top laner and we all the entire team just like decided to collectively run
[1792.95s -> 1804.60s]  it down like we all just got shit on this was a really weird game because I
[1804.60s -> 1811.03s]  feel like that game was like the first game I felt everybody in the game was
[1811.03s -> 1815.71s]  like actually high GM challenger but they weren't rated that it was a very
[1815.71s -> 1830.80s]  weird system going on let's do a Cassiopeia game like I'll show you
[1830.80s -> 1844.97s]  guys what I mean in a second I'm assuming I should go this right this
[1844.97s -> 1857.44s]  probably good or this that's probably good too oh well okay so yeah we'll get this stuff
[1858.72s -> 1864.48s]  like neon tanso is like he's been challenger for a long time right i don't even know who the
[1864.48s -> 1874.16s]  fuck this guy was some random senna player who's like not playing senna now and then this guy
[1874.16s -> 1879.12s]  was like trying to jungle and just like running it down it was i don't even know it was the
[1879.12s -> 1887.00s]  the weirdest game that I've played in a while because like my ad carry wasn't bad like this
[1887.00s -> 1890.32s]  guy's clearly like on a smurf but I don't know how good he was because he wasn't bad
[1890.32s -> 1898.44s]  at the game the enemy ad carry wasn't bad this guy's also on a smurf it was the weirdest
[1898.44s -> 1903.36s]  lobby it was like a bunch of smurf accounts all playing with each other but it was like
[1903.36s -> 1913.13s]  in non-smurf queue. This guy was like the only non-smurf. It was interesting.
[1922.83s -> 1929.15s]  Oh, do I take Ghost here? Or do I just... I feel like Ghost could be really OP versus their team
[1929.15s -> 1943.40s]  with Cassiopeia, but maybe I should just take... I'm gonna try it. Oh, somebody dodged.
[1943.40s -> 1946.28s]  Because yeah, I don't know. I never know. I never know if I should take Ghost, Ignite,
[1946.28s -> 1952.04s]  whatever. Because I feel like Ghost with Cassios feels like the same thing as AD carry, right?
[1952.04s -> 1966.46s]  same idea where it feels really op dude there's so much drama going on in the league community yet
[1966.46s -> 1998.56s]  again by the way like it's it's insane yeah i don't know man i i just i'm
[2005.04s -> 2011.68s]  i like i like looking at drama because like drama is juicy like i like looking at drama but it's
[2011.68s -> 2038.60s]  also like how are people so stupid yeah i'm getting like i i don't know man my view on all
[2038.60s -> 2046.36s]  of this shit is like i i guess i'm just not hardwired that way i i can't mentally wrap
[2046.36s -> 2056.06s]  my head around being like excited to flirt with underage girls or like when like i i just i i've
[2056.06s -> 2067.21s]  never like had the want like it happens so much between the like league streamers and non like
[2067.21s -> 2069.77s]  just it's not even a league thing it's just that we're in the league community right so you see it
[2069.77s -> 2077.61s]  more dude like well the the drama is like uh a decent size league streamer who was like getting
[2077.61s -> 2083.29s]  bigger or whatever like the ad carry streamer cookie or whatever he was like somebody made a
[2083.29s -> 2085.29s]  90 page
[2085.99s -> 2087.99s]  90 pages of
[2088.33s -> 2094.36s]  Google doc to basically like expose this guy for like
[2095.12s -> 2097.46s]  Talking a bunch like sexually to underage girls
[2098.16s -> 2103.58s]  Not paying his fucking like mods who do work for him and like other stuff and I'm like dude
[2111.78s -> 2113.42s]  How man?
[2113.42s -> 2122.28s]  Like just be a normal human. It's not that bad. Like take it from me
[2122.74s -> 2125.34s]  Being a normal dude. It's not that bad
[2125.42s -> 2208.15s]  Sorry, I was distracted. No, uh, yeah, I don't know man. I I swear to God people were just stupid as fuck people were idiots
[2210.11s -> 2215.59s]  There's got to be some psychological underlying issue with people's brains not working but it is what it is
[2216.23s -> 2221.26s]  Huh? I've had this mark on account for a while
[2225.16s -> 2237.52s]  Dude what is that Tarek skin? Let's see this. Look at this Tarek skin man. He's fabulous
[2237.92s -> 2242.92s]  Goddamn. My man's just straight up fabulous.
[2242.92s -> 2264.00s]  People are desperate. I just can't, like, I don't think, like, I've been in this situation where I was like a really, really big streamer.
[2264.00s -> 2270.00s]  Like, much bigger than he is. And I got, like, I, this is what I'm saying, is like, I understand
[2270.00s -> 2277.00s]  like, all of the crap that gets thrown at you, like, people will literally message you for no reason.
[2277.00s -> 2282.92s]  like you do have like fans that have like when I was at my biggest point like you you have fans
[2282.92s -> 2288.76s]  that are younger girls guy it doesn't matter and like you just gotta like I just never in my mind
[2288.76s -> 2293.64s]  I guess thought like oh I'm gonna flirt with these people like it made me like I don't even
[2293.64s -> 2303.95s]  I wouldn't even I literally didn't even see them as like sexual in my brain like it blows my
[2303.95s -> 2311.02s]  mind and then the fact that like if you like if you look at the google doc or whatever
[2311.90s -> 2316.28s]  The fact that like taco like I keep a taco whatever it was literally talking to him
[2316.66s -> 2320.16s]  Telling him he was doing it like what he was doing was wrong. He was like, yeah, I get it, right
[2320.70s -> 2322.70s]  Then he did it again
[2333.08s -> 2336.32s]  dude the set ulting the pussy that that
[2337.40s -> 2340.40s]  I'll be on it. That may be one of the funniest lines I've ever heard
[2355.08s -> 2359.40s]  Like dude, I mean whatever, you know, I'm not here to kink shame whatever gets people off, you know
[2359.40s -> 2362.44s]  Maybe maybe maybe that's a fetish. I don't know
[2394.91s -> 2399.70s]  Safe and sounds either way
[2401.10s -> 2403.10s]  Don't worry. We cannot talk about the drama real quick
[2403.82s -> 2405.82s]  we could talk about
[2406.86s -> 2434.93s]  How old and washed up wings death is though I'm kidding yo, did you see on a lighter note though? Did you see riot?
[2435.93s -> 2442.03s]  There was like a reddit thread or something where riot was saying that they're like gonna try and do something about smurfing in the next
[2442.03s -> 2445.51s]  Few months. I don't know what that means
[2447.59s -> 2448.71s]  But
[2448.71s -> 2457.27s]  Here's how it's something involving wings
[2457.83s -> 2463.67s]  Just between us. Yeah. Yeah, just between us and all the homies. Yeah in chat. Yeah. Yeah. No nobody else say anything. It's fine. Yeah, no
[2467.24s -> 2480.12s]  What's up? My chat ain't snitches
[2480.68s -> 2503.46s]  When I was a teen, I made a montage of him having breakdowns in my games. Oh my god
[2504.18s -> 2506.18s]  That's amazing. Oh
[2510.38s -> 2517.08s]  My god, that's amazing. I feel like I need to pay you to see this montage
[2518.14s -> 2520.14s]  Like I will give you money
[2521.38s -> 2549.21s]  Okay, I need this this is important to me. Oh, I have dude you should see that I I have so many rage compilations about me
[2549.21s -> 2550.73s]  It's crazy
[2550.73s -> 2557.83s]  So many I had a I had a villain arc for sure
[2557.83s -> 2567.35s]  I feel like it just comes with like being a league streamer
[2567.35s -> 2581.90s]  But you players are not all mentally healthy. Let me let me tell you take it from me
[2589.09s -> 2591.85s]  Chad, okay. I'd like to think I'm not a villain anymore
[2592.85s -> 2607.76s]  Fuck you. I really want this plate
[2609.22s -> 2626.46s]  Nice dude anivia's roaming. Why is there Wukong just sitting top by the way?
[2628.06s -> 2630.06s]  That's actually hilarious
[2630.82s -> 2645.90s]  You know, it's interesting. I feel like Tariq actually missed that stun. I
[2645.90s -> 2650.18s]  I was kind of side-eyeing that but I feel like you missed that stun somehow. I
[2671.74s -> 2674.18s]  Feel like this is the easiest game I've ever played by the way
[2674.70s -> 2676.70s]  I'm on full autopilot
[2676.90s -> 2681.94s]  Brain still waking up and I feel like they're just walking into me on repeat. I'm just killing them all I
[2682.66s -> 2684.66s]  Don't even know what the fuck's going on
[2685.54s -> 2690.80s]  Like they it feels like the enemy team has not like they didn't they didn't like understand we were playing league
[2691.26s -> 2693.70s]  Right, like they queued up and they were like, oh, yeah, this is league
[2693.70s -> 2695.70s]  That's what this feels like
[2697.70s -> 2701.70s]  This is what I imagine if like Mike Tyson went into a preschool, you know what I mean? Like this is what this feels like
[2721.76s -> 2723.76s]  much say I
[2733.62s -> 2735.62s]  probably could have killed those guys, but
[2736.94s -> 2749.35s]  One of the chill I'm assuming the Wukong is gonna come bot soon
[2754.46s -> 2755.98s]  There he is
[2755.98s -> 2764.15s]  Damn it. I quenched late. I
[2764.75s -> 2766.75s]  actually kill both
[2767.03s -> 2769.03s]  That's a late cleanse by me
[2769.23s -> 2771.23s]  my bad
[2771.35s -> 2773.69s]  Mmm, I don't want to take the risk coming back up
[2774.83s -> 2779.47s]  She stuns me they can one-shot me. I should have killed the fucking guy though
[2780.99s -> 2785.27s]  The Wukong I just backed up too far and then I cleansed the stun for no like really late
[2794.88s -> 2797.02s]  Hi, Jared. Hey, what's up, man? What's up, boys?
[2797.64s -> 2802.10s]  Good evening. Good evening. Good morning. I don't know where the fuck you guys live. So good day
[2815.13s -> 2825.79s]  Fuck am I watching?
[2825.79s -> 2827.79s]  Wait that Wukong lived
[2832.84s -> 2837.08s]  Whoa, bro. Oh, I'm dead
[2837.10s -> 2846.22s]  dude that wall was BS there was like a little hole and then I flashed late because I was
[2846.22s -> 2854.62s]  like oh I could walk out the hole but I couldn't walk out the tiny little hole motherfuckers
[2854.62s -> 2863.33s]  I shouldn't have even been there but like I'm stupid I should just push bot I was
[2863.33s -> 2866.17s]  like dude that's such a bad fight but I walked over to it I was like I'm really
[2866.17s -> 2870.81s]  Honestly, I probably could have killed him if I hadn't uh, if I had like flashed the
[2872.25s -> 2882.04s]  stun. Annie stun is the only like most over like I swear if they reduced Annie stun by like 0.5
[2882.04s -> 2889.32s]  seconds she would never get played. Like actually the only reason to play Annie is her stun is
[2889.32s -> 2895.16s]  just so OP because it's like a it's like the reason they changed Taric so long ago where like
[2895.16s -> 2902.82s]  Like when you have a point click CC, it's typically really broken.
[2902.82s -> 2914.10s]  Okay, I'm just dead.
[2914.10s -> 2921.89s]  Does Taric not have ult leveled up at 6?
[2921.89s -> 2941.12s]  He didn't level his ulti.
[2941.12s -> 2945.45s]  Maybe it's, maybe Taric ult sucks.
[2945.45s -> 2947.41s]  Maybe it's underpowered, you know?
[2947.41s -> 2950.45s]  No, yeah, he must have misclicked.
[2950.45s -> 2960.66s]  Honestly, I'm just briefing.
[2960.66s -> 2965.66s]  I'm like playing too aggro for like, like I, I threw my lead because I was
[2965.66s -> 2969.50s]  like oh shit i'm gonna walk over and help the homies you never walk over and help the homies when
[2969.50s -> 2974.86s]  the homies are getting shit on because uh if you have like 900 gold or a thousand gold lead
[2974.86s -> 2980.22s]  like like i did or whatever you don't want to do that because you'll give mf a ton of kills
[2983.60s -> 2998.30s]  we're in a good spot now though but i am still a little wait taric oh he leveled his ult nice
[3000.77s -> 3006.59s]  this taric does not know how to play taric by the way he's throwing out his stun so
[3006.59s -> 3013.87s]  awkwardly. That's okay though. I mean I apparently don't know how to play Draven so
[3018.35s -> 3027.39s]  can't really blame the guy. I mean you guys are doing dragon with no smite.
[3031.41s -> 3046.61s]  But it seems like doing dragon with no smite. I mean we could fight these fights but
[3048.53s -> 3057.55s]  it's like painful. We could easily fight these fights. I think a lot of it is just like
[3058.43s -> 3062.51s]  Taric isn't confident enough to walk up and stun right like that's that's what I'm seeing
[3062.51s -> 3066.83s]  the issue is he's doing the thing where like he's not uh he doesn't have the confidence to actually
[3066.83s -> 3075.65s]  walk up since he's a melee champ so he's walking up and like taking half his health uh and it's
[3075.65s -> 3084.21s]  making him nervous it happens a lot with players uh who aren't very melee champ centric because
[3084.21s -> 3098.42s]  melee supports are actually pretty risky or they're pretty scary rather oh he's totally
[3098.42s -> 3103.86s]  dead oh no maybe not but yeah melee supports are scary to play uh because you have to know
[3105.38s -> 3108.10s]  when you can get a kill by going in because you're gonna take damage right
[3110.02s -> 3119.95s]  that's just like the nature of melee supports nice we're coming back in a bit not bad
[3121.23s -> 3124.51s]  we threw a little bit early but yeah we're starting to get it back we're showing
[3124.51s -> 3133.98s]  I'm always confused by Taric because he feels like such a good champion, like the champion
[3133.98s -> 3137.98s]  itself feels broken as shit.
[3137.98s -> 3146.04s]  Like whenever I see Taric, I think to myself like, he's either unkillably like super OP
[3146.04s -> 3151.70s]  or they're like 0 and 10.
[3151.70s -> 3152.70s]  There's no in between, right?
[3152.70s -> 3155.46s]  Like they either know how to play Taric or they don't, is what it feels like.
[3155.46s -> 3172.64s]  Oh, you I mean, yeah, you are wrong Tarek actually requires mechanics
[3174.24s -> 3176.24s]  That's actually true
[3176.52s -> 3182.00s]  Where's like most supports like not always doesn't have mechanics, you know and like what's crank doesn't have mechanics
[3182.00s -> 3185.76s]  They just hit their button and if it if it works, they they get a kill
[3188.12s -> 3210.78s]  Where's like Tarek after you stun there is like stuff you have to do that doesn't make sense or block do you think?
[3211.78s -> 3213.78s]  I'm gonna die. Oh
[3213.78s -> 3222.45s]  Oh, thank god, do you think Tarek's one of the harder supports? I think he's I think he's pretty hard
[3225.15s -> 3228.39s]  Like I don't think he's well, I mean he's harder than the other supports
[3228.39s -> 3231.87s]  Like I think like I don't think there's a single support. That's hard. I
[3232.75s -> 3235.17s]  know I'm I'm toxic for that, but I
[3236.07s -> 3241.43s]  Stand by it. Oh
[3242.59s -> 3260.98s]  I'm just gonna die. I'm not gonna turn flash. I don't think I should have just flashed over
[3260.98s -> 3267.12s]  But I kind of got baited by the taric olt. I wanted to see like if I could fight but there's too much CC. I
[3268.00s -> 3270.00s]  Was like, oh, he's ulting me. Let's go. I
[3271.94s -> 3275.74s]  Can tell this is a really low evil game because there's so much random deaths
[3275.74s -> 3282.54s]  Like I'm falling victim to like I'm autopiloting and like I'm not thinking and I'm just talking to you guys and I'm just dying
[3282.54s -> 3287.14s]  For free, but it's like there's so many people just dying for free. It's the whole area
[3287.66s -> 3290.68s]  Thresh Thresh isn't actually that harm. So
[3292.36s -> 3297.68s]  Like a lot of people think like Thresh mechanically is very difficult because he is harder than the other supports
[3297.82s -> 3300.48s]  But he's not actually that hard. He's like
[3301.04s -> 3304.64s]  once you learn the Thresh combos, he's pretty much a
[3305.98s -> 3307.98s]  very upfront champion
[3312.59s -> 3317.38s]  Yeah, like
[3317.38s -> 3323.12s]  Like lantern for example is one of the most broken things to ever be put in league and everybody fucks it up
[3323.78s -> 3328.24s]  Like people will will just mess up lantern because they'll throw it for souls or they'll mess up
[3328.24s -> 3330.72s]  Like you can literally just hold lantern perma
[3331.60s -> 3333.60s]  And your ad carry can walk up
[3334.80s -> 3339.12s]  Auto the turret and and and you literally like they literally can't play the game after that
[3345.42s -> 3348.54s]  Like the enemy team i'm in because like there's nothing they can do to stop it
[3350.72s -> 3352.72s]  We can totally fight this by the way
[3353.60s -> 3357.20s]  So like i've done that before we're like my thresh. Well, I know I have a good throw. Hold on
[3357.20s -> 3359.20s]  Let me let me win this teamfight really quick
[3360.56s -> 3384.02s]  Give me a sec
[3384.02s -> 3390.02s]  Okay, cool. Sorry, I had to win that team fight real quick. Okay. So as I was saying, uh, there's a lot more to thresh than
[3391.38s -> 3393.54s]  People think right
[3393.54s -> 3397.22s]  It's essentially people over complicate like what he needs to do
[3397.70s -> 3400.74s]  So it's like thresh is a very basic like when you see thresh in pro play
[3401.14s -> 3404.58s]  You you don't ever see like what you do, but it's very rare that you see like the sick
[3405.30s -> 3410.34s]  Permahooking like oh my god, like it's mainly like they pick him for like lantern
[3411.62s -> 3412.90s]  straight up
[3412.90s -> 3416.50s]  Like when they when they pick Thresh in high elo, he's not picked to be the god tier like
[3416.98s -> 3424.26s]  always landing perma CC hooks like flay god like he's picked to like shut down engage and uh remove
[3425.70s -> 3428.02s]  Kill threat to your carries that's all he's picked for
[3430.88s -> 3432.88s]  But he's literally just an ew bot
[3435.07s -> 3439.95s]  Armor stacking. I mean, yeah, the armor thing on thresh is nice, but it's I wouldn't say it's like op on his kit
[3442.69s -> 3446.05s]  It just makes him like not die to 80 carries in two seconds
[3446.05s -> 3453.94s]  What is happening?
[3453.94s -> 3462.16s]  But I instantly know I'm playing with a good Thresh player when I can walk up to the turret.
[3462.16s -> 3477.00s]  When I can walk up to the turret and the Thresh- sorry I was trying to think and talk
[3477.00s -> 3478.24s]  at the same time.
[3478.24s -> 3481.04s]  When I can walk up to the turret, my Thresh player won't walk up and auto the turret
[3481.04s -> 3482.04s]  with me.
[3482.04s -> 3484.44s]  That's like the sign of a good Thresh player.
[3484.44s -> 3487.60s]  When we don't know where the enemy is and instead of walking up and trying to hit
[3487.60s -> 3491.38s]  the turret to like help you kill the turret, they'll stand in the back and literally
[3491.38s -> 3498.90s]  just sit there and wait and hold lantern until uh they just hold their lantern until like you can
[3499.86s -> 3507.09s]  until you get ganked essentially and that's why like i said i i just personally don't think
[3507.09s -> 3511.89s]  thresh's mechanics are as hard as people think i do think he's he's very knowledge based like
[3511.89s -> 3516.93s]  i think thresh has high knowledge caps where like if you're playing i don't know like lulu
[3517.49s -> 3521.81s]  your skill is basically like do i w your your decision making on lulu is literally
[3521.81s -> 3527.27s]  Do I W to speed or do I W to CC? Right like that's your that's your like decision-making
[3527.61s -> 3530.23s]  so it's like obviously much higher than that, but
[3531.01s -> 3532.85s]  it's a
[3532.85s -> 3536.13s]  You son of a bitch
[3536.13s -> 3543.45s]  But it's still not like that bad. I think Thresh just intimidates people because he can do so much
[3544.37s -> 3549.37s]  And so I think people just get intimidated but because they think it looks overwhelming to learn the champ. I
[3549.37s -> 3558.24s]  I feel like that actually intimidates a lot of people in terms of like people not wanting to
[3558.80s -> 3560.80s]  learn new champions and shits.
[3561.76s -> 3563.76s]  I feel like a lot of it is just
[3565.96s -> 3568.68s]  People are nervous about learning champions that look overwhelming
[3569.36s -> 3572.30s]  Right?
[3572.30s -> 3577.94s]  Like Aphelios for example, I was talking about this yesterday. Aphelios is not a hard mechanical champion.
[3578.52s -> 3580.52s]  He's difficult in terms of
[3581.36s -> 3584.56s]  the knowledge required. Like he's knowledge gated very hard.
[3585.16s -> 3591.62s]  Right. So like you have to play him a decent amount or like research him to understand what guns do what?
[3591.84s -> 3596.84s]  How to interact with the guns stuff like that, right? But the actual mechanics of using the guns
[3597.52s -> 3599.52s]  It's actually not hard
[3600.16s -> 3615.17s]  Guys, what are we doing? I guess we're just winning the fight
[3615.81s -> 3619.85s]  like
[3619.85s -> 3623.29s]  Like like I think pikes harder than thresh
[3626.18s -> 3629.22s]  Maybe that's a hot take but I think pike is harder than thresh
[3629.22s -> 3640.18s]  because Pyke requires like really specific... Pyke is a lot harder to play than he looks
[3640.18s -> 3648.24s]  when you see people play him because there's like timers of when you can go in off of certain
[3648.24s -> 3652.52s]  things like hitting his ulti consistently in teamfights is a little harder than people think
[3652.52s -> 3658.58s]  and knowing how to position in the lane like Pyke is capable of a lot more than people think
[3658.58s -> 3669.45s]  I think the main reason I think Pyke's a little harder is because he's melee.
[3669.45s -> 3675.13s]  Melee champions are always going to be mechanically more difficult than ranged if the melee champion
[3675.13s -> 3682.72s]  is like, you have to engage to go in and do stuff because there's always the counter
[3682.72s -> 3692.24s]  play factor, support role, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[3692.24s -> 3697.12s]  I'm not saying overall, overall ranged champions require a lot more mechanics than melee.
[3697.12s -> 3701.28s]  because you're ranged you can die in a global and you have to space and stuff but I think
[3701.28s -> 3705.72s]  that like in just the support you support support specific I think melees are a lot
[3705.72s -> 3711.48s]  harder to play that's why you see a lot of like support players we give like the best
[3711.48s -> 3714.96s]  support players in the world are really good at like the engage melee supports not
[3714.96s -> 3719.12s]  the like enchanters and that's why you see like why we praise the best support
[3719.12s -> 3726.40s]  players because like when you see somebody go in like perfectly on Rakan or go in like
[3726.40s -> 3734.38s]  find a way in without getting knocked up on like I don't know something like when they
[3734.38s -> 3748.08s]  find the angle on thrash and shit it's really nice.
[3748.08s -> 3750.52s]  Rell I think Rell sucks.
[3750.52s -> 3761.82s]  I think that champ is so bad because she just like she doesn't do anything.
[3761.82s -> 3767.02s]  Like Rell's Rell's initial thing was like she was supposed to go in be really tanky
[3767.02s -> 3771.30s]  and then be like a stun bot for like team fights she was a team fight monster.
[3771.30s -> 3776.94s]  The problem with Rell is that she has one chance essentially in lane phase, like if anybody
[3776.94s -> 3783.74s]  has fingers on their hands and they can move left and right, Rell is really easy to dodge.
[3783.74s -> 3787.62s]  It's incredibly easy to beat a Rell in lane to not die to her.
[3787.62s -> 3789.58s]  You just have to move left and right, right?
[3789.58s -> 3791.02s]  It's very simple.
[3791.02s -> 3798.58s]  So it's much more difficult to dodge other engaged champs if that makes sense.
[3798.58s -> 3802.02s]  Nautilus, you can still move left and right, but he can walk at you while it's
[3802.02s -> 3803.02s]  happening.
[3803.02s -> 3808.74s]  like if Rell walks at you I'm still like just waiting for the animation and then I can simply
[3808.74s -> 3815.10s]  move to the left because like her animation is so slow on using her ability that I can
[3815.10s -> 3820.42s]  like dash I can flash I can there's so much counter play and it's like unless she flashes
[3820.42s -> 3825.10s]  on you but it's even then you can tell she's gonna flash on you so it's like I
[3825.10s -> 3831.38s]  also feel like mid game Rell has this issue where she has her one trick ulti engage
[3831.38s -> 3835.30s]  fight in teamfights, but after she does that, she does literally nothing.
[3835.30s -> 3837.87s]  Right?
[3837.87s -> 3841.42s]  She's like a one and done.
[3841.42s -> 3851.10s]  That's why she feels like she doesn't have other expression.
[3851.10s -> 3853.90s]  She's countered so hard by the meta too.
[3853.90s -> 3856.90s]  Meleeo counters rel and gage.
[3856.90s -> 3859.14s]  Thresh counters rel and gage.
[3859.14s -> 3860.14s]  Right?
[3860.14s -> 3876.02s]  Like, either of those champions shits on rel and gage and you can't do anything.
[3876.02s -> 3880.10s]  Like I don't know if you've ever tried to play rel, gone in and been like, Thresh
[3880.10s -> 3888.74s]  flash flayed, but it's the worst feeling. It's a bad feeling. It's like when people
[3888.74s -> 3893.46s]  play Leona. It's the same reason Leona is shit right now. Like, they both have the
[3893.46s -> 3898.42s]  same idea of why they're bad, right? They like have, they're both good at doing what
[3898.42s -> 3901.90s]  they're supposed to do. Like, you know, stun and create pressure and point click
[3901.90s -> 3908.34s]  and shit. But the problem is, is like, you can easily counterpick them so incredibly
[3908.34s -> 3910.74s]  hard that they just become worthless the whole game.
[3910.74s -> 3916.15s]  Have you ever gotten Senna's secondary mission?
[3916.15s -> 3917.83s]  Oh, all the time.
[3917.83s -> 3921.63s]  With Senna being like with Thresh being meta and Senna being like a champion I'm playing
[3921.63s -> 3926.07s]  a lot I get that all the time.
[3926.07s -> 3929.31s]  You don't even notice it though, I'm gonna be real.
[3929.31s -> 3931.79s]  When you kill the Thresh or whatever and you get his souls you don't even fucking
[3931.79s -> 3940.07s]  notice it because like it's like 40 armor and it's like you're level 17 or some
[3940.07s -> 3941.07s]  shit at that point.
[3941.07s -> 3946.29s]  Like at the point you're getting it you're such a high level that like the 40 random
[3946.29s -> 3958.66s]  I've never really noticed this in the game.
[3958.66s -> 3960.42s]  You know what I've been doing?
[3960.42s -> 3975.23s]  I've been roaming non stop and it's super OP.
[3975.23s -> 3982.09s]  Because the key to roaming is all you have to do to roam well is literally be there
[3982.09s -> 3985.27s]  one or two times in the first five minutes of the game.
[3985.27s -> 3988.75s]  to completely fuck over the enemy one time
[3988.75s -> 3990.35s]  on an engage or something.
[3990.35s -> 3992.63s]  And they get so far behind from it
[3992.63s -> 3998.52s]  that you can literally just walk back bot.
[3998.52s -> 3999.90s]  Like I do on Senna.
[3999.90s -> 4001.16s]  Like I'll push bot lane.
[4001.16s -> 4002.18s]  This is my strategy on Senna.
[4002.18s -> 4003.84s]  I'm gonna give it to you guys, okay?
[4003.84s -> 4006.48s]  So I don't know if this works in low elo,
[4006.48s -> 4007.82s]  but in like masters,
[4007.82s -> 4009.82s]  like high masters this works at least.
[4010.94s -> 4011.98s]  This is all I do on Senna.
[4011.98s -> 4014.66s]  Every single player I play against on Senna,
[4014.66s -> 4016.70s]  every single one except for like pike players,
[4016.70s -> 4017.86s]  even Nautilus, Blitz,
[4017.86s -> 4020.14s]  they all can seed lane level one.
[4020.14s -> 4021.26s]  Every single one of them, right?
[4021.26s -> 4023.98s]  They just, they just let me push level one.
[4023.98s -> 4026.52s]  And so I'll push the waves in level one
[4026.52s -> 4029.38s]  and I'll either crash wave two or wave three,
[4029.38s -> 4032.46s]  depending on how far they're giving me like push power,
[4032.46s -> 4033.30s]  right?
[4033.30s -> 4036.14s]  So I will always crash wave two or wave three bot
[4036.14s -> 4041.14s]  and I will immediately roam mid every time.
[4043.08s -> 4047.02s]  And even if I don't get a kill,
[4047.02s -> 4051.98s]  Usually it fucks over the enemy mid laner so badly because on that exact timer
[4052.74s -> 4056.62s]  There's usually a gank happening on mid
[4057.06s -> 4067.76s]  So a lot of the time people think that you're roaming to get a kill for the laner. You're not you're roaming to counter
[4068.28s -> 4074.91s]  Pressure from the other players in the game. How many times have you guys been like?
[4074.91s -> 4078.55s]  Oh, we can win this 2v2 you see the enemy jungler your jungler comes
[4078.55s -> 4081.51s]  You're like, oh, we're gonna bait this and then all of a sudden the support shows up
[4081.63s -> 4083.31s]  and you're like, God damn it.
[4083.31s -> 4085.79s]  And then you die and you're like, what the fuck?
[4085.79s -> 4088.75s]  That right there is how easy it is to play support
[4088.75s -> 4093.71s]  because all you have to do is show up once, twice.
[4093.71s -> 4102.26s]  And now that entire lane is fucked for the enemy team.
[4102.26s -> 4103.96s]  Roaming is so easy.
[4103.96s -> 4106.76s]  The only thing, people fuck up roaming really bad
[4106.76s -> 4108.40s]  when they roam on timers
[4108.40s -> 4111.30s]  where their AD carry can't safely farm.
[4111.30s -> 4113.66s]  So what ends up happening is on that timer, right?
[4113.66s -> 4116.30s]  Where like I told you wave two, three, right?
[4116.30s -> 4119.58s]  What happens is you push that wave in, you roam mid.
[4119.58s -> 4121.16s]  Let's say nothing happens, okay?
[4121.16s -> 4123.32s]  I can just walk back bot.
[4123.32s -> 4125.14s]  It's, you lose nothing.
[4125.14s -> 4126.78s]  And if usually at that point, you're not,
[4126.78s -> 4127.90s]  you have like 300 gold,
[4127.90s -> 4129.48s]  so there's no point in backing, right?
[4129.48s -> 4130.64s]  Now let's say like,
[4130.64s -> 4134.28s]  I noticed that my jungler is like invading top side.
[4134.28s -> 4136.30s]  I just walk over to top and help him.
[4137.54s -> 4140.36s]  Because you have like three to four,
[4140.36s -> 4141.98s]  you have like three to four waves
[4141.98s -> 4143.74s]  before the enemy bot lane.
[4143.74s -> 4155.94s]  The enemy bot lane has to play it almost perfectly to be able to abuse your roam on certain timers.
[4155.94s -> 4158.86s]  They essentially have to play it perfect to abuse the roam.
[4158.86s -> 4163.54s]  What I mean by that is like the way the best way to abuse support roaming is you either
[4163.54s -> 4171.34s]  A if you have the ability to dive you can pretty much A immediately dive like push
[4171.34s -> 4174.58s]  the next wave and then immediately dive if you like have that ability say you're
[4174.58s -> 4178.78s]  playing Reowna Draven or something. But even then it's a little risky because then the
[4178.78s -> 4183.80s]  AD carry can just walk back and they only lose one wave and you gave up a stack chance
[4183.80s -> 4190.14s]  so it's not that bad. Two, you can stack the wave. Now stacking the wave is the best way
[4190.14s -> 4194.82s]  to counter it because let's say I'm roaming for an extended period, you stack like a
[4194.82s -> 4199.02s]  three wave and then all of a sudden you're crashing it and then you're up a level
[4199.02s -> 4202.82s]  because you've been gaining XP and the AD carry has to back off. But the way to
[4202.82s -> 4207.22s]  counter that is you simply just walk back on the timer of the stacked wave
[4207.22s -> 4211.82s]  crashing as an AD carry or as a support. It's so incredibly easy to do. It's
[4211.82s -> 4218.18s]  actually brainlessly easy to do. Like all it's literally you can roam all you
[4218.18s -> 4222.70s]  want bot lane as long as you are in bot lane for the stacked wave crashes
[4222.70s -> 4230.93s]  or you are in bot lane when your jungler is bot side of the map. It's
[4230.93s -> 4237.75s]  easy as fuck. But support players drool on themselves so they like to
[4237.75s -> 4244.55s]  essentially support players like to like afk in the lane phase they like to literally sit there
[4245.11s -> 4251.91s]  and just do nothing that's like the average support i see is they will stand and do nothing
[4254.70s -> 4258.30s]  and and i've said this before but i'll say it again being a good support is not being a better
[4258.30s -> 4262.30s]  player in the enemy team being a good support is queuing up to play league of legends
[4263.90s -> 4267.82s]  that's that's all it takes all it takes to be a good support is queuing up with the
[4267.82s -> 4503.70s]  intent to push buttons in the game and not just afk all right i'm back what's up i don't remember
[4503.70s -> 4513.29s]  what we're talking about oh supports yeah they're all stupid don't afk on support you'll gain lp
[4513.29s -> 4530.25s]  so it's that it's actually that easy honestly i don't think supports are stupid i think it's
[4530.25s -> 4538.22s]  more of a uh how do i phrase this it's uh in my opinion it's more of like uh they're like
[4538.22s -> 4546.83s]  They've never they don't have to learn support boys like don't have to learn
[4548.13s -> 4553.09s]  Important things because they can get away with not doing it. So they get they develop bad habits. That's all it is
[4553.61s -> 4564.41s]  Do a Spotify playlist
[4564.45s -> 4570.70s]  Yeah, best role to climb. I
[4571.78s -> 4574.42s]  Think every role is good to climb as long as you're good
[4575.14s -> 4577.14s]  Classic Jara. Oh, I don't see
[4577.42s -> 4581.38s]  Whatever you linked like I don't know about links in the chat because I had to turn them off a long time ago
[4581.38s -> 4592.44s]  so I can't see it. I would say that climbing is just about like whatever
[4592.44s -> 4596.80s]  because every role you can climb on right like every single role so climbing
[4596.80s -> 4606.10s]  a lot of the time is just about what you think is most fun for you and you
[4606.10s -> 4612.42s]  can get the best at. I would say objectively the best roles to climb on
[4612.42s -> 4618.62s]  are jungle and support for just like higher elo well jungle and lower elo
[4618.62s -> 4624.86s]  support in higher elo. I wouldn't climb on support in like gold because you're
[4624.86s -> 4629.90s]  not gonna have a good time trying to like help bad players play the game. Bad
[4629.90s -> 4635.22s]  it's mean. People who don't like you can get it like a gold Ezreal 30 kills by
[4635.22s -> 4639.06s]  being the better support but you won't always win. Whereas like if you really
[4639.06s -> 4643.12s]  want to control solo queue and your teammates aren't like good enough to
[4643.12s -> 4646.98s]  carry at that level by themselves right like you get frustrated just
[4646.98s -> 4661.02s]  just pick something that has more agency in the game. You lost 18-24 as jungle, you want
[4661.02s -> 4667.46s]  to try any role? I mean you can play AD, if you think it's, AD carry is interesting.
[4667.46s -> 4680.88s]  I wouldn't say it's like fun, but it's not bad. You're in gold. I mean you could try
[4680.88s -> 4685.38s]  it. My view on it is if people are wondering if they want to play a role or not, my
[4685.38s -> 4688.34s]  view is just try it, see if you like it. Because if you don't like the role, you're
[4688.34s -> 4692.70s]  not gonna be able to put in enough games to get good at the role right so like just give
[4692.70s -> 4696.78s]  it a try see if you enjoy it or not and if like it's not fun then if it's not your play
[4696.78s -> 4703.14s]  style it's not fun because 80s are very unique play style from all the other roles like
[4703.14s -> 4709.38s]  they're the reason people don't like playing ad carry and like like watching ad carry streamers
[4709.38s -> 4719.97s]  and shit is because it any carry is like it's boring any carries like zero like
[4719.97s -> 4723.73s]  Like if there was a graph of shit going on when you're playing ad carry in the game, it's like this
[4724.37s -> 4727.41s]  Then it's like spikes to a hundred and then it's back to like this, right?
[4728.53s -> 4731.82s]  It's like
[4731.82s -> 4735.10s]  Ad carry is a lot of every game is different
[4736.14s -> 4738.14s]  Right every game when you play 80 is different
[4739.50s -> 4741.50s]  uh because
[4741.98s -> 4747.18s]  You're always with a different player like a different support unless you do oq. So every ad carries game's difference
[4747.90s -> 4749.90s]  coupled with uh
[4749.90s -> 4753.98s]  You spend a lot of the game just farming, like you don't get to interact with the enemy a lot
[4754.58s -> 4756.58s]  so you just kind of farm a lot of the game and
[4757.10s -> 4759.10s]  even then you also like
[4760.06s -> 4764.22s]  You basically are farming for like little dopamine hits of like team fights and stuff that you get around the game
[4764.22s -> 4771.02s]  So that's kind of fun, but it's like I said, it's all you you can climb on any role
[4771.02s -> 4775.06s]  I think 80 carry requires the most mechanical skill to climb because
[4775.78s -> 4777.78s]  the difference between
[4778.30s -> 4781.06s]  Climbing is like a jungler is about being in the right spot at the right time, right?
[4781.06s -> 4787.58s]  Like you need to path this way get objectives etc climbing as an ad carry is more about like this person fucked up their positioning
[4787.58s -> 4813.44s]  I'm gonna kill them type shit. I can't start a queue
[4818.26s -> 4820.26s]  Also, I want to I want to say something
[4820.62s -> 4823.36s]  if you are playing
[4824.14s -> 4828.38s]  Make sure and this is just a really good standardized bit of advice
[4828.90s -> 4833.26s]  Make sure you're always tracking what the enemy cooldowns are what their spells are stuff like that's
[4833.26s -> 4840.80s]  Okay, because playing the game is not just about like farming and you know
[4840.80s -> 4843.88s]  Like your team goes into you auto and shits like right now mids mia, right?
[4843.88s -> 4849.34s]  I can see that varus is mia, but it is a varus. So like I'm not too worried about being like level 2'd by a varus
[4850.04s -> 4853.80s]  Not that much right so I can kind of play backward because I know that
[4854.90s -> 4859.08s]  It's a high chance. He's not gonna run bottom level 2 as a varus now that was like a fizz or some shit
[4859.08s -> 4860.54s]  I immediately back up
[4860.54s -> 4865.16s]  So we noticed that it's pretty obvious Rakan probably got W level 2. We don't know what it is
[4865.54s -> 4877.23s]  but he has Q so he doesn't have shield which means because he doesn't have shield uh it's hard for
[4877.23s -> 4881.71s]  the recon to get back out if he fucks up and engage so you need to think about these type
[4881.71s -> 4887.31s]  of things right now this is wave four i believe and because it's wave four we're gonna get level
[4887.31s -> 4894.59s]  three on wave four you always get level three on wave four if you have full xp you get level
[4894.59s -> 4901.55s]  two on wave two and you get level three on wave four and uh these timers for when you get
[4902.83s -> 4911.12s]  certain level ups bot lane are very important now i'm gonna hover over here uh you see how fiddle
[4911.12s -> 4915.68s]  is right here i'm actually gonna just walk in here and see if i can like
[4917.28s -> 4923.36s]  yeah we see him nice see this is exactly what i was talking about before do you see what my
[4923.36s -> 4931.52s]  support is doing I I left the lane guys I walked to like stand next to my
[4931.52s -> 4938.96s]  jungler after we pushed the wave in my Lulu is hanging out by herself bot lane
[4938.96s -> 4961.81s]  but she's just chilling you don't want to do that you don't ever want to be
[4961.81s -> 4968.83s]  the guy who's like by yourself bot lane as a support because you don't know
[4968.83s -> 4973.31s]  like supports don't need gold right? Not really. And you don't need farm you don't
[4973.31s -> 4976.95s]  need all that shit. So if your ad carry roams and unless the wave is fucked and
[4976.95s -> 4979.59s]  they're just being stupid you have to fix the wave or something you don't
[4979.59s -> 4986.07s]  want to be by yourself in the lane. It just doesn't do anything. How do they
[4986.07s -> 4991.99s]  not auto tower? Oh I used Tilda. So there's a way there's actually a
[4991.99s -> 4996.11s]  setting you can have in the game where when you hit a button it makes
[4996.11s -> 5002.35s]  it so that i can't physically hit anything but a champion it's target it's called target champions
[5002.35s -> 5006.43s]  only and it's basically like here i'll do it for you right now watch you see how like i can hit
[5006.43s -> 5013.87s]  the tower you see how it's the red sword what so when i hit this button i can no longer hit the
[5013.87s -> 5021.95s]  tower or the minions but i can still hit the champions so essentially when you're fighting
[5021.95s -> 5027.79s]  in a big minion wave or you're fighting under a turret you don't want to misclick you just hit
[5027.79s -> 5032.67s]  target champions only button and it makes it a thousand times easier because you can literally
[5032.67s -> 5049.55s]  only hit the champion it's really nice and you can make the button anything you want obviously
[5049.55s -> 5059.80s]  i just i use tilde that's the default i actually want to kill these guys but i need
[5059.80s -> 5064.28s]  the wave for the wave to push out just a hair the jungler could be bought but it is a
[5064.28s -> 5067.96s]  fiddlestick so it's like i don't really care about a fiddlesticks being bought we can straight
[5067.96s -> 5089.32s]  up just kill them okay well apparently we can't kill them because apparently my lulu didn't want
[5089.32s -> 5098.44s]  to walk up that's so frustrating man i did fuck up my uh my auto there but i am a little i i am
[5098.44s -> 5103.40s]  kind of curious what happens i'd have to go watch the vod i fucked up my kill in the ziya i think i
[5103.40s -> 5109.08s]  walked left instead or down my movement was bad like essentially when they fought right i walked
[5109.08s -> 5115.32s]  like this I should have walked like this because you want to cut off the Zaya from the gank now I
[5115.32s -> 5120.92s]  do think when Lulu just blindly ran away I think she kind of grieved you don't need to insta run
[5120.92s -> 5124.04s]  from ganks especially when like you could see what I have right I have Dirk and Sheen
[5125.56s -> 5129.88s]  something that a lot of people do as well is they will see that like the numbers are uneven
[5129.88s -> 5133.40s]  and they'll instantly run away they don't think about like how to win the fight or like what
[5133.40s -> 5137.16s]  the the win con is of the fight because that's what I was saying before we got ganked right
[5137.16s -> 5141.94s]  I was like fiddle can't gank us and he can't pre six fiddle does nothing in the gank. I had cleanse
[5142.92s -> 5148.72s]  They don't actually beat us in 3v2. So the problem was is we weren't focusing the same target
[5148.72s -> 5154.04s]  I went for the Zaya and she backed really far up now if we had played forward a bit
[5154.40s -> 5158.32s]  Like say she played a little more forward with me that would have gone a lot better or if I had played a little
[5158.32s -> 5162.76s]  More back with her. It was basically like we don't have comms. So the you know, it got rough
[5163.24s -> 5168.38s]  Now fiddle is six now, so it's a little scary
[5168.86s -> 5173.44s]  I don't like playing versus Fiddlesticks for like the reason of like 90% of the time
[5174.42s -> 5178.14s]  Players don't know how to ward around fiddle people put wards in weird spots
[5178.74s -> 5183.05s]  We should have won that fight though. I'm a little salty
[5183.69s -> 5194.56s]  Mainly myself. So this too Lulu keeps speeding me up
[5195.64s -> 5197.44s]  um, I
[5197.44s -> 5204.97s]  Want to be honest with you. I don't like when Lulu's do that. It's like a pet peeve thing of mine
[5204.97s -> 5206.89s]  When Lulu's use their speed
[5206.89s -> 5210.45s]  Okay, I'm okay with it if I need to dodge something or I need to chase somebody
[5210.73s -> 5214.49s]  But I think it's just so much less value than using it to CC early game
[5215.19s -> 5222.43s]  early game the CC of Lulu like using W is so broken to me because they they just physically can't move their character for
[5222.85s -> 5232.74s]  Like 1.5 seconds, which is crazy. I think Fiddles bot
[5234.32s -> 5242.46s]  You can kind of tell you see how they're playing really aggressive they don't beat us 2v2
[5242.46s -> 5245.82s]  So I'm thinking and they just cleared this ward out
[5246.66s -> 5251.10s]  I'm thinking fiddle is either on dragon or he's bush ganking bot somewhere
[5251.58s -> 5259.90s]  So I don't really want to walk up. You see how this guy is confidently hitting the turret
[5259.98s -> 5267.00s]  This is making me think Fiddle's trying to lane gank because they cannot beat us 2v2
[5267.40s -> 5274.70s]  Like I think Fiddle's in here. So I'm actually just gonna play safe
[5276.38s -> 5278.38s]  Until we see him on the map, I don't know
[5279.42s -> 5289.99s]  I'm not gonna take the chance
[5289.99s -> 5291.99s]  because
[5291.99s -> 5296.51s]  You got to think about like what you see and what you don't see on the map like we can't physically see fiddle
[5296.51s -> 5300.51s]  Right, but think about this. We don't see him top. That's something you have to think about
[5300.51s -> 5304.43s]  We we had a ward on riff just now for 15 15 seconds, right?
[5305.35s -> 5307.35s]  We didn't see him top
[5307.63s -> 5314.40s]  So like if he's not top, where is he now? I think he finally left
[5315.16s -> 5331.38s]  This looks like he went to dragon. Yeah, what are we doing by the way? I
[5331.38s -> 5336.42s]  I mean, I guess I'm just gonna die.
[5336.42s -> 5338.90s]  Now would be the time to speed me.
[5338.90s -> 5341.46s]  I mean, I don't even know what to say about that.
[5341.46s -> 5346.62s]  Malzahar just didn't walk.
[5346.62s -> 5349.06s]  Gragas didn't flash his E.
[5349.06s -> 5352.18s]  Malzahar didn't walk.
[5352.18s -> 5353.82s]  You always walk there, by the way.
[5353.82s -> 5355.48s]  I want to make this clear.
[5355.48s -> 5360.40s]  If you're a mid laner and you're playing a late game scaling mid, you always walk
[5360.40s -> 5362.10s]  to the fight no matter what though.
[5362.10s -> 5364.58s]  If it's at, if it's going, if it's doing that.
[5365.46s -> 5367.46s]  Okay guys
[5367.90s -> 5375.26s]  We need to walk to fights and Lulu you need to follow up when I go in don't run
[5375.74s -> 5383.21s]  I'm just gonna type it because I'm actually fucking annoying. I'm a little frustrated
[5383.21s -> 5389.81s]  I still think the game is 100% winnable, but I'm playing Draven. We're playing like I'm playing fucking Ezreal or some shit
[5390.57s -> 5396.29s]  And I can't walk up because essentially we know fiddle was bought for the last two three minutes, right? He just sat down there
[5404.59s -> 5407.45s]  What is my Lulu doing bro? What what are you doing?
[5410.64s -> 5412.64s]  No, we we fight this go
[5413.30s -> 5422.15s]  Yeah, this guy doesn't get to do this for free now. They have a gale force. So I need to be a little care
[5423.15s -> 5425.15s]  This guy has no ulti though
[5427.74s -> 5430.70s]  Like this is what I'm losing my minds, man
[5431.58s -> 5433.58s]  I do just
[5433.62s -> 5438.60s]  follow
[5438.60s -> 5442.26s]  No, what she was doing what she was trying to protect her ward
[5442.26s -> 5448.62s]  She saw the Rakan hitting the ward, but the Xayah walked up to get a free to just die.
[5448.62s -> 5452.22s]  The problem is my Lulu was like, oh, I don't want to give up my ward,
[5452.22s -> 5461.78s]  and she wasn't thinking. Please just sit with me, okay?
[5461.78s -> 5468.06s]  Yep, sorry. I need you to follow me, always.
[5468.06s -> 5474.46s]  Even if it looks scary, you gotta follow, okay?
[5474.46s -> 5489.97s]  Also, uh, one thing is there's actually not a lot of fighting that happens in lower elo.
[5489.97s -> 5495.01s]  So a lot of these players don't know how to fight early because one thing that I think
[5495.01s -> 5500.17s]  has gotten really bad about League lately, just in the past few years, is people don't
[5500.17s -> 5503.07s]  ever limit test in League ever anymore.
[5503.07s -> 5505.89s]  They always just play like pussies.
[5505.89s -> 5509.29s]  Every single player in League plays like a fucking pussy nowadays.
[5509.29s -> 5519.16s]  And it's literally just like sad to see.
[5519.16s -> 5522.48s]  Like right there, why aren't we W-ing?
[5522.48s -> 5530.79s]  Use W on the Xayah, not to speed.
[5530.79s -> 5535.91s]  Like I'm losing my mind because all you have to do there is W the Xayah, she gets CC'd,
[5535.91s -> 5538.31s]  we kill her on the W.
[5538.31s -> 5545.35s]  I'm telling you, Lulu players are like hardwired for some reason to not play correctly.
[5545.35s -> 5565.04s]  I'm never gonna catch this guy, he's got Galeforce and tier two boots.
[5570.55s -> 5574.19s]  Yeah, I mean I I have to go for it though because if I don't go for kills now the game's over
[5574.59s -> 5578.67s]  So it's either we go for it or we lose so I'm willing to like look stupid
[5581.98s -> 5585.90s]  Honestly, this game was my fault for the one to be three that happened early
[5585.90s -> 5589.32s]  I misplayed it and if I didn't miss play that we would have won the game off it
[5590.22s -> 5592.22s]  Now the game's pretty much over
[5593.02s -> 5595.24s]  Like it's solo queue so we can always come back
[5595.24s -> 5602.06s]  But the problem is I don't think we have good enough players to come back like look at what Lulu's doing Lulu
[5602.98s -> 5606.98s]  Why are you bot solo? At the moment. Think.
[5606.98s -> 5611.93s]  Like what? He's- AHHHHH!
[5611.93s -> 5613.93s]  What are we doing?
[5613.93s -> 5625.20s]  This is exactly what I was telling you guys. It doesn't make sense.
[5625.20s -> 5629.20s]  Remember when I told you support's easy? All you have to do is be a human.
[5629.20s -> 5633.20s]  Remember when I said that 40 sec- or 4 minutes ago before the game started?
[5633.20s -> 5640.02s]  All you have to do to play support is think, push buttons, and be active in the game.
[5640.02s -> 5643.02s]  And if you can do those things, you'll get challenger on support.
[5643.02s -> 5648.25s]  Like it blows my mind
[5648.57s -> 5650.65s]  Like what look what you do? What are you doing?
[5651.69s -> 5673.87s]  This is a there's a forfeit though. I'm gonna lose my minds
[5676.61s -> 5678.49s]  Auto-filled a D
[5678.49s -> 5695.64s]  I'm gonna lose it my bad guess. I'm an auto-filled a D. I'm just bad. It's on me. I apologize. Oh
[5704.42s -> 5706.42s]  Man, these players are crazy
[5706.46s -> 5712.01s]  I'm actually really surprised. We're just not forfeiting now
[5712.61s -> 5720.26s]  The best way to play the game is something that like I fall victim to to where I fuck this up sometimes, right?
[5720.26s -> 5726.26s]  But the best way to play the game a lot of the time is you essentially don't play to take risks.
[5728.26s -> 5737.64s]  I know it sounds silly, because you gotta find, essentially you have to find the, um...
[5737.64s -> 5742.64s]  My Malzahar just let this guy, this 1000 gold walk away.
[5742.64s -> 5755.78s]  Hey, Malz. If you move, by the way, you get 1k gold.
[5755.78s -> 5766.28s]  Mid isn't hard roll. I can mid in my sleep. It's not.
[5766.28s -> 5789.78s]  AD is easiest role. I'm AD carry streamer. I play AD but Lulu is small brain. That was
[5789.78s -> 5793.74s]  mean. Lulu took some some crossfire there that she didn't need to take. That was my
[5793.74s -> 5818.40s]  bad. That was toxic. I'll be real. I think today is going to be a mute all kind of
[5818.40s -> 5823.60s]  day. Listening to low elo players talk about the game and then they think that they're
[5823.60s -> 5827.12s]  right about the game and like how it works and all this shits. It actually like hurts
[5827.12s -> 5829.68s]  Like it shouldn't I should just laugh it off
[5829.68s -> 5835.52s]  But sometimes when I see a low elo player talk about how they think the game should be played and I just know that they're wrong
[5835.92s -> 5838.08s]  It actually like physically hurts me
[5841.91s -> 5843.91s]  It does it physically hurts
[5853.32s -> 5860.00s]  But I should follow my own rule where if you're playing with people that aren't as good like they don't see what you see
[5860.60s -> 5865.68s]  Right. There's like something where it's better to play safe and scale even on Draven
[5865.68s -> 5869.28s]  It's better to play safe in scale than to go for plays in lane
[5872.92s -> 5874.92s]  Mainly because
[5875.96s -> 5878.08s]  If you go for plays in lane
[5878.08s -> 5884.14s]  And let's say your support is not as good as you or your support's not confident in their ability to 2v2, right?
[5884.28s -> 5888.68s]  Then you're just gonna lose so you're like forcing that person to be in an uncomfortable situation
[5889.36s -> 5890.52s]  so
[5890.52s -> 5896.66s]  Like it's hard for me as a player to just play safe when I see the enemy making mistake after mistake
[5896.84s -> 5902.04s]  It's like something that I have trouble like personally working on right just like a personal issue
[5902.50s -> 5907.02s]  Where like I'll see an enemy make a mistake positional wise. I'm like, oh shit. Let's abuse this
[5907.30s -> 5909.40s]  but a lot of the time the problem that happens is
[5910.32s -> 5915.76s]  You have somebody who doesn't know that that person made a mistake or doesn't see the same mistake as me and because there's no
[5915.76s -> 5918.24s]  Combs I can't relate to them that we should fight right?
[5918.34s -> 5921.04s]  So if I go in and they don't know that we should be fighting there
[5921.04s -> 5928.46s]  I I end up dying and it looks it feels really bad, which is I mean
[5929.48s -> 5934.36s]  My fault. It's like a personal thing because you can't control your supports. You can only control yourself
[5934.96s -> 5937.50s]  It's just something that like I suck at doing sometimes
[5939.26s -> 5968.22s]  Right, so that's just on man we could actually kill desire and I by the way, she's like 60% HP
[5968.94s -> 5995.69s]  Like we could kill her. What is my Gragas doing? Oh
[5997.33s -> 6006.84s]  He got her though nice bro use W
[6008.28s -> 6010.28s]  Just you see people
[6011.08s -> 6018.24s]  Not to speed people
[6018.24s -> 6029.30s]  That was a good example, too. Oh, well, I just got to get better at doing that where I play safe though
[6029.30s -> 6032.42s]  That's on me. This is a personal thing. I got to get better at. Oh
[6060.02s -> 6063.38s]  Man, I think we're warmed up though. What 80 carry do you guys want to see next game?
[6063.38s -> 6071.54s]  game. That was that was a brutal ass game. I'm gonna be real. That was a brutal ass game.
[6071.54s -> 6077.38s]  What AD carry streamer you guys want to see or AD carry stream? What AD carry champion
[6077.38s -> 6084.68s]  do you guys want to see this game? I just goofed up and tried to play too aggressive
[6084.68s -> 6091.70s]  with a player that wasn't willing to play aggressive. That was on me. That's my bad.
[6091.70s -> 6111.33s]  I'll uh, I'll play better. This guy, this guy goes psi on.
[6118.16s -> 6121.52s]  Oh, never change Twitch chat, never change.
[6140.91s -> 6144.35s]  Well, the thing is, is you have, I have to change my mindset. So like the thing,
[6144.35s -> 6146.67s]  okay, let me explain something just like a personal thing with me.
[6147.47s -> 6151.39s]  I'm very, very, very good mechanically at this game, right? Like it's my best trade is like,
[6151.39s -> 6155.95s]  I have very good mechanics. So, and I also have like an autistic weird brain
[6155.95s -> 6163.47s]  where I can see I have really good pattern recognition so when I see that
[6163.47s -> 6167.67s]  the enemy is fucking up I know that I'm pretty much always gonna be better at
[6167.67s -> 6176.67s]  the 2v2 okay so because I know that I'm always gonna be better at the 2v2 I
[6176.67s -> 6181.61s]  always want to take the fight when I see that they make a mistake like they
[6181.61s -> 6186.45s]  miss a skill shot, or they walk up too far, stuff like that, right? But the
[6186.45s -> 6190.71s]  problem is, when you're bot lane, you have to work with a teammate. And that's
[6190.71s -> 6193.39s]  part of just playing AD carry, right? And if you're in solo queue, you can't
[6193.39s -> 6201.29s]  always duo. So you have to, I have to like train myself to just be okay with
[6201.29s -> 6206.27s]  them making mistakes and us not abusing those mistakes. It's very frustrating
[6206.27s -> 6208.85s]  for me personally, because I'm a perfectionist. So it's very
[6208.85s -> 6211.11s]  frustrating for me to like see this happening. And I'm like, Oh, I want to
[6211.11s -> 6215.55s]  abuse this because I know we can but we have to like I have to like tell myself
[6215.55s -> 6219.29s]  not to and just like not fuck up the wave state not take bad trades and shit
[6219.29s -> 6223.23s]  because every time there's there's more to it too so if like I walk up and I
[6223.23s -> 6226.01s]  take a fight right let's say like when Rakan W'd in when the fiddle
[6226.01s -> 6232.03s]  ganked for example right if I take that fight I'm now banking that fight
[6232.03s -> 6235.89s]  on Lulu also playing correctly right like they they missed all their
[6235.89s -> 6243.89s]  abilities and they fucked up but I also messed like you nobody can play perfectly every game
[6243.89s -> 6248.53s]  like I can't teammates can't nobody can it's league we're all humans right so you have to bank
[6248.53s -> 6252.29s]  when you're doing that on like your teammate being able to know what you want to accomplish
[6252.29s -> 6257.41s]  in that moment in solo queue with no comms and it's really hard like it's it's a really bad
[6257.41s -> 6265.25s]  mindset that I have sometimes but it's hard to get over because like I like the landing phase
[6265.25s -> 6271.79s]  for me is the most fun part of the game. I love landing face because in my opinion landing
[6271.79s -> 6276.45s]  face is like a little mini chess game between the enemy ball in right. It's like a it's
[6276.45s -> 6282.07s]  like a chess game with like mechanics where it's like how how well can like I auto space
[6282.07s -> 6287.17s]  them right can I can I space them well can I space them like can I by spacing I mean
[6287.17s -> 6291.47s]  can I walk into them trade and not take damage back right and I'm always thinking
[6291.47s -> 6295.35s]  to myself like okay can I do that I can and then I'm like I want to do this right
[6295.35s -> 6299.03s]  And then I'll like get somebody to half and then they'll panic and they'll engage on me
[6299.51s -> 6306.23s]  And the problem is though is like I said without comms or without like people who are recognizing what you're trying to accomplish
[6307.17s -> 6311.13s]  sometimes uh supports and in junglers people get flustered
[6311.83s -> 6317.51s]  And it will go badly and it's my fault at the end of the day because i'm choosing to that play style of relying on
[6317.59s -> 6323.67s]  My teammates instead of like knowing that I can probably outscale and play better late game and just like keep good cs
[6323.67s -> 6328.15s]  and not die on shit, which is what you guys should all do.
[6328.15s -> 6330.95s]  And that's what I tell people to do when they ask me how to play ID.
[6330.95s -> 6334.55s]  I tell you, don't die, scale up, get items.
[6334.55s -> 6340.45s]  But because I've played the game for so long and my favorite part of the game is lane
[6340.45s -> 6344.47s]  phase and winning lane and playing that little chess game, I fuck myself over in
[6344.47s -> 6350.63s]  a lot of games because I'll force fights that my teammate would have to play well
[6350.63s -> 6352.45s]  in as well to win.
[6352.45s -> 6357.93s]  I'll make a mistake or they'll make a mistake and we'll just lose the game off it and it's not a good play style
[6359.57s -> 6361.57s]  Right, it's not a good play style
[6362.21s -> 6368.53s]  That's just like something that like I know other people probably also have and I'm telling you that like if you want to
[6368.53s -> 6371.53s]  Climb you got to get out of that mindset and get into the mindset of like
[6372.97s -> 6382.47s]  Consistency because you can see last game for example. I just straight up like lost the game off of me
[6382.47s -> 6388.37s]  I'm trying to fight when my support didn't know how to fight or want to fight and we
[6388.37s -> 6395.37s]  lost the game off it like I was too aggro and even though if they did play correctly
[6395.37s -> 6401.37s]  we win they didn't so we lost so it's basically like it's just not like a good it's not
[6401.37s -> 6415.26s]  a good what's the word I'm looking for strategy because last game was my fault because
[6415.26s -> 6419.42s]  I'm good enough at the game that I know that I can't play like that if I want
[6419.42s -> 6427.82s]  to be consistent and I still play it like it so it's my bad all right what are we
[6427.82s -> 6433.04s]  playing this game boys we got Rengar Karma Jin what do people want to see
[6433.04s -> 6435.26s]  let me see if any of the ad carries people want to see if I can play these
[6435.26s -> 6440.78s]  I can't play Vayne into this the Vayne would be way too hard in the Karma Jin
[6440.78s -> 6453.72s]  I would just get zoned off the wave I could play a Phelios this is
[6453.72s -> 6461.84s]  actually a good a Phelios game you know what kind of sucks I feel kind of
[6461.84s -> 6467.52s]  bad playing Ophelios when I'm on my like teaching accounts, like this account to like teach you guys.
[6468.32s -> 6474.80s]  I feel bad playing Ophelios sometimes because I know a lot of people don't want to learn
[6474.80s -> 6481.60s]  Ophelios or play Ophelios because he is like really he's very unique.
[6483.12s -> 6487.76s]  Like he's he's hard to learn for a lot of people so I feel I always feel kind of bad
[6487.76s -> 6495.52s]  doing it right but i'll be real i don't know in this specific situation outside of like jinx
[6497.20s -> 6503.12s]  i didn't really know what else to pick like jinx is good kaisa is probably okay but you still get
[6503.12s -> 6518.05s]  zoned off the wave on kaisa because like if we if we look at this right uh kaisa would have
[6518.05s -> 6524.61s]  been i guess okay but when you're picking a champion for bot lane right when you're picking
[6524.61s -> 6527.95s]  When picking a champion for bot lane, one thing that you guys should think about when
[6527.95s -> 6531.61s]  picking like what champion you want to play, unless you're a one trick and then play whatever
[6531.61s -> 6535.15s]  you want, but if you're like somebody who wants to actually like play the meta and
[6535.15s -> 6542.64s]  learn why champions are meta and when to pick what, they picked Jhin Karma.
[6542.64s -> 6545.24s]  Now we have a Lulu.
[6545.24s -> 6550.52s]  If we had something with a hook, like a Nautilus, a Blitz, a Thresh, a Pyke,
[6550.52s -> 6554.76s]  like if we had something like that, I could pick a low range fighter, right?
[6554.76s -> 6558.30s]  Like I could pick a low range fighter if we had a hook champ.
[6558.30s -> 6562.62s]  But because we don't have a hook champ and we have an enchanter, I have to pick something
[6562.62s -> 6567.86s]  that can safely consistently farm and not get zoned off by their bot lane.
[6567.86s -> 6570.74s]  So there's not a lot of options that can do that.
[6570.74s -> 6574.56s]  There's like, I didn't want to pick, you could pick Ezreal here, it's not the worst,
[6574.56s -> 6578.18s]  but we had a Lulu, so I didn't want to pick Ezreal because Lulu goes to waste.
[6578.18s -> 6580.58s]  So it's like you could pick Jinx, but I kind of didn't want to pick Jinx this
[6580.58s -> 6583.46s]  game because Jinx bores the shit out of me right now.
[6583.46s -> 6587.62s]  So this would be a good Jinx game though, if you guys are curious, like this would be
[6587.62s -> 6589.44s]  a completely fine Jinx game.
[6589.44s -> 6595.98s]  Your E stops Rengar jump, you can follow up really easily with Lulu, like this would
[6595.98s -> 6600.34s]  be a good Jinx game.
[6600.34s -> 6602.38s]  But Aphelios, it's a good Aphelios game too, it's both.
[6602.38s -> 6605.34s]  It's got Aphelios game, good Jinx game.
[6605.34s -> 6607.38s]  It could be a good Zary game.
[6607.38s -> 6611.78s]  Zary wouldn't be that bad here with Lulu, and against their comp, they're all really
[6611.78s -> 6612.78s]  squishy.
[6612.78s -> 6615.58s]  She's really mobile can get away from like rengar ganks pretty easily
[6616.54s -> 6619.66s]  tristana, I okay, so trist is unique because
[6621.18s -> 6623.82s]  You only pick tristana if you plan on winning lane
[6624.46s -> 6625.82s]  Okay
[6625.82s -> 6630.22s]  Tristana doesn't actually scale better than jinx in any way
[6631.90s -> 6633.90s]  Like she does not have a better scaling than jinx
[6634.78s -> 6639.82s]  Trist trist versus jinx three items jinx wins every time in team fights. No matter what
[6639.82s -> 6642.82s]  Like you she just does what Trist does better
[6644.82s -> 6649.58s]  Now the reason you pick Trist is because you do want to win lane you want to like jump in you want to kill them
[6649.58s -> 6653.22s]  You want to be aggressive, right? So that's what you're picking Trist for is that I get kills in lane
[6653.78s -> 6659.22s]  The problem is is again what we were just talking about right? Let's say I pick Trist to get kills in lane now
[6659.22s -> 6661.22s]  Let's say my my
[6661.54s -> 6665.94s]  Support doesn't want to be aggressive and let's say like the Jhin and the Karma have a really good push
[6665.94s -> 6671.46s]  Okay, something that Trist is really weak at is being pushed in, right?
[6671.46s -> 6677.00s]  That's one of her weakest things because she has she struggles especially early game. She struggles quite a bit on farming under turret
[6677.82s -> 6679.82s]  so let's say
[6680.62s -> 6686.66s]  It's just like a coin flippy pick you could pick Trist if you had like a support duo for sure
[6687.26s -> 6691.38s]  Into into Jin Trist is amazing into Jin. It's one of Jen's hardest actual counters
[6691.38s -> 6698.38s]  But again, it's not about countering the champion, it's about countering the lane and what the lane is going to do to you and being able to play around that.
[6698.38s -> 6706.38s]  And this lane is a shove lane. Jhin, Karma doesn't fight you. They poke you and shove waves in. That's what they do. They're a prio lane.
[6706.38s -> 6708.38s]  So they're just going to shove and shove and shove, right?
[6708.38s -> 6716.38s]  So because they're just going to shove and shove and shove, I need to play something that isn't going to have issues playing under turret or something that can shove back if I need to.
[6716.38s -> 6723.80s]  Right? Which is why Jinx, Aphelios are both good.
[6723.80s -> 6726.60s]  Ezreal again would just get shoved in stuff like that, right?
[6726.60s -> 6730.20s]  Yeah, these are things you actually have to think about when you're playing the game for certain
[6731.00s -> 6732.20s]  champions
[6732.20s -> 6734.84s]  and certain matchups because a lot of the time
[6735.44s -> 6740.12s]  People will pick a champion that's meta and they won't understand why they're still losing the matchup
[6740.12s -> 6743.96s]  Even though they're good at that champion and it's just that you're not bad at the champ
[6744.12s -> 6747.34s]  The matchup is just unplayable. You could put faker
[6747.34s -> 6753.20s]  Doublelift, fucking Gumiase in certain matchups and they will just lose. They will lose the matchups
[6753.20s -> 6755.86s]  And it's because no matter how good your mechanics are
[6756.40s -> 6763.88s]  If the matchup is played correctly, it doesn't it's not winnable. And that's why you see in pro play drafting is so important
[6763.88s -> 6767.48s]  It's perfect example of why in pro play drafting is ten times more important than solo queue
[6767.48s -> 6774.69s]  And it's because when everybody plays the matchups correctly and shit, right? When everybody's playing the matchups correctly and shits
[6775.81s -> 6779.29s]  The matchup like skill becomes a thousand times more important
[6780.09s -> 6786.81s]  Or like, you know how the matchups being played like the champions become way more important. Whoa, what the fuck?
[6787.89s -> 6790.13s]  My monitor just fucked up. What the hell is going on?
[6794.57s -> 6798.69s]  another little tip for you guys who I fucked that but another little tip for you guys is
[6801.49s -> 6804.51s]  melee champions or melee minions take
[6810.76s -> 6817.73s]  one turret shot two autos or sorry two turrets shots one auto and casters take one auto one turret shot
[6819.37s -> 6821.87s]  When you're under turrets like luck, okay, so
[6823.17s -> 6826.73s]  Learning this will be actually a pretty game to explain to you how to farm under the turn actually
[6826.73s -> 6830.85s]  I was thinking about like what I could teach you guys because we're just gonna get shoved in a lot this game
[6832.45s -> 6840.12s]  It's actually not that bad though
[6840.12s -> 6842.68s]  So right now we could actually space forward here
[6843.92s -> 6859.37s]  Okay, that did not hit me that was BS. But sure I did the same thing. I did last game man. I
[6860.69s -> 6862.85s]  Did the same thing you said I walked up
[6863.93s -> 6866.79s]  It wasn't it was a good fight. But again
[6867.61s -> 6872.17s]  Keep doing that or like I see the fight and I'll take the fight because I know it's a good fight
[6873.01s -> 6879.04s]  But Lulu was too far back. So I ended up just inting. It's really stupid
[6879.60s -> 6899.36s]  like it was such a dumb play by me because I had to blow both my sums right there because
[6900.96s -> 6905.22s]  The gin or I mean the gin was in a really bad spot and the karma was in really bad spot because I was
[6905.22s -> 6908.00s]  Level three and they were level two and they were walking up to contest waves
[6908.84s -> 6909.88s]  but
[6909.88s -> 6913.12s]  My Lulu was behind me and when you're playing, you know
[6913.12s -> 6918.68s]  solo queue you have to play as a team with your teammate okay so this Jin is
[6918.68s -> 6928.20s]  kind of griefing right now he's griefing by like walking up when I'm
[6928.20s -> 6936.84s]  blue gunning him I don't know what Lulu is doing I'm just killing that guy nice
[6936.84s -> 6940.36s]  yeah they're they're grieving really hard so the blue guns OP for what you
[6940.36s -> 6943.60s]  just saw all you have to do with the blue gun if you really want to
[6943.60s -> 6948.38s]  just like have a funny ass overpowered fucking when they're farming under the
[6948.38s -> 6966.96s]  turret like that just hit the minions okay we're getting ganked back up so I
[6966.96s -> 6972.18s]  kind of did a cardinal sin there I would say like a sin of like I overstayed
[6972.18s -> 6980.24s]  a bit I think oh okay well fuck off dude that was greedy I should have
[6980.24s -> 6982.34s]  backed out the turret but I didn't think Karma was actually gonna do that
[6982.34s -> 6985.34s]  but I did overstay because you can see like this is the perfect example
[6985.34s -> 6990.22s]  of why I overstayed so they stopped my back right I can give you guys a really
[6990.22s -> 6995.22s]  good example of what just happens I overstayed and when I overstayed I
[6995.22s -> 6998.54s]  didn't actually get anything out of it like I got what you saw I just have
[6998.54s -> 7002.50s]  extra gold for nothing so now I just have extra gold right and because I
[7002.50s -> 7005.86s]  have extra gold the gin actually gets a net positive because they stopped my
[7005.86s -> 7009.58s]  back so he gets a free plate here I miss a cannon and even though I'm
[7009.58s -> 7014.46s]  still up 10 CS it's like I could have been up 10 CS not given a plate
[7014.46s -> 7023.78s]  and not missed a cannon. So it's it's basically like it's interesting. Should you get prio for your
[7023.78s -> 7032.76s]  jungler every game? No. No, that's not important. Some games, prio is important. It's very important
[7032.76s -> 7037.24s]  some games, but you don't need to always be thinking about getting prio for your jungler.
[7037.80s -> 7040.68s]  That's not something you should be like thinking about like always, right? Like you
[7040.68s -> 7045.32s]  you think about it in terms of like timers. That's important, but prio for jungler always
[7045.32s -> 7056.18s]  is not like something you should be worrying about because if you're perma shoving and you're
[7056.18s -> 7060.66s]  like oh i have prio for my jungler but then your jungler doesn't do anything like having that
[7060.66s -> 7067.27s]  prio if you don't have pride it doesn't do anything like i'd rather hold the wave in like
[7067.27s -> 7105.78s]  a certain spot oh my god i suck i mean it worked out i think if i was six i triple killed
[7105.78s -> 7112.62s]  them there but I think we actually almost I think we actually triple kill
[7112.62s -> 7116.34s]  them too if Lulu helps me but again you guys know what I'm gonna say I go back
[7116.34s -> 7167.25s]  to the thing I don't know if Rengar has ulti or not I want to shove this
[7167.25s -> 7185.49s]  because chill I want to shove it in for seconds and I really don't have
[7185.49s -> 7189.25s]  anything to do so I'll just stand here you want to also be back backed
[7189.25s -> 7193.21s]  once it's hit for when they buy boots I bought boots Aphelios you can
[7193.21s -> 7198.49s]  boots really early he's like he's a champion where the more attacks you do is actually very
[7198.49s -> 7203.85s]  valuable and positioning on aphelios is very important it's kind of like um some ad carries
[7203.85s -> 7207.77s]  like you don't need boots really early like like with like jinx for example i usually go
[7207.77s -> 7215.93s]  free boots right or i go boots like after my kraken but with aphelios uh i really like the
[7215.93s -> 7226.73s]  early mobility the early trading stuff like that's okay so always be watching the map too
[7226.73s -> 7228.73s]  We see that Rengar's top, right?
[7228.73s -> 7231.05s]  We can actually just straight fight these guys 2v2 right now.
[7232.17s -> 7238.10s]  Uh, what?
[7238.26s -> 7241.19s]  Wait, what?
[7241.19s -> 7243.19s]  What's my Lulu doing, homie?
[7243.67s -> 7245.83s]  What what are we he's ulting us?
[7257.05s -> 7258.97s]  So you're saying
[7258.97s -> 7271.50s]  Helping the ad carry is bad. Got it. I can't believe my Lulu just walked away from me
[7272.62s -> 7275.82s]  And just like watched like you work as a team
[7275.82s -> 7283.49s]  This is something that I cannot stress enough play as a team
[7284.63s -> 7286.63s]  When you play League of Legends
[7286.75s -> 7290.03s]  This tilts me more than anything because this happens even in Grandmaster
[7290.15s -> 7294.47s]  I see teammates who will be selfish and not help each other
[7295.31s -> 7297.31s]  Just help each other
[7297.87s -> 7300.91s]  Help each other. Please man. We are a team
[7303.63s -> 7306.71s]  Don't just run and leave your ADC
[7306.71s -> 7313.81s]  Like, I'm not even flaming you, but like, dude, you can't do that.
[7313.81s -> 7319.25s]  You can't be upset that, like, I can't dodge every spell, right?
[7319.25s -> 7323.89s]  I feel like something that I notice that happens a lot in League now is players will
[7323.89s -> 7331.29s]  have this weirdly high expectation for everyone to play absolutely perfect at all times.
[7331.29s -> 7334.01s]  And they want me to, like, beat Gumiase.
[7334.01s -> 7337.37s]  And I'm like, dude, I dodged two of the Jhin bullets.
[7337.37s -> 7343.21s]  I dodged a Karma Q, like you literally, like I can't dodge literally everything while slowed,
[7343.21s -> 7344.21s]  right?
[7344.21s -> 7352.86s]  Like that's not how it works.
[7352.86s -> 7385.39s]  Like, dude, I'm going to lose my mind with this guy.
[7385.39s -> 7392.41s]  My Lulu is blaming me.
[7392.41s -> 7395.44s]  It's okay.
[7395.44s -> 7396.44s]  It's okay.
[7396.44s -> 7398.86s]  I don't need to be upset.
[7398.86s -> 7400.48s]  It's fine.
[7400.48s -> 7409.06s]  The Lulu player is totally okay.
[7409.06s -> 7412.50s]  You know, sometimes people think they're right.
[7412.50s -> 7424.73s]  It's just what happens in the worlds.
[7424.73s -> 7427.81s]  It's just, it is what it is.
[7427.81s -> 7428.81s]  No big deal.
[7428.81s -> 7445.94s]  Sorry, I'm trying really hard to not be an asshole right now.
[7445.94s -> 7450.46s]  This Lulu player is making me like, making me one of like fun Thanos.
[7450.46s -> 7451.46s]  You know what I mean?
[7451.46s -> 7457.80s]  Like this guy is like making me, like this guy, like we talk about, like in League,
[7457.80s -> 7464.44s]  talk about like the players, like we talk about ad carry players having ego, I genuinely think
[7465.48s -> 7471.40s]  support players have five times the ego ad carry players have, but with like a third of the skill.
[7475.36s -> 7483.40s]  I think ad carry players do have massive egos, but again I don't think that like, I think
[7483.40s -> 7488.44s]  support players are genuinely the dumbest motherfucking humans on the planet, and they
[7488.44s -> 7492.72s]  They think that they're the best players to ever touch the game and it hurts my fucking
[7492.72s -> 7515.00s]  balls.
[7515.00s -> 7527.28s]  Hey Lulu, would you be willing to have a VOD review with me in Discord after the game?
[7527.28s -> 7528.28s]  Let's just see.
[7528.28s -> 7532.36s]  I want to see if like this person is willing to listen to reason.
[7532.36s -> 7557.15s]  Let's see.
[7557.15s -> 7562.39s]  I'm trying to not tilt, but it's really frustrating because this player is playing
[7562.39s -> 7568.31s]  specifically for KDA and they're playing like they don't understand how like I
[7568.31s -> 7572.71s]  can already tell you if I go look at this person's op.gg they only play for
[7572.71s -> 7577.95s]  KDA I can tell you right now right here this person plays only for KDA
[7577.95s -> 7582.35s]  never takes any risks doesn't ever help their AD carry ever when they get
[7582.35s -> 7586.47s]  behind doesn't ever walk up to like try and fight doesn't do any of that I
[7586.47s -> 7589.59s]  can tell you right now without even looking at their op.gg from how this
[7589.59s -> 7599.04s]  person plays that they have high KDAs but really low win rate but I don't want
[7599.04s -> 7601.68s]  my entire stream to be bitching about this Lulu so we'll try and focus on how
[7601.68s -> 7605.92s]  to win from this position so I'm sure you guys get shitty supports too so
[7605.92s -> 7620.57s]  we'll try and focus on how to win from the current position we're in yeah it
[7620.57s -> 7623.87s]  doesn't get better I mean I'll be honest with you my grandmaster
[7623.87s -> 7628.31s]  supports on my main suck like it doesn't get better they get better like
[7628.31s -> 7632.51s]  mechanically at the game right like the higher elo supports get better
[7632.51s -> 7638.91s]  mechanically but they get worse they don't get better when like it doesn't get better it's always
[7638.91s -> 7650.17s]  like you'll either have a really good support or you have somebody who sniffs glue i'm just dead
[7653.39s -> 7680.94s]  or i'm not dead okay uh honestly our biggest issue here is i need to get bloodthirster asap
[7681.58s -> 7693.72s]  once i get bt the game gets a lot easier we could kill this guy right now
[7694.76s -> 7697.16s]  if the lulu helps me we can actually just straight kill these guys
[7698.04s -> 7703.34s]  Because I can ulti to heal myself right we have Lulu ult I have ult to heal myself and I'm strong
[7704.44s -> 7707.64s]  She has ignite. I have ult. I have everything right we could easily
[7709.52s -> 7711.64s]  Kill that that Taliyah right there. I
[7713.44s -> 7715.44s]  Mean yeah, whatever man
[7715.52s -> 7717.52s]  This is what I'm talking about
[7721.24s -> 7722.68s]  again
[7722.68s -> 7726.92s]  Are you willing to get into discord and vod review?
[7726.92s -> 7742.88s]  Yes or no? I mean, I have to be honest with you. The reason this is frustrating is because
[7742.88s -> 7748.60s]  as an ADC player, you want to be able to rely on your support, right? You want to be able
[7748.60s -> 7753.56s]  to make plays, go in, fight and rely on your teammates because as an ADC player,
[7753.56s -> 7758.64s]  support and AD are like a duo, right? Like you want to play together. No, no man.
[7758.64s -> 7760.64s]  I'm not attacking you.
[7760.64s -> 7764.64s]  I'm saying let's discord after.
[7764.64s -> 7775.90s]  You can explain your POV and I'll explain mine.
[7775.90s -> 7778.86s]  Maybe we can like improve this player.
[7778.86s -> 7784.34s]  Like get them to be a better player and not ruin every game they play in.
[7784.34s -> 7791.20s]  Like that would be that would be the goat.
[7791.20s -> 7803.96s]  Like the app that did not hit me by the way that hitbox was BS but.
[7803.96s -> 7810.08s]  I don't even understand.
[7810.08s -> 7817.12s]  Oh man.
[7817.12s -> 7825.17s]  This is the person's, by the way, this is the person's OP.GG.
[7825.17s -> 7832.21s]  Average win rate, 50% win rate like I said, has really good KDAs on all his champs, but
[7832.21s -> 7835.03s]  he doesn't win.
[7835.03s -> 7840.55s]  I'm telling you right now, the biggest thing in League, the FAKEST thing in League of
[7840.55s -> 7846.53s]  Legends is believing that you are a good player based on KDA.
[7846.53s -> 7854.63s]  If I go look at any challenger level support player right now, their KDAs will be like 4.
[7854.63s -> 7857.45s]  They'll still have good KDA, but it'll be like 4 and 3.
[7857.45s -> 7861.43s]  And it'll be on... that's your mutual?
[7861.43s -> 7867.43s]  I'm gonna be real with you right now, T. This Lulu player, like, you could tell me
[7867.43s -> 7872.23s]  that this person sniffed glue as a kid and their parents never told them to stop.
[7872.23s -> 7874.07s]  And I would believe you.
[7874.07s -> 7875.07s]  I'm not even memeing.
[7875.07s -> 7880.43s]  say that makes sense. I mean, like I said, I don't even care. I don't care if it's a girl or a guy.
[7880.99s -> 7884.99s]  The E-girl thing is like that doesn't bother me, right? Like it could be a girl, a guy, a pigeon.
[7884.99s -> 7891.87s]  They could they could fucking they could relate as a fucking peanut in a in a fucking plane. I
[7891.87s -> 7898.05s]  don't care about that at all. You know what I mean? Like that shit doesn't bother me at all.
[7899.41s -> 7903.17s]  Like them, like I actually think it's stupid when people are like, oh, it's an E-girl,
[7903.17s -> 7907.69s]  You got like I I think that's dumb as shit because that arguments so crap
[7908.21s -> 7910.21s]  Because like I don't give a shit if it's a guy or girl
[7910.45s -> 7915.05s]  Because like you know what I mean, I'm more upset at the fact that this person is delusional than anything
[7915.89s -> 7929.98s]  That's like what's tilting me here. I'm just gonna mute
[7930.58s -> 7935.46s]  We'll do one more game on this account after this game and I'm gonna mute from the start of the game for you guys
[7935.46s -> 7942.34s]  Okay
[7942.34s -> 7945.26s]  Dude, if he didn't actually get me into the wall there
[7945.26s -> 7949.52s]  I tried to walk forward so that I wouldn't get condemned in the wall if he didn't stun me I kill him
[7950.36s -> 7952.36s]  That's annoying
[7952.64s -> 7972.23s]  That was actually such a good hitbox for him my bad nice huge shutdown nice job
[7972.61s -> 7975.69s]  If you're wondering why I'm even here, by the way, I'm actually I'm not trolling
[7975.89s -> 7981.47s]  I'm trying to get this turret because this gives me a lot of gold at the moment. I'm not actually worth that much gold
[7981.75s -> 7984.75s]  There's nothing going on on the map. There's no objective or anything like that, right?
[7984.87s -> 7987.81s]  So I'm trying to push in top waves right now so that I can get gold
[7989.27s -> 7992.47s]  To try and like hyper inflate my two item before this next dragon
[7993.03s -> 7997.19s]  Because this next dragon is gonna be incredibly important if we if we want any chance to win
[7998.05s -> 8000.05s]  we have to win that this next dragon and
[8000.51s -> 8003.95s]  the only way for me to do that is to either get really lucky or
[8005.23s -> 8007.23s]  Go get some gold in a sideline
[8007.59s -> 8010.15s]  It's just support difference every game it is
[8010.15s -> 8015.33s]  I want to point this out this person is playing this victim complex bullshit
[8015.59s -> 8018.35s]  Like you know what I mean, but it is it is actually support death
[8018.99s -> 8057.23s]  Sorry, I'm tilted I'm playing bad this game I
[8058.67s -> 8061.67s]  Need to mute these players because these players are actually tilting me
[8063.07s -> 8066.83s]  Like I was fine with it before but I'm actually getting a little irritated that's making me play bad
[8067.67s -> 8069.95s]  So I need to mute them so I don't keep inting
[8070.71s -> 8074.73s]  Like it's affecting my gameplay and it's pissing me off
[8075.45s -> 8078.45s]  That's just my bad
[8078.45s -> 8087.71s]  T split. Are you here T?
[8088.55s -> 8090.83s]  Yo T message this Lulu. I
[8091.51s -> 8094.67s]  Mean this in the nicest way. I don't even want to be toxic
[8095.07s -> 8097.49s]  I genuinely want to use this for content
[8100.83s -> 8102.83s]  Like this guy's been flaming me the whole game
[8103.15s -> 8109.11s]  Like I want to use this for content to show you guys that it is so easy to tell people how the game should be
[8109.11s -> 8109.95s]  played
[8109.95s -> 8113.23s]  So easy if you if you can communicate by talking
[8116.73s -> 8120.41s]  Because this guy's been doing nothing but flaming me the entire game this Lulu right?
[8120.53s -> 8127.49s]  But he's an absolute like he played the lane completely bad. Then he gave then he stopped trying to win
[8128.25s -> 8131.35s]  Stop shielding me. Stop doing anything right after he played the lane back
[8133.59s -> 8138.09s]  Then he started playing the victim thing when I asked him to be a human and like come over and like help me and play
[8138.09s -> 8141.49s]  Teamwork you gotta remember. I didn't flame him a single time, right?
[8141.49s -> 8144.65s]  Like I didn't say a single negative thing to this guy in game. I said let's work as a team
[8145.25s -> 8150.47s]  He got upset
[8150.47s -> 8154.11s]  like I genuinely think it'd be great content if I could talk to this guy in discord and
[8154.63s -> 8156.81s]  Just like oh, I'd be so good
[8173.60s -> 8176.88s]  Right, dude. I'm I'm trying to kill these people guys
[8177.68s -> 8181.18s]  That wasn't bad though. We got 800 gold
[8181.70s -> 8184.32s]  Not the worst, but I don't know if my team can stall this
[8185.10s -> 8187.34s]  maybe if they can like kill this they can stall it but
[8191.56s -> 8195.92s]  Nah, they're yeah, that's that's GG. That was disgusting tallia W
[8196.76s -> 8242.43s]  Alright, I'm gonna add him and he'll probably not add me but I might as well try this would be such a good learning experience
[8242.67s -> 8252.27s]  Oh
[8252.27s -> 8256.59s]  Excuse me, dude. I've had like bad heartburn today. I need to take one of those heartburn pills
[8256.59s -> 8275.48s]  What Lulu? What man? Just say it, just let it out. Let it out. Let it out baby. Yo. Lulu.
[8275.48s -> 8297.39s]  Let's just have a talk. Yo. Let's discord. We can bother via. Since I'm so bad. Yo.
[8297.39s -> 8315.24s]  Trust. You just blamed everyone but yourself, but you didn't play correctly at all. You
[8316.12s -> 8325.18s]  played lane completely wrong, didn't help each other, left people to die on repeats,
[8327.02s -> 8341.29s]  then played victim. I genuinely want to help you.
[8341.29s -> 8374.26s]  This guy screenshotted what I just said and put it in the end game chat.
[8374.26s -> 8388.10s]  What is happening right now? What is going on?
[8388.10s -> 8399.42s]  There is no way that this is not an NPC.
[8399.42s -> 8404.42s]  There is no way this is not an NPC.
[8404.42s -> 8422.44s]  there's no way there's no way it's geronimo lamau it is me yes bro just come talk in discord i'm
[8422.44s -> 8437.19s]  not even gonna flame you what does this even mean bro i don't think i've seen anybody more
[8437.19s -> 8451.99s]  insecure in my life bro you are so insecure it's cringe how insecure you are like oof
[8453.67s -> 8457.83s]  good luck man on the climb to masters but
[8459.51s -> 8472.20s]  jesus christ that's sad oh god i dude i don't even know what to say like i'm gonna be real
[8472.20s -> 8477.08s]  I wasn't like I'm not even gonna flame the guy right. I just genuinely want to like
[8477.80s -> 8479.80s]  improve the community
[8480.80s -> 8485.08s]  Because that was three straight supports in a row they didn't know how to play Lulu and
[8485.76s -> 8489.96s]  I'd not even gonna flame the guy's skill. He's not a Lulu player, right? He doesn't play Lulu
[8489.96s -> 8495.20s]  That's fine. But the issue was that I had with that guy specifically was that
[8495.68s -> 8497.68s]  It's okay to be bad at the game
[8497.96s -> 8501.60s]  Right. There's nothing wrong with being bad at League. Everybody has bad games
[8501.60s -> 8507.70s]  But when we're playing a game together, and you're saying it's winnable and you want to win the game, you can't pick and choose
[8508.68s -> 8510.68s]  Who to like help win the game?
[8511.64s -> 8513.64s]  Like if I'm sitting there bot lane
[8513.64s -> 8519.14s]  We're both being dove by Jhin and you're intentionally trying not to take damage and not die
[8519.60s -> 8523.20s]  Because you want to value your KDA over everything else
[8523.80s -> 8527.08s]  So that I you know what hold on let me think about this. I
[8528.44s -> 8530.44s]  Think I figured this person out
[8531.60s -> 8536.56s]  This person lives in delusion and I think I figured this out. Let me let me explain this a lot of players do this
[8536.56s -> 8539.12s]  But I think I'm figuring this out as I'm as I'm thinking about this
[8540.16s -> 8542.16s]  so
[8542.16s -> 8548.32s]  This person has really good kda's on their profile, right? This like this eye-catching person. They've really really good kda's on the profile,right?
[8549.36s -> 8553.44s]  This person doesn't ever take risks doesn't ever do anything
[8554.16s -> 8557.84s]  To try and win the game outside of like just existing and hitting buttons
[8557.84s -> 8567.70s]  And what they do is they will always have good KDAs and they will they will sit here and never like I know why they're losing
[8568.18s -> 8573.26s]  They will sit here and they will do this shit where they have good KDAs. They they don't ever die that much blah blah blah
[8573.82s -> 8578.54s]  But what they do is they lie to themselves and they say look how good my KDAs are
[8579.06s -> 8585.46s]  If I had better teammates, I'd always win like I
[8586.22s -> 8588.22s]  Cracked the code actually
[8588.22s -> 8596.52s]  That's totally what it is. The players actually like play so safe and they play to like for statistics, right?
[8596.52s -> 8606.02s]  They play like purely for the stats and then they can say that it was their team's fault that they didn't win because they played really bad.
[8606.02s -> 8617.90s]  But they didn't die because I mean in theory I could have a perfect KDA on every 80 carry I play, right?
[8617.90s -> 8623.62s]  All I'd have to do is literally walk walk up get one kill and then afk and stand in the base the rest of the game
[8623.62s -> 8628.10s]  And I could be like yo, why's my team not able to carry what's happening?
[8631.13s -> 8636.45s]  Right, but you could literally do that. No, I seriously think the person's self gas lighting himself
[8637.65s -> 8643.21s]  Like I'm serious. I think this person's like self gas lighting where they they're like, oh, it's my team's fault every game
[8643.45s -> 8649.37s]  right like they're always blaming their team for their their their loses in their mistakes and shits and it's sad because like
[8649.37s -> 8653.13s]  Like there's a reason you're D2 and I'm not saying that to be toxic.
[8653.13s -> 8656.77s]  I'm saying that like you haven't improved in four years and you haven't improved because
[8656.77s -> 8659.89s]  all you're doing is playing to blame your team every single game.
[8659.89s -> 8663.69s]  When I just saw like 500 mistakes that you made that we could have won the game
[8663.69s -> 8671.82s]  off of early game here.
[8671.82s -> 8675.06s]  I remember somebody wanted me to play a Caitlin game last game.
[8675.06s -> 8677.78s]  So we're gonna play Kate.
[8677.78s -> 8678.78s]  I don't remember.
[8678.78s -> 8679.78s]  I don't remember who it was in the chat.
[8679.78s -> 8684.14s]  Somebody like two people said Kate, but we'll do a cake game for you guys.
[8684.14s -> 8703.91s]  I got you boys don't worry. All right, I'm gonna take
[8704.67s -> 8710.39s]  Ghost flash because they have three melee champs four melee champs. They have they have Rakan Zed, Kled, Gragas
[8710.39s -> 8712.39s]  So I'm gonna take ghost flash
[8712.99s -> 8714.79s]  These are gonna be my runes this game
[8714.79s -> 8718.11s]  I'm gonna take a little more MR because I don't think we're gonna be fighting too much in lane
[8718.31s -> 8721.45s]  We're pretty much just gonna be poking them with Karma Kate
[8722.11s -> 8726.01s]  So I'm gonna take a little bit extra MR cuz I'm gonna be playing for mid delay game. I'm just scaling
[8726.01s -> 8739.25s]  And these are going to be the runes that I take, even classes on adc or the easier to
[8739.25s -> 8740.25s]  play ones.
[8740.25s -> 8744.45s]  In adc, I usually do like when I'm playing on this account right now, this is like my
[8744.45s -> 8746.45s]  teaching account.
[8746.45s -> 8749.33s]  It's a little lower MMR, right, it's like D1 low masters.
[8749.33s -> 8755.21s]  I usually play adc that like the chat wants to see me play so that you guys can learn
[8755.21s -> 8759.03s]  like good and bad matchups and things like that.
[8759.03s -> 8763.71s]  The last two games, I got way too tilted by shitty support players.
[8763.71s -> 8764.87s]  Like egos and all that shit.
[8764.87s -> 8767.67s]  I got way too frustrated and I played bad the last two games.
[8767.67s -> 8768.67s]  So we're gonna...
[8768.67s -> 8771.47s]  Honestly, I'm just gonna, I think I'm just gonna mute these people at the very start
[8771.47s -> 8772.47s]  of the game.
[8772.47s -> 8776.95s]  Normally, I wouldn't suggest you mute people because like playing as a team is really
[8776.95s -> 8777.95s]  important.
[8777.95s -> 8781.55s]  Because like, you know, you need to communicate and all that shit, but I am just like,
[8781.55s -> 8784.23s]  I'm gonna mute them.
[8784.23s -> 8785.79s]  I
[8785.79s -> 8789.87s]  Dude, my mental is taking a fucking hit right now. So we're gonna just chill and play. I
[8793.57s -> 8798.57s]  Just don't know how to play Naila. I think that was really good. I just don't I don't know how to play her. I
[8799.97s -> 8806.46s]  Think she's a great champ like I've been getting shit on by Naila on my main account
[8807.78s -> 8822.58s]  Like a lot of grandmaster Naila's have been dumpstering me. I think she's just really good at abusing solo queue
[8823.54s -> 8825.54s]  like the the issue with Naila is
[8825.90s -> 8828.32s]  From what I've seen all the losses I've had with Naila
[8828.98s -> 8840.98s]  People don't, it's like the thing I was telling you about before, people don't play aggressively in the lower elos, like even in Grandmaster people don't play like aggressively enough, it sounds crazy to say that, but it's true.
[8840.98s -> 8851.98s]  They don't play aggressively enough in lane, so you can get away with just picking Nyla and scaling. And Nyla at like one item, you'll always be up in levels right, because that's how the champion works.
[8851.98s -> 8860.70s]  The champion works in like you'll always be up in levels because of her passive. So you basically just like scale through existing
[8861.02s -> 8863.02s]  It's pretty it's pretty interesting
[8864.10s -> 8870.27s]  All right, so we're playing Kate Karma. Oh, I missed the minion because I suck
[8871.35s -> 8873.35s]  I'm gonna ward this bush
[8874.47s -> 8876.47s]  Just because I don't want the recon in the bush
[8877.03s -> 8885.68s]  So now that the bush isn't warded anymore
[8886.32s -> 8889.76s]  Okay, warded it nice. I was gonna say what I want to do is I actually want to play
[8889.76s -> 8895.66s]  Oh, I suck. I actually wanted to play. Oh man. I'm so bad at Kate
[8895.66s -> 8900.42s]  I wanted to play on the top side of the wave so that I'm not standing near the bushes, right?
[8900.94s -> 8902.94s]  Because if you stand near the bushes
[8903.74s -> 8908.22s]  The Rakan can obviously like W me and I just get fucked so I'd rather play in a safer spot
[8909.46s -> 8911.46s]  Can't believe I missed two CS. I'm so fucking bad
[8912.34s -> 8916.60s]  Now I want to push in wave three and I want to go buy a cull. So I'm gonna ping to push
[8925.34s -> 8926.98s]  Okay
[8926.98s -> 8931.78s]  So I actually want to back here and I'm gonna go buy a call. So this is called a cheater recall
[8933.26s -> 8937.08s]  You usually have perfect CS to back on this timer
[8937.80s -> 8939.80s]  Go and you can go by a call. Okay
[8940.30s -> 8944.30s]  This is like something that you can do if you're in a lane that's gonna be perma shoving
[8944.44s -> 8950.56s]  So what happens is the reason it's called the cheater recall is because we push the wave in they had to stay and
[8950.56s -> 8952.98s]  Farm the wave right now watch
[8952.98s -> 8961.03s]  They have to push this wave in right now if karma was here instead of roaming this room is fine
[8961.03s -> 8964.03s]  By the way, but if she was here instead of roaming she could actually hold the wave
[8965.19s -> 8976.11s]  And if you notice here, I don't actually miss that many minions, right? We're chilling now. We can slow push this
[8976.23s -> 8978.93s]  We're safe. I should actually fast push this
[8979.83s -> 8983.23s]  Because I wanted to bounce. I don't want to slow push this but I can't I
[8984.15s -> 8987.67s]  Can't fast push this at level three by myself
[8987.67s -> 8993.67s]  So we're just gonna chill
[8994.71s -> 8997.71s]  Caitlin's really good at abusing like early lane phase
[8998.19s -> 9003.51s]  Bullying just based on like what our kit does we see we're con on the map top side. You get you see that's
[9004.49s -> 9011.17s]  So because we see we're con I can walk up a bit and we could play a little aggro here
[9011.53s -> 9022.48s]  You can kind of see like I don't have to play behind the minion wave. You see what I'm doing to this guy, right? I
[9023.48s -> 9033.75s]  Hate this game. We can quit we can forfeit. It's fine. I hate this game. I hate I really hate
[9033.77s -> 9034.77s]  this game.
[9034.77s -> 9036.41s]  Dude, what is wrong with me right now?
[9036.41s -> 9038.21s]  It's like my brain doesn't work.
[9038.21s -> 9047.70s]  It's the 280k nerf, I'm telling you.
[9047.70s -> 9051.02s]  So Rakan's gonna be bot right now.
[9051.02s -> 9052.02s]  I know he's gonna be bot.
[9052.02s -> 9055.22s]  So I need to be a little care.
[9055.22s -> 9059.47s]  Now my Karma is here.
[9059.47s -> 9060.47s]  There we go.
[9060.47s -> 9061.47s]  So you notice I didn't use any spells.
[9061.47s -> 9066.06s]  I'm not, I'm just chilling.
[9066.06s -> 9067.38s]  Dude.
[9067.38s -> 9071.08s]  Are you kidding me, man?
[9071.08s -> 9072.22s]  I'm gonna be honest.
[9072.22s -> 9075.24s]  I'm getting really tilted by these players now.
[9075.24s -> 9080.24s]  the Rakan W's in, they just stand there and watch me die.
[9081.68s -> 9082.76s]  Okay, it's fine.
[9082.76s -> 9084.48s]  Listen, I'm not gonna get too mad about it, it's fine.
[9084.48s -> 9086.80s]  I should have flashed the knockup, I guess,
[9086.80s -> 9087.84s]  even though in reality,
[9087.84s -> 9089.76s]  I should never have to flash the knockup,
[9089.76s -> 9090.96s]  but I should have flashed it
[9090.96s -> 9092.84s]  because I can't trust the teammates.
[9092.84s -> 9094.36s]  So what I'm saying is right there,
[9094.36s -> 9095.84s]  Karma and Fiddle were both right here.
[9095.84s -> 9097.24s]  I was being chased down.
[9097.24s -> 9100.30s]  They stood here, they didn't walk up to do anything.
[9100.30s -> 9101.68s]  They just stood and waited.
[9102.64s -> 9105.36s]  That pisses me off because I hate when players
[9106.40s -> 9108.40s]  play
[9108.40s -> 9115.41s]  Selfish and scared. It's my biggest pet peeve. It drives me fucking crazy, man
[9116.69s -> 9118.69s]  Sorry, I'm getting I'm losing my mind
[9119.29s -> 9129.70s]  Like it's so easy. It's fine. No, I I shouldn't have walked up and ego to it. It's on me
[9129.70s -> 9142.62s]  I want to still push this wave
[9143.06s -> 9157.11s]  Yeah, I'm losing it this by the way would be an example of a bad time for karma to run
[9157.11s -> 9164.14s]  She needs to come back bot. There's absolutely no reason for her to roam on that timer
[9165.02s -> 9168.66s]  There's also no reason for her to be in that bush over there. We should be playing up to try it
[9168.66s -> 9172.74s]  We're playing Kate Karma, right? We should be playing forward so that we can actually be aggressive
[9173.66s -> 9175.10s]  Kate Karma is a lane bully lane
[9175.10s -> 9179.52s]  We don't want to sit here and just do nothing if you pick karma you want to be aggressive you want to be
[9179.52s -> 9182.94s]  Playing up you want to be stunning. You want to be doing like aggressive things playing the game
[9183.42s -> 9198.55s]  We're level six. I'd really like to like go in. Yeah, like that was actually not bad by the karma
[9198.55s -> 9202.07s]  She w'd the Xayah and then I got to trap off of it. So that wasn't too bad
[9203.35s -> 9224.26s]  Not the worst not not bad. That was good. That was good
[9225.48s -> 9228.98s]  Really nice really nice. Okay, so I'm gonna back here cuz I don't want to overstay for the wave
[9229.40s -> 9244.81s]  I'm gonna grab boots
[9245.85s -> 9249.68s]  You know what I think a lot of it is too I
[9250.48s -> 9254.80s]  Think a lot of it is people get really scared when they like Rakan is really strong in this meta, right?
[9254.80s -> 9259.36s]  Like he's very very powerful. He's like numbers are a little too high right now. So like everything he does
[9259.36s -> 9263.68s]  is just a little too good. So I think people get nervous around Rakan, especially with Zaya,
[9263.68s -> 9267.76s]  because it's like when people would get nervous around Nami-Lucian. The lane like plays itself,
[9267.76s -> 9271.84s]  it's very strong, it's very hard to beat. But you can still see people making mistakes when they
[9271.84s -> 9281.87s]  play the lane. So you got to watch for that type of stuff. Now, a good way to play against
[9281.87s -> 9293.87s]  a Zaya once you hit six is you don't want to you don't want to ever walk melee range of her
[9293.87s -> 9298.11s]  or give her the ability to just kill you with the feathers. Your main goal here is going to be
[9298.51s -> 9304.51s]  Try and stay in a good spot when it comes to feathers, like I want to be to the side of her.
[9304.51s -> 9310.51s]  The side of her is the best option, like where she can't pull in, like I'll get hit by maybe a few, but she can't pull in all of them.
[9310.51s -> 9316.27s]  That's a really key thing when playing versus her.
[9316.27s -> 9321.27s]  Because I remember back in the day I didn't know how to play Versailla and I would always get fucking frustrated as shit.
[9321.27s -> 9325.27s]  So Rakan's 5. I want to hit tab, see Rakan's 5.
[9325.27s -> 9327.27s]  We shouldn't be able to die here
[9329.65s -> 9333.97s]  I want to push this wave in but I also need to stay away from where the rakan could be
[9336.00s -> 9338.32s]  So if you want to push waves in and reset the wave
[9339.20s -> 9340.24s]  uh
[9340.24s -> 9343.92s]  Make sure that you're standing as far away as you can from where they can engage on you
[9349.01s -> 9353.73s]  Now they're about to be six rakan is so they have a really strong level six. She has pickaxe and noon quiver
[9354.37s -> 9356.77s]  We do want to be a little hesitant here. We don't want to fight
[9358.53s -> 9360.69s]  Now i'm gonna kind of push this in a bit
[9361.49s -> 9367.01s]  We should have been spam pushing the whole wave because that's how Kate karma plays we just push push push push
[9367.85s -> 9371.37s]  But we played that that early roam by karma
[9372.65s -> 9374.65s]  Kind of put us behind on that
[9375.17s -> 9377.17s]  It's not a big deal. It's just something that
[9377.73s -> 9379.73s]  We have to adjust
[9382.96s -> 9408.65s]  Why does this say 88 and this say 90? Which one is it? Is it 88 or 90? I mean that guy's dead. I
[9408.65s -> 9411.83s]  I don't know what that Karma's thinking but
[9414.60s -> 9422.44s]  We probably have to give this Drake. I mean, maybe we could fight it if fiddle had ulti but
[9423.16s -> 9432.34s]  Him not having ult. Yeah, there's no way the higher one counts ward kills
[9433.38s -> 9435.38s]  why I
[9436.10s -> 9439.08s]  Think that's so stupid so they might try and engage here
[9440.82s -> 9446.08s]  Unless they somehow know Fiddles in the bush which would be impressive because we know it's not warded
[9446.08s -> 9472.70s]  So that'd be pretty impressive if they knew that we could actually rift. I'm just gonna ghost
[9473.50s -> 9488.24s]  This is crazy. What the fuck? Oh, this is interesting. They saw fed a hundred percent. Yeah, I don't know where though
[9488.24s -> 9490.24s]  It must it cuz he used this thing
[9491.68s -> 9493.68s]  Little used his whatever it's called
[9494.16s -> 9497.26s]  his effigy
[9497.26s -> 9498.74s]  I'd have to go look
[9498.74s -> 9504.30s]  One million. Oh, I guess I didn't see it. I
[9506.40s -> 9508.40s]  Should back I can get dove here
[9508.40s -> 9514.36s]  We don't know where Gragas is like if Gragas happens to be like he ease over this wall or something. I think it don't really easy
[9514.36s -> 9516.36s]  I'm greeting really hard
[9517.08s -> 9519.08s]  Greeting usually gets you killed
[9519.08s -> 9520.72s]  typically I
[9520.72s -> 9522.20s]  Shouldn't be doing this
[9522.20s -> 9527.50s]  They're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right?
[9528.16s -> 9529.76s]  It's like
[9529.76s -> 9536.12s]  If you know something's gonna be a bad habit, you should not do it. Just cue the bush
[9537.86s -> 9544.44s]  Okay, that was I meant use like an actual cue they could also be in the alcove
[9544.64s -> 9552.32s]  so I'm a little hesitant, but it's fine.
[9552.32s -> 9555.48s]  Okay, so the reason I stayed was because now I have my,
[9555.48s -> 9557.32s]  I have my mythic, right?
[9557.32s -> 9558.40s]  Because we finished the Cole
[9558.40s -> 9559.80s]  and we finished the mythic at the same time,
[9559.80s -> 9561.32s]  or finished the wave, so.
[9563.12s -> 9563.96s]  Now I have two options.
[9563.96s -> 9567.64s]  I can go Galeforce here to dodge a lot of their shits,
[9567.64s -> 9570.72s]  or I can do what sounds like a fun option.
[9572.20s -> 9573.56s]  We're gonna do Shield Bow.
[9574.64s -> 9577.32s]  I'm gonna show you guys why I like Shield Bow on Caitlyn.
[9577.92s -> 9584.90s]  It's not the best mythic but it's good into certain comps if you don't want to get
[9587.50s -> 9589.50s]  Yeah
[9589.62s -> 9591.88s]  Because I have a lack ready this game I don't have bloodline, right?
[9592.52s -> 9601.67s]  So I kind of want to go shield bow and then I'm gonna end up going
[9602.55s -> 9604.55s]  Either ie or I'm gonna end up going
[9605.11s -> 9610.81s]  like bloodthirster seconds ie or BT
[9612.19s -> 9614.19s]  Probably ie just because I
[9614.19s -> 9617.67s]  I think I think it's actually easier to go IE this game
[9618.11s -> 9637.94s]  But yeah, this is that kind of boring game. Our team's done really well though. So we just chill we gotta be a little care
[9638.58s -> 9639.62s]  Okay
[9639.62s -> 9657.34s]  It was kind of hard to do anything there
[9657.66s -> 9662.10s]  Even though I got like a few autos on the gragas. It's a little difficult to actually play the game there
[9662.54s -> 9671.22s]  Because if I walk up too far like see where cons are if I walk up too far I just get
[9671.58s -> 9677.03s]  Killed by recon. All right, I'm just gonna reset and go get boots
[9679.76s -> 9682.08s]  Typically any carry is really fucking boring
[9682.72s -> 9684.72s]  uh in games like this
[9685.52s -> 9687.44s]  Where
[9687.44s -> 9693.01s]  You can't really blow the game open
[9693.01s -> 9694.29s]  Oh i'm dead
[9694.29s -> 9695.41s]  maybe
[9695.41s -> 9697.41s]  Wait karma shield me. I'm not dead
[9700.26s -> 9701.46s]  nice
[9701.46s -> 9705.41s]  fuck
[9721.46s -> 9724.26s]  Motherfucker kovied me man. Here's like goby
[9726.86s -> 9734.27s]  We can fight this though. They have no ults
[9734.43s -> 9737.07s]  Like this is actually fightable. They have no xayah and no, uh
[9737.07s -> 9745.69s]  And this is also why it's really important that you relay to your team the cooldowns
[9745.69s -> 9746.69s]  of your team.
[9746.69s -> 9747.69s]  Remember that.
[9747.69s -> 9748.69s]  Don't forget that.
[9748.69s -> 9751.49s]  If somebody uses a big cooldown, tell your team.
[9751.49s -> 9754.25s]  Because that was an illegal dragon.
[9754.25s -> 9757.93s]  That was one of the most illegal things I've seen in a while.
[9757.93s -> 9778.40s]  Homie completely griefed that.
[9778.40s -> 9782.40s]  That's another very, very, very important thing that you need to take away from playing
[9782.40s -> 9786.86s]  league and being like, this is what I was saying about teamwork and shit earlier.
[9786.86s -> 9792.26s]  good at the game is a lot of spreading knowledge as well right like if you if
[9792.26s -> 9795.34s]  your team doesn't know if a flash is up or down you have to play completely
[9795.34s -> 9798.42s]  differently right like you got to think about the game in that in terms of that
[9798.42s -> 9801.54s]  as well like how many times have you seen like you know you're like oh I
[9801.54s -> 9808.39s]  can walk up here if this guy can't flash ult me or something right it
[9808.39s -> 9815.14s]  happens all the time wonder if I can kill a duskblade Z I don't know I
[9815.14s -> 9836.99s]  probably could uh I should go Madden what do you think about Teemo and other
[9836.99s -> 9844.94s]  top lane as AD carry. I play Teemo AD carry when I'm playing for fun sometimes. It's okay.
[9853.95s -> 9859.63s]  Yo, go look on your game, man. So during the mid game as Caitlyn, a few things that I can kind
[9859.63s -> 9863.39s]  of teach you. This was kind of a boring lane phase, right? Like we didn't really do that much.
[9863.95s -> 9868.35s]  The lane phase was essentially just like we died once and then, you know, everything all
[9868.35s -> 9873.55s]  hell broke loose. When you're walking up the fights like this, make sure that you're putting
[9873.55s -> 9887.78s]  traps down in places where the enemy has to walk. Just like that. Playing Caitlyn is not
[9887.78s -> 9892.50s]  always about just like autoing and getting Qs and shits. If you noticed during that fight I put
[9892.50s -> 9896.98s]  two traps here, two traps here. I forced the enemy team into like a location where they had
[9896.98s -> 9908.16s]  to eat traps or they uh they can't find us right? And even if like they avoid the traps
[9908.16s -> 9912.48s]  they're still having to like move their character in a very unique specific way that
[9912.48s -> 9918.47s]  that they probably don't want to do.
[9918.47s -> 9919.51s]  So you should always be thinking,
[9919.51s -> 9921.37s]  where should I put these traps down at the start of the fight?
[9921.37s -> 9923.27s]  Not like, how do I get autos off?
[9923.27s -> 9925.27s]  Think about using your traps to zone
[9925.27s -> 9927.35s]  and to like control the team fight before the fight starts
[9927.35s -> 9931.11s]  rather than using it to do damage.
[9931.11s -> 9934.23s]  Because they'll step in the traps themselves.
[9934.23s -> 9936.51s]  People will just, people are stupid.
[9936.51s -> 9937.35s]  They're bad.
[9937.35s -> 9938.63s]  People aren't paying attention.
[9938.63s -> 9939.47s]  Everything.
[9939.47s -> 9941.03s]  I'm bad.
[9941.03s -> 9941.87s]  You know what I mean?
[9941.87s -> 9943.29s]  People can't pay attention to every bush
[9943.29s -> 9945.47s]  that you're putting traps in during a big fight.
[9945.47s -> 9962.01s]  It's it's too much attention span. Nobody has it. Nice
[9964.26s -> 9967.57s]  Grab this red. Oh
[9967.57s -> 9969.99s]  Big tip for all the 80 carries and chat guys
[9970.81s -> 9972.33s]  I'm tell you right now
[9972.33s -> 9974.33s]  Once the 20-minute mark happens in league
[9975.01s -> 9977.13s]  Your junglers camps are no longer his I
[9977.97s -> 9982.15s]  Know I know junglers are gonna hate me for this. Okay. Listen, if you're a jungle player
[9982.15s -> 9984.95s]  You're like fuck this guy now. I hate him. Listen, you know, it's true
[9985.09s -> 9989.91s]  You know at 20 minutes your camps no longer like they're not yours anymore, man
[9989.91s -> 9997.51s]  Okay, like you you you you are full items at this point. Okay, like I want to be honest you would I'm taking your camps
[9997.99s -> 10014.07s]  I'm trying to get my third item as fast as humanly possible because 80 carries spike on three items extremely hard
[10014.53s -> 10024.45s]  Man, I want to walk top but we have no vision of this area. So it's a little scary
[10025.01s -> 10030.74s]  Like I said, I typically don't like to take
[10031.50s -> 10033.50s]  jungles camps early game ever
[10034.14s -> 10040.68s]  Because like that's why I say like at 20 minutes usually you have two items at this point if you're like farming decent
[10040.68s -> 10042.22s]  And you know, you know, etc
[10042.22s -> 10046.02s]  Sometimes they'll be faster, but usually it's around average of like you'll have your items at this points
[10048.65s -> 10051.65s]  Always be tabbing to the team fights, even if you're farming as well
[10073.28s -> 10075.28s]  Zed is in this bush
[10079.32s -> 10081.68s]  Wait, where is he? Wait, I'm stupid. Where'd he go? Oh
[10082.64s -> 10084.64s]  He died I killed him
[10085.40s -> 10094.77s]  Wow, I'm really smart. I like didn't notice that I killed that guy
[10096.01s -> 10102.40s]  I'm so dumb
[10102.40s -> 10111.20s]  80 carry brain right boys. I was like playing that so scared too because I was like I was like is he there
[10121.04s -> 10123.04s]  Pull the dragon out. Oh
[10123.92s -> 10129.20s]  I asked this yesterday. But what do you guys think the coolest looking dragon is I swear it's the I
[10130.20s -> 10132.20s]  Think Mountain Drake looks fucking sick
[10168.88s -> 10171.80s]  Welcome to the here. You saw that I like to push mid right?
[10173.44s -> 10176.76s]  That's mainly because we are karma just got picked off and
[10176.76s -> 10183.62s]  And I don't want to give them the option of pushing the wave. So by pushing the lane
[10184.12s -> 10207.56s]  Nice by pushing the the lane in it takes away an option for the enemy
[10208.18s -> 10210.60s]  That's something that a lot of people think like oh, I just want farm
[10210.60s -> 10216.40s]  I don't care about the farm right like when I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game and I'm pushing like a
[10216.92s -> 10220.84s]  Mid mid wave in before a fight if we're just sieging around the Baron
[10222.14s -> 10226.62s]  Having that wave pushed in gives them gives us an another option. I'm like what we can do in the game
[10227.30s -> 10232.36s]  And it takes you three seconds to push it in so if the fights already over and
[10233.30s -> 10237.02s]  You have time always be paying attention to like trying to push in waves
[10237.50s -> 10242.76s]  So that you can create a little bit of that pressure. Yo hail. Thank you so much for the 14 man. Welcome back
[10243.70s -> 10246.18s]  What do I get next? I kind of want to get BT
[10247.02s -> 10253.99s]  I'm gonna get BT. I could get Dom's but I think BT is better because
[10254.51s -> 10258.95s]  The I already have over here, right? So the shield from BT plus shield bow plus IE
[10258.95s -> 10261.95s]  I don't think I'll be able to die. Okay, I think I'm unkillable
[10263.27s -> 10265.27s]  Actually, like actually unkillable
[10265.81s -> 10270.39s]  So here I'm gonna actually give these camps the fiddle because he's literally pathing to them. I don't want to be an asshole, but
[10271.67s -> 10289.28s]  Wow, what just happened? I'm bad. I
[10290.54s -> 10293.10s]  Feel like I got hooked by cled. Oh
[10294.42s -> 10296.02s]  He flashed
[10296.02s -> 10297.66s]  Okay, I
[10297.66s -> 10299.86s]  Was like I feel like what just happened was like I
[10299.86s -> 10304.98s]  I mispositioned because like I went up here right like I ghosted went up here because there was two people here two people here
[10305.38s -> 10310.74s]  I put traps down these kind of sloppy traps and then I positioned here and then clad flash cued me under the yeah
[10310.74s -> 10312.74s]  Okay, that makes sense
[10312.74s -> 10316.16s]  I'm just bad
[10316.16s -> 10319.51s]  it was okay though because
[10319.51s -> 10322.31s]  if the entire enemy team has to literally
[10325.51s -> 10330.39s]  Like double flash on you to kill you under the turret and then your team follows up. It's not that big of a deal
[10331.03s -> 10333.03s]  Galeforce would have saved me there though, actually
[10333.03s -> 10340.48s]  Okay, Galeforce totally gonna save me
[10341.44s -> 10343.44s]  Cuz he has serpents
[10345.71s -> 10350.87s]  Serpents definitely shits on chill bow. I'm kind of stupid for going show by this game. I
[10353.11s -> 10357.71s]  Wanted to try it out cuz I when I before when I was playing Caitlin like before the IE rework and everything
[10358.15s -> 10359.79s]  everybody would go
[10359.79s -> 10363.59s]  Or there was like one guy in challenger would go shield bow into shit every game
[10363.83s -> 10366.23s]  And I wanted to see if like it was still viable
[10366.23s -> 10368.75s]  But there might just be better options now like always scale force a
[10369.71s -> 10376.18s]  BT or something. Oh my god. I flashed late. I'm dead
[10379.05s -> 10382.55s]  Dude, I flashed late for some reason. I'm so dumb
[10383.29s -> 10385.29s]  my bad
[10385.59s -> 10387.29s]  Let's give him an MB
[10387.29s -> 10389.29s]  Like my brain is moving slowly
[10389.97s -> 10391.97s]  Like I can feel it turning
[10392.69s -> 10394.69s]  I'm just playing bad
[10394.73s -> 10398.33s]  Like I I was baiting the Kled to go in on me because karma was there
[10398.43s -> 10401.17s]  But what I need to do is I need to trap on top myself when he goes in
[10401.67s -> 10408.30s]  Then I need to flash net and the clutches dies. You can also just kill him. I
[10410.14s -> 10412.44s]  Was gonna say they have nothing
[10413.14s -> 10424.90s]  We just play for dragon here. I don't know why I'm playing so bad today. I played bad yesterday, too
[10424.90s -> 10427.44s]  I don't know what's going on. My like brain is broken
[10444.95s -> 10447.11s]  Do the recon was trying so hard. Oh
[10482.39s -> 10490.33s]  I've made so many mistakes this game. I fucked up positioning mechanics farm
[10491.25s -> 10499.49s]  All kinds of shit. I
[10499.81s -> 10509.79s]  Still don't want Lord Dom's actually. I don't think Lord Dom's is good this game
[10510.63s -> 10515.11s]  Like they have no armor like quite as work treads
[10516.87s -> 10518.87s]  Which I feel like
[10519.87s -> 10521.87s]  Really bad indoor team but
[10530.98s -> 10534.86s]  Oh a little tip that you guys can have for Caitlin to when you are
[10535.98s -> 10537.98s]  Like barons up in 50 seconds, right?
[10537.98s -> 10543.42s]  So a little thing you can do that's actually kind of fun is you want to be at the objective before the like
[10543.74s -> 10547.66s]  rule with them when an objectives coming up you always want to be on that side of the map before the before the
[10547.66s -> 10549.14s]  objective comes up
[10549.14s -> 10550.98s]  but
[10550.98s -> 10552.98s]  You can put down traps
[10553.74s -> 10555.74s]  in the bushes
[10555.82s -> 10559.42s]  Around the objectives and people will face check them and you can just one tap them away game
[10561.18s -> 10563.18s]  It's actually incredibly fun
[10563.62s -> 10569.60s]  Like you just put them in the corners of the bushes where people have to walk
[10570.16s -> 10591.14s]  Like right here. I can put it right between the turret. I don't know why I didn't ghosts
[10592.02s -> 10599.35s]  I'll be honest. I have no idea why I didn't ghosts. I was like saving it for something. I'm not sure what
[10602.43s -> 10605.29s]  Next year a birthday present who the fuck knows I
[10609.30s -> 10611.44s]  Could have one-shot that guy if I was better at Kate. I
[10613.22s -> 10616.50s]  Did a really classic combo right there I just didn't cue cuz I'm bad I
[10618.52s -> 10621.82s]  Should have when he hit the trap your two headshots sit on him for a few seconds
[10621.82s -> 10625.68s]  So what I should have done is I should have instantly queued on top of the trap then auto-autoed and he would have died
[10626.14s -> 10631.28s]  Because your Q does the max damage when they're trapped too. So it would have been like just a perfect three shot
[10631.78s -> 10633.26s]  but I said I
[10633.26s -> 10636.34s]  Don't play Kate enough and my muscle memories kind of trash sometimes so
[10637.66s -> 10651.06s]  That was my bad. Oh, we're getting cladded. I
[10651.98s -> 10653.98s]  don't know where he is, but I
[10671.12s -> 10672.64s]  Shouldn't have done that
[10672.64s -> 10678.85s]  I'm limit testing really hard right now. I suggest you guys don't limit test
[10678.85s -> 10682.89s]  Well, actually I do think you should limit test but not if you want to win like play safer like right there
[10682.89s -> 10685.93s]  The play wasn't to go back in the play was to like back off
[10685.93s -> 10692.04s]  But I wanted to see if I could like I wanted to see if I was terrible or not
[10693.28s -> 10695.04s]  you know, I
[10695.04s -> 10697.04s]  was
[10697.32s -> 10703.90s]  But yeah, I mean the combo with Kate is like if they're trapped you want to queue while they're in the trap essentially because
[10705.00s -> 10708.76s]  Your auto will always give you the range. So if you auto and then queue
[10708.76s -> 10718.76s]  When they're trapped, they get, not a lot of people know this because I just found this out like a few years or like after I should have.
[10718.76s -> 10728.76s]  When you queue on top of a K-trap, the way K-HQ works is when you queue, the initial, like it hits initially and then it does less damage to the targets behind it, right?
[10728.76s -> 10731.76s]  It's very narrow and then it like gets bigger.
[10731.76s -> 10737.92s]  it like gets bigger so when they're trapped though it does the maximum Q damage that it can do
[10737.92s -> 10742.48s]  in like the isolation of the Q so that's why when people are trapped you want to open up with your
[10742.48s -> 10751.11s]  Q you either want to net into the Q and then double auto or you want to net or you want to
[10751.11s -> 10757.75s]  like you want to Q then trap net at the same time then double auto you basically it's a very
[10757.75s -> 10761.35s]  interesting way to play it you always want to try and overlay a trap on your trap
[10761.35s -> 10767.35s]  So when they get trapped you can overlay a second trap to either in front of them or behind them
[10767.35s -> 10771.55s]  And what will happen is there's actually like a little mini like I want to say one second
[10772.23s -> 10775.47s]  Cool-down of being able to be trapped right like a little 1.5 to 2 second cooldown
[10775.85s -> 10779.73s]  But what can happen is they sit in the trap then what you can do is your net can slow them
[10779.79s -> 10782.51s]  So you can you can actually queue in the first trap
[10782.59s -> 10788.67s]  Then you can drop a second trap net slow them into the second trap and then triple auto headshot them from all three
[10788.67s -> 10790.67s]  Of the net the two traps
[10790.67s -> 10806.29s]  It's really complicated sounding, but this man just redeemed end my stream whenever you
[10806.29s -> 10813.08s]  want.
[10813.08s -> 10814.08s]  What?
[10814.08s -> 10817.61s]  Why?
[10817.61s -> 10829.13s]  Why would you want to end my stream right now?
[10829.13s -> 10838.27s]  Why would you want to be that guy?
[10838.27s -> 10839.27s]  Wow.
[10839.27s -> 10850.48s]  Okay.
[10850.48s -> 10854.68s]  Don't end, just change the camera position.
[10854.68s -> 10862.15s]  Did you just spend 1 million points to tell me to put the camera back on the right
[10862.15s -> 10879.28s]  side of my fucking no way no way you just did that I was like this man is
[10879.28s -> 10884.52s]  just flexing he's just like yeah I got some points to spare I guess I could like
[10884.52s -> 10904.45s]  throw him you know all right fine there's that better is that better
[10904.45s -> 10913.04s]  drink water actually that's a good one I'll be our B I'm gonna get some
[10913.04s -> 10920.61s]  water should we plan our main I kind of want to try and hit GM yeah let's
[10920.61s -> 10926.13s]  get on our main account it's like 1 p.m. so it's like 3 p.m. Eastern I think I can
[10926.13s -> 10933.23s]  get queues at the moment let me get some water and then we'll queue up or
[10933.23s -> 10943.92s]  we'll queue up then get some water real quick because I think I think it's
[10943.92s -> 10946.52s]  late enough in the day I can get queues now without waiting 40 minutes
[10946.52s -> 10956.72s]  by the way it is it is a teaching stream when I'm doing that like 80
[10956.72s -> 10959.04s]  carry Academy thing so if you guys have any questions you want to ask or
[10959.04s -> 10962.16s]  like you guys can ignore that if you guys have any questions you want to
[10962.16s -> 10965.52s]  ask or anything like that you know if we're just chilling between games
[10965.52s -> 10970.40s]  Just ask whatever you want. I I can answer a lot easier between games that I can in game
[10971.24s -> 10974.20s]  You know, it's a lot easier for me to see that shit. I try and answer in game
[10974.20s -> 10977.92s]  But like sometimes I'm like focusing and shit. So it's a little harder. I
[10984.79s -> 10988.03s]  Am gonna get some water though. So I'll be right back. Okay
[10989.11s -> 10991.11s]  Talk amongst yourselves
[10991.31s -> 10994.77s]  Is Kraken troll on Kate? No, Kraken's gonna Kate
[10995.63s -> 10999.55s]  you can go Kraken into bloodthirster or Kraken in the ie if you really need it if
[10999.55s -> 11012.05s]  If they have tanks, say they have Sion, Sejuani, stuff like that, you're the only tank killer on the team, you have to go Kraken sometimes.
[11012.05s -> 11075.05s]  Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop
[11075.05s -> 11079.05s]  Best day of my life
[11079.05s -> 11082.05s]  My life
[12884.45s -> 12896.82s]  It's a lucky da, da, da.
[12896.82s -> 12900.28s]  It's a lucky da, da, da, da, da.
[12900.28s -> 12906.01s]  Ba-ba-da-ba-ba-ba, da, da, da, da.
[12906.01s -> 12909.01s]  Time to set, and then check the new business.
[12909.01s -> 12912.47s]  Bum-chit-bum-chit-bum-chit-bum-chit-bum.
[12912.47s -> 12917.69s]  Bum-chit-bum-chit-bum.
[12919.69s -> 12921.69s]  Bum-chit-bum-chit.
[12922.85s -> 12926.29s]  Bum-chit-bum-chit-bum-chit-bum.
[12926.29s -> 12931.57s]  Like, I'm just gonna straight up leave, go buy T2 boots, and that's gonna be my power spike for Ashe right now.
[12933.71s -> 12937.15s]  They have so many things that I can dodge on their team. Like, look at this shit, right?
[12937.15s -> 12942.31s]  Like, Morg binding, T2 boots, super easy to dodge if she can't flash it on me, right?
[12942.31s -> 12947.19s]  Like, if she can't flash melee range with the Morg bind, it's- I should never get hit by it unless I have no fingers.
[12947.95s -> 12949.65s]  Ezreal Q, easy to dodge.
[12950.19s -> 12951.83s]  Xerath, easy to dodge.
[12952.07s -> 12956.63s]  This guy, whatever the fuck, uh, Kha'Zix, Bugman, he's a melee champ, so...
[12956.63s -> 12966.87s]  Boots have value etc. Also the cool thing about boots boots rush. Ash is she doesn't have damage
[12968.39s -> 12972.27s]  That if I'm good at spacing like the better at spacing you are
[12973.59s -> 12975.59s]  You can actually just 1v2
[12976.59s -> 12978.59s]  Especially against double skill shots like this
[12979.79s -> 13005.27s]  It's pretty fun
[13005.27s -> 13007.77s]  Fuck if I juke that last Q I would have killed that guy
[13008.39s -> 13014.31s]  Dude, Xerath actually fucked us so bad though. That was a good fight until Xerath just showed up and beat our ass
[13014.99s -> 13033.76s]  Yeah, just get the just get the minion wave it's kind of funny to watch though because I do so little damage
[13034.16s -> 13036.24s]  But I also like just perma
[13036.84s -> 13038.84s]  Slow so they can't do anything about it
[13041.59s -> 13045.71s]  Hopefully when TF gets six he can come bot and we can fuck over there bot lane
[13047.11s -> 13049.11s]  I'm hoping that that's the case
[13055.66s -> 13064.18s]  We're gonna roam to mid Kha'zix is also mid TF's dead. That was a good roam
[13064.58s -> 13072.49s]  I'm gonna push this so that maybe we can play for a dragon
[13072.49s -> 13079.42s]  Because they might go for a dragon here and I think we can stop it. We have TF ults
[13084.06s -> 13089.24s]  Yep, nice. We just leave
[13090.24s -> 13093.78s]  We don't need to actually chase or do anything crazy. We're just stopping the dragon. That's all we're doing
[13095.12s -> 13104.67s]  Right, we don't want to give him a free drink see the t2 boots are just broken. They're broken as shit
[13105.27s -> 13114.01s]  Because you can just see like I can I can pretty much just
[13114.65s -> 13121.22s]  I'm just too fast for them to deal with like look at this. It's it's insane
[13121.22s -> 13134.39s]  And that's why I value like the tier two boots on champions
[13134.39s -> 13139.47s]  Especially like ash where you can be extra egregious with it because like her slow
[13140.47s -> 13144.47s]  Imagine it's like, you know, it's the same idea as vein right when you think about it. It's like, okay, so
[13145.31s -> 13150.97s]  What's really annoying trying to run away from a vein, right? She gets boots too and you're like, god damn it man
[13150.97s -> 13153.83s]  She's so fast same thing with ash. Oh wait now you're slow
[13154.91s -> 13157.47s]  So it's even more annoying you try you try and go in on her
[13157.47s -> 13163.25s]  She just spaces you walks away a bit now. You're just sitting there waddling towards her slowly just upset tilted frustrated
[13164.47s -> 13166.47s]  You know, it's like your middle school dance
[13166.95s -> 13190.92s]  You know what? I think this is actually a shield bow game
[13192.48s -> 13196.52s]  It is I was gonna go Bork, but I think this is a shield bow game
[13198.08s -> 13201.12s]  It could be a gale force game to both both are both revival
[13201.12s -> 13206.80s]  But uh, I actually I might be one of the I might be in the minority here with this
[13206.80s -> 13210.78s]  I think work rush on ash is actually good sometimes
[13212.04s -> 13216.08s]  Like I think if I was versus some tanks like, you know, like a scion or something like that
[13216.08s -> 13218.36s]  I actually think board crush and ash is kind of cracked
[13219.52s -> 13224.00s]  Like yeah, it stalls out like you make the argument like it stalls out your three item or two item
[13224.28s -> 13226.52s]  But it's it feels kind of nuts
[13226.52s -> 13232.80s]  Also, this is a really OP thing that you can do. I should have hawkshotted sooner. I knew that they were doing
[13233.32s -> 13236.40s]  Rift, but I'm not paying attention as much as I should be
[13237.12s -> 13243.69s]  so
[13243.69s -> 13249.69s]  Because what you can do is you can hawkshot to tell your team where the enemy jungler is and get information yourself. I
[13253.54s -> 13255.54s]  Mean this Morgana is level five
[13255.94s -> 13259.89s]  We could fight just because Morg is five right now
[13261.69s -> 13263.69s]  I kind of want to try
[13269.64s -> 13271.64s]  My MooMoo didn't want to go in.
[13271.72s -> 13275.79s]  My bad.
[13275.79s -> 13277.79s]  I'm a little sad. I'm not gonna lie because
[13278.19s -> 13282.19s]  I do feel like we win these fights, but a MooMoo wants to wait for six.
[13282.99s -> 13288.43s]  Which is fine. But like I said, you guys know me. I like to actually fight and be active in the lane early.
[13289.15s -> 13291.15s]  Because I know that we can fight, right?
[13292.27s -> 13294.27s]  And so it's like obviously, you know,
[13303.55s -> 13305.55s]  Oh, this is really rough.
[13306.27s -> 13309.84s]  I can't do anything
[13309.84s -> 13311.84s]  Because Xerath's here.
[13312.16s -> 13314.60s]  TF's coming with ult though.
[13314.60s -> 13315.60s]  I don't have ult.
[13315.60s -> 13318.04s]  God damn it, if I had ult, this would be so god tier.
[13318.04s -> 13323.67s]  God, you have no idea how OP this would be if I had ulti, man.
[13323.67s -> 13327.64s]  Whatever, I'm bad.
[13327.64s -> 13328.64s]  I want to push this wave out.
[13328.64s -> 13332.04s]  I'm assuming they're all backing.
[13332.04s -> 13333.72s]  I think we penta there with ult.
[13333.72s -> 13334.72s]  We even killed the top laner.
[13334.72s -> 13336.04s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[13336.04s -> 13338.34s]  Why did I stay?
[13338.34s -> 13340.80s]  I knew Kha'Zix would do that.
[13340.80s -> 13342.20s]  I have to retrain my brain.
[13342.20s -> 13345.20s]  Kha'Zix players are rats and I have to retrain my brain to remember that they
[13345.20s -> 13351.36s]  will sit in a bush for 30 minutes lose all of their farm to get one kill i like always forget that
[13355.22s -> 13357.54s]  like kha'zix players are absolute fucking rats
[13361.68s -> 13367.52s]  like i respect rengar players more than kha'zix players yeah i said it i know hot take i know
[13367.52s -> 13381.88s]  but i do i'm gonna try an arrow right here got him you know that guy's pissed by the way
[13381.88s -> 13392.12s]  God damn it. He's gonna try and ult me from the bush
[13393.32s -> 13398.84s]  You can always tell that you're about to get ulted when an Ezreal big big tip for you guys if an Ezreal ever walks
[13398.84s -> 13401.58s]  out of vision expect that he's ulting you I
[13403.12s -> 13404.48s]  You would not believe
[13404.48s -> 13410.68s]  You would not believe the amount of people that I kill with Ezreal by simply walking into a bush and ulting them and they
[13410.68s -> 13412.68s]  Forget that I exist
[13412.72s -> 13415.18s]  I'm not I'm not even kidding it happens so often
[13415.18s -> 13419.30s]  They're just like, oh, yeah, he went in the bush. He's gonna hit his ult key
[13420.02s -> 13423.26s]  Like I it is comical how often it happens
[13423.94s -> 13425.94s]  And I'm sure you guys have died to it, too
[13427.26s -> 13431.44s]  Because it's like a thing where like you never see it you barely you don't see Ezreal that often, right?
[13431.66s -> 13434.66s]  So because you probably don't see Ezreal too often. You're always like, oh
[13437.01s -> 13445.66s]  Interesting type shit. I'm gonna grab this plate and then I'm gonna back up
[13445.66s -> 13452.50s]  up. Kha'Zix is coming down here, so I'm gonna back the fuck up. So I don't have arrow for
[13452.50s -> 13462.06s]  20. Ezreal has Triforce, we need to back up a bit. We might have to give dragon. I
[13462.06s -> 13473.72s]  could see giving dragon being okay though, it's not that bad. Yeah, it's not the worst
[13473.72s -> 13480.52s]  to give drake here. I could even back so we don't get dove. Like, if we back now,
[13480.52s -> 13487.04s]  we might lose bot turret, but I can't walk up. Yeah, that's what I didn't want
[13487.04s -> 13502.69s]  have happen see that's i'm telling you man rats absolute rats causics players are rats man absolute
[13503.25s -> 13526.96s]  literal rats oh that's close he has a good dodge i can't even walk up bot uh i can wait
[13526.96s -> 13533.84s]  for the turret but i can't walk up i'll just die that's another thing you have to just accept
[13533.84s -> 13540.00s]  like i'm down 40 cs this game because we've just been getting weak sided and we've also been getting uh
[13542.00s -> 13544.00s]  Like amumu is not very good
[13545.12s -> 13548.16s]  I don't I don't have a better way to say it. I don't have like a nice way to say it
[13548.24s -> 13550.24s]  He's not having a good game
[13551.44s -> 13554.00s]  And when your support doesn't have a good game, you don't have a good game early
[13554.88s -> 13557.28s]  so the best thing you can do is just try and uh
[13558.00s -> 13561.36s]  Farm up what you can don't die and scale for late
[13562.36s -> 13567.07s]  It's all you can really do as an ad carry when your support sucks
[13568.43s -> 13570.43s]  it feels really bad, but
[13571.75s -> 13584.75s]  Sometimes you just got to accept it right this Ezreal's not bad, but he's not good either. Oh
[13585.81s -> 13588.17s]  This guy's gonna try and hold me. I'm an ult kill range here
[13589.05s -> 13606.37s]  Nice. I don't have ult up yet guys. I
[13607.35s -> 13609.49s]  Don't have ult up yet. I can't ulti. I
[13610.55s -> 13613.11s]  Have ult now, but we need to bait them in a bit. I
[13613.11s -> 13617.82s]  I don't even want to use my ult right now to be honest with you
[13618.94s -> 13620.94s]  Like I I really don't
[13621.86s -> 13625.94s]  You know, what's funny that Zarya is actually pretty good I've played against them a few times in the past few seasons
[13626.50s -> 13629.50s]  He's actually not bad. He used to be a support main
[13630.86s -> 13636.91s]  Like he played Zarya support. That's why I recognized his name
[13643.09s -> 13648.13s]  We should not go for this refs. I'm on a bad timer for this
[13648.13s -> 13675.82s]  I don't want to arrow that because the the Fiora can totally the Fiora can do whatever
[13675.82s -> 13686.22s]  it's called and the Fiora can uh what's it whatever it's called uh w it if she's fast
[13686.22s -> 13690.32s]  enough and I didn't want to get my team killed the real issue here is that we're
[13690.32s -> 13696.40s]  forcing okay I'll tell you exactly what the real issue is we're forcing too many
[13696.40s -> 13701.12s]  fights for no reason right now so like we're all forcing tons of fights at the moment right but
[13701.12s -> 13706.80s]  there's no reason for us to force these fights that's that's why my team's getting uh tilted
[13706.80s -> 13712.88s]  right like for some reason the amumu and the uh tf are both just like inting and they're
[13712.88s -> 13718.24s]  both getting frustrated but we actually win the game if we play it slow like we can we can
[13718.24s -> 13729.26s]  slow play this game out in scale but it just takes time because i specifically picked ash so
[13729.26s -> 13732.10s]  so that we could, we had an answer for Zerath.
[13732.10s -> 13733.58s]  Cause we have TF and Ashe, right?
[13733.58s -> 13735.82s]  So we have, we have a really good answer for him.
[13735.82s -> 13736.74s]  The problem is,
[13738.54s -> 13740.78s]  we need to like stop tilting and just like
[13740.78s -> 13742.78s]  understand that we can deal with him later.
[13742.78s -> 13744.82s]  He's not like a, he's not like an A-Soul, right?
[13744.82s -> 13747.02s]  Like A-Soul is one of those champs that like,
[13747.02s -> 13748.06s]  you can't deal with.
[13751.38s -> 13753.86s]  Why did my Amumu wait to use ulti?
[13755.18s -> 13756.02s]  What?
[13757.26s -> 13758.60s]  He was in range.
[13758.60s -> 13773.16s]  I know he was. Oh nice. Okay, we got a kill. We need TF to play the game too though.
[13774.84s -> 13782.74s]  Our TF is really tilted so he's just sitting bot. Amumu is extra tilted too but I mean
[13783.62s -> 13786.74s]  I'll be I'll be honest the Amumu is playing worse than TF. It's just that he's
[13787.46s -> 13792.10s]  dude I hate when stuff happens like this. Stop stop pinging the guy man. He's already
[13792.10s -> 13795.94s]  frustrated. You pinging him is not going to make him less frustrated. You're just going
[13795.94s -> 13806.50s]  gonna piss him off more. Like just play dude. We have a really good team comp. Like we're
[13806.50s -> 13816.24s]  behind right now but we have a good team comp. We should give this dragon by the way.
[13816.24s -> 13823.32s]  Like a thousand percent. We don't have TF ults. Like maybe we could fight this but
[13823.32s -> 13826.88s]  the morg is here so she can spell with my arrow. They got rift. Like we should
[13826.88s -> 13834.44s]  give the drake. We also have no vision control of this area. So this is another
[13834.44s -> 13839.80s]  thing of like why you guys wonder like why I play support in this elo like I get asked a lot like
[13839.80s -> 13845.00s]  why are you a support main now I'm still an AD main but the thing is it's really hard uh to
[13845.00s -> 13851.40s]  play the game when your supports don't ward correctly we can give this guys we can give it's
[13851.40s -> 13856.36s]  not a huge deal Nars top we do not have to fight this guys we don't have to fight this
[13857.32s -> 13866.10s]  it's back up yeah like this isn't a fight it's only second dragon it's nothing
[13866.10s -> 13869.10s]  Wow, I suck at CSing.
[13869.10s -> 13882.50s]  But you see how little vision control we have on the map right now?
[13882.50s -> 13885.58s]  We have one ward here and that's about it.
[13885.58s -> 13889.26s]  Vision control is, I say it's 90% of the game in solo queue.
[13889.26s -> 13891.74s]  That's why I feel like supports are like the unsung hero.
[13891.74s -> 13895.26s]  Like when you get a support who knows how to properly throw out vision control,
[13895.26s -> 13896.26s]  it feels insane.
[13896.26s -> 13904.96s]  We just gotta push.
[13904.96s -> 13906.94s]  I do have hawk shot in a second.
[13906.94s -> 13908.64s]  We can see if they're on this.
[13908.64s -> 13910.84s]  Okay, they're not.
[13910.84s -> 13914.00s]  I can volley we can back up
[13916.35s -> 13918.19s]  Kha'Zix is above me right now
[13918.19s -> 13925.09s]  Okay, Kha'Zix wasted his ults. That's not bad
[13926.77s -> 13932.99s]  We should back I don't want to take this fight TF could ulti, but he's not right
[13934.21s -> 13938.41s]  Like this this is one of those moments where like I actually think we actually could have killed two of them right there
[13938.93s -> 13940.93s]  If TF ulted
[13940.97s -> 13950.40s]  Because they were out of position really hard. But again, it's not like I think they're gonna walk
[13950.40s -> 13952.40s]  I think Kha'Zix is
[13953.04s -> 13955.04s]  Yeah, he's he's somewhere up here. I don't know where he is
[13955.92s -> 13960.02s]  And I can't I can't hawk shot. I wasted my hawk shot for this dragon or this Baron
[13960.56s -> 13964.06s]  They could be on Baron
[13964.38s -> 13966.38s]  We need to check but I have no hawk shots
[13966.86s -> 13970.66s]  Okay, they're not they're not we're chilling good. Good. Yeah, I need a hundred golds
[13983.74s -> 14003.77s]  Yeah, I'm aware. I'm getting ganked. I'm I'm fully fucking aware. Trust me. I'm just trying to force them to make a choice
[14003.77s -> 14019.54s]  I probably wasn't a great use of my ghost, but I say we bail I need to go get my item
[14021.96s -> 14034.45s]  Ezreal's just pushing aside somehow uncontested over there. Somebody just TP'd bot. What?
[14037.75s -> 14039.75s]  What the fuck is this Amumu doing?
[14040.43s -> 14042.43s]  What is my team doing? What are you guys doing?
[14043.03s -> 14054.54s]  This is so awkward, man. I mean guys
[14055.66s -> 14057.66s]  Guys kill the Kha'zix. Oh
[14058.62s -> 14060.62s]  Thank God. I
[14060.62s -> 14064.70s]  I don't know why Kha'Zix just dove to kill me, of all people.
[14065.82s -> 14069.66s]  My man just like wanted me dead. He was like, yeah, fuck that AD carry guy.
[14070.70s -> 14072.70s]  Like, okay.
[14073.06s -> 14075.06s]  Sure.
[14075.42s -> 14084.09s]  Fuck me. What do I want? I feel like I need damage, but I don't know what gives me the highest damage here.
[14084.97s -> 14086.77s]  Maybe just...
[14086.77s -> 14093.66s]  I don't know. Maybe just PD.
[14094.58s -> 14103.78s]  I'm not actually sure IE would be good, but it doesn't give me like more it gives me like IE is interesting in this position
[14105.48s -> 14108.04s]  Like I almost want more movement speed from the like PD
[14109.08s -> 14113.68s]  Even though normally like the utilities better like maybe BT is still the best and I'm just trolling
[14114.24s -> 14126.04s]  We can just do dragon right now. They have no TP or Baron. I think we totally actually could do this
[14127.04s -> 14134.22s]  I'm down to try if you if you want to Rengar. They got two people blot. They're setting up for dragon vision right now
[14134.70s -> 14137.82s]  I'm actually kind of down to just try and play for Baron here
[14144.73s -> 14149.29s]  Like we could bait Baron here and force them to walk into us with my arrow I
[14177.24s -> 14179.80s]  Want to stay together because I don't know where the Kha'Zix is
[14182.45s -> 14198.90s]  Found him. What is my MUMU doing? Dude? He has smite like I pull it out if you're gonna do this, right? Like
[14198.90s -> 14201.46s]  Like, use your brain, man.
[14201.46s -> 14219.76s]  Alright, now we do Baron though, we have to.
[14219.76s -> 14224.70s]  We have to do Baron.
[14224.70s -> 14227.14s]  This is like one of the worst players I've ever seen this Amumu.
[14227.14s -> 14230.38s]  He has no clue what he's doing, by the way.
[14230.38s -> 14236.77s]  Like he's so dumb.
[14236.77s -> 14238.53s]  He's like flaming the TF.
[14238.53s -> 14242.01s]  In his mind, he's so angry at this TF that he's ignoring every single thing that's
[14242.01s -> 14243.01s]  going on.
[14243.01s -> 14247.89s]  Like he's ignoring that like the dragon was a bad call to begin with.
[14247.89s -> 14251.31s]  And if we are gonna do that dragon, we have to zone the fucking jungler because
[14251.31s -> 14254.27s]  because he has smite, right?
[14254.27s -> 14258.87s]  So it's like, what are you talking about, man?
[14258.87s -> 14261.07s]  These players are crazy.
[14261.07s -> 14263.63s]  It just feels to me like they're so angry at everything.
[14263.63s -> 14266.68s]  It's kind of funny.
[14266.68s -> 14267.98s]  Okay, I got three items now.
[14267.98s -> 14268.86s]  I went for the PD,
[14268.86s -> 14270.54s]  because I kind of think the extra movement speed
[14270.54s -> 14275.81s]  and the extra, it'll help a lot.
[14275.81s -> 14278.95s]  I will say, both the junglers are playing really well.
[14278.95s -> 14281.45s]  This game is like, interesting.
[14283.01s -> 14284.11s]  Like both the assassin junglers
[14284.11s -> 14286.47s]  playing pretty well. The enemy Xerath is playing pretty decent.
[14293.16s -> 14298.16s]  Uh, what? That is not a, I mean, that was embarrassing.
[14298.16s -> 14299.80s]  Like I don't even have words for that.
[14301.84s -> 14306.90s]  Like I genuinely don't have words for that shit. I missed.
[14311.94s -> 14322.35s]  I can't see. We have no vision, man. Like we have no vision.
[14323.51s -> 14326.51s]  Nothing's warded because the Mumu didn't put any wards down.
[14326.51s -> 14339.76s]  So I can't fight because literally we're standing there in this area and there's nothing warded.
[14339.76s -> 14344.00s]  The best part is all Amumu had to do was not die before that fight and we auto win.
[14344.00s -> 14346.84s]  Like we were winning so hard.
[14346.84s -> 14350.68s]  But this Amumu is actually solo losing us the game with his fucking ego.
[14350.68s -> 14355.20s]  God, support players are so bad at League!
[14355.20s -> 14359.63s]  Actually!
[14359.63s -> 14360.91s]  And they'll deflect!
[14360.91s -> 14364.87s]  players will lie to themselves about how good they are and tell them that it's
[14364.87s -> 14370.35s]  always their team's fault but they'll drop nine deaths have 9kp in a fucking
[14370.35s -> 14385.42s]  23 kill game and then blame their fucking team it's crazy please ward
[14385.42s -> 14407.81s]  things man oh my god he's dead again guys why are we up here top why are we
[14407.81s -> 14422.11s]  top guys why are we three manning top right now holy crap my teammates are
[14422.11s -> 14434.28s]  absolute apes like what am I watching men they just three man's top oh my god
[14434.28s -> 14442.98s]  like these are the worst players I've ever fucking seen like we had the game
[14442.98s -> 14447.36s]  in our hands and then all of a sudden my team's like you know what I don't
[14447.36s -> 14454.16s]  actually want to win and I'm like why and they're like well you see I have an ego and you're like oh
[14454.16s -> 14460.48s]  I see this is why I can't play ad carry in zero I'm sorry I can't I have to play support in the
[14460.48s -> 14467.60s]  zero because ad carry is actually not playable when the entire game is decided by jungle
[14467.60s -> 14474.00s]  support and mid ad carry just does not decide any of the league of legends games below grand
[14474.00s -> 14478.76s]  Master. Not one of them. Like last game, we popped off and we won because we were the
[14478.76s -> 14485.48s]  better AD carry, right? This game, it doesn't matter. Because TF does 11k damage, doesn't
[14485.48s -> 14491.62s]  ulti bot more than one time. Like Rengar did well, Gnar did well, but they also
[14491.62s -> 14498.94s]  had a horrible macro. Like it is insane to me how easy support is as a role and
[14498.94s -> 14503.92s]  it just how dog shit every support player is on the server. Like your role requires
[14503.92s -> 14506.16s]  There's zero thought.
[14506.16s -> 14512.12s]  Your thought when playing support is, do I get vision or not?
[14512.12s -> 14515.76s]  If no, where can I be the most useful?
[14515.76s -> 14522.97s]  Your thought should never be, this game's over, my team sucks.
[14522.97s -> 14528.49s]  It drives me ludicrous.
[14528.49s -> 14531.85s]  Like I'm sorry that I have to play support on this account to climb, but it's crazy
[14531.85s -> 14535.87s]  how dog shit AD carry is when you're solo queuing in Masters.
[14535.87s -> 14539.87s]  In GM, if it's a full GM game, AD Carry is easy as fuck.
[14539.87s -> 14544.87s]  If everybody has a brain activity and they're not idiots, AD Carry is amazing.
[14544.87s -> 14545.87s]  Favorite role in the game.
[14545.87s -> 14550.87s]  When you're playing with people who don't know what they're doing and you're actively trying to climb and improve,
[14550.87s -> 14554.87s]  it genuinely feels like I'm pulling out a ball hair with my tweezers.
[14554.87s -> 14556.87s]  Or pulling out my ball hairs with tweezers.
[14556.87s -> 14558.87s]  Like one by one.
[14558.87s -> 14564.55s]  It is so painful.
[14564.55s -> 14565.55s]  It's crazy.
[14565.55s -> 14571.70s]  Like let's take a look at this this support main right now
[14572.54s -> 14574.86s]  97 LP negative win rate, right? I
[14576.06s -> 14582.18s]  Could I could literally tell that he was not a good player in the first 30 seconds of that game
[14582.46s -> 14589.83s]  I'm sorry. I'm being mean but dude, this has been driving me crazy
[14590.59s -> 14600.32s]  Like look at the look at the support. I had last game. Also, can I ask a question? Why am I even allowed?
[14601.08s -> 14605.84s]  Why am I even allowed to be in games with a challenger?
[14605.84s -> 14621.02s]  I win the game, then immediately it puts me in a game with a 97 LP Master Support.
[14621.02s -> 14627.97s]  What is this matchmaking?
[14627.97s -> 14634.77s]  This is insane!
[14634.77s -> 14635.77s]  That's crazy!
[14635.77s -> 14667.39s]  I, I don't even, I'm wondering why, sorry I'm gonna go on a rant for a second, why
[14667.39s -> 14669.27s]  is this allowed?
[14669.27s -> 14673.39s]  Why can you be in a game, why can I be in a game with a literal guy who's about
[14673.39s -> 14680.51s]  promote to challenger right we win the game and then the very next game it puts me in a game with
[14680.51s -> 14705.07s]  a guy who's 97 lp this is insane sorry that's just frustrating as fuck because it's like such
[14705.07s -> 14719.66s]  bad game design right like that's that's 900 lp difference and the thing is this guy doesn't
[14719.66s -> 14725.54s]  have good MMR right like like it's not it's not like this guy has good MMR
[14725.54s -> 14732.08s]  right because look at his games he's playing with all masters players they're
[14732.08s -> 14738.26s]  all like 100 LP Masters 70 LP 30 LP right it doesn't make sense he it's not
[14738.26s -> 14744.50s]  like his MMR is high so why is this guy getting into like a 600 LP grand
[14744.50s -> 14749.00s]  master game why are we putting that guy in the game that's so
[14749.00s -> 14758.96s]  Frustrating. Sorry. I just I needed events. How do you know which ad carry to pick in each situation?
[14759.60s -> 14762.34s]  Uh, it's a lot of knowledge a lot of knowledge
[14764.32s -> 14766.32s]  Like you have to know
[14766.88s -> 14768.32s]  A lot of shit
[14768.32s -> 14774.00s]  Like what the enemy champions do what your champions need to do to to win the game what the win cons are
[14775.20s -> 14777.04s]  You can just pick
[14777.04s -> 14779.04s]  Everyone being honest though. You could just pick uh
[14781.44s -> 14785.68s]  Like there are ad carries in the current meta where you can just pick that are blinds like I was making a tier list
[14785.68s -> 14789.64s]  I forgot about it, but I mean you can blind pick Jinx pretty much every game
[14790.96s -> 14795.10s]  Like Jinx is just blindable every game pretty much. She's insane. She's super OP
[14795.88s -> 14799.16s]  So like if you if you ever just want to play a champion and you think like, okay
[14799.16s -> 14801.54s]  I want to practice AD like Jinx is insane super good
[14805.47s -> 14810.89s]  Draven's not blindable, but I do think he's really good if you're good at the game Draven's very good
[14811.87s -> 14815.45s]  He's he's he's harder than Jinx by a mile like Draven's a lot harder
[14815.45s -> 14821.82s]  but he's definitely like good at carrying with a lead as well.
[14821.82s -> 14824.82s]  Like another blindable AD that I think is like A tier is like Varus.
[14824.82s -> 14829.82s]  You can blind pick Varus really easily because Varus doesn't really have counters.
[14829.82s -> 14832.82s]  Like he doesn't get countered by anything.
[14832.82s -> 14838.82s]  He's more of like a, you can pick him and then go even and your ulti will always be useful.
[14838.82s -> 14843.82s]  You can look to like win lane, you can look to like engage, things like that, right?
[14843.82s -> 14872.79s]  Okay, so this game as the support I need to be tracking the jungler
[14874.69s -> 14876.69s]  So I'm gonna think where
[14876.89s -> 14880.43s]  Always be thinking what the enemy jungler wants to accomplish and how to stop it
[14880.43s -> 14883.01s]  That's like a pretty big tip of advice that I can give you guys
[14884.85s -> 14889.61s]  Like think to yourself like okay if I was the enemy jungler, what would I be wanting to do against the scrams right as Lisa?
[14891.05s -> 14894.73s]  He's probably gonna want to either gank early like gank bot early or he wants to
[14894.73s -> 14899.73s]  to invade on certain timers, right?
[14899.73s -> 14901.63s]  Because that's like what Lee is really good at,
[14901.63s -> 14902.83s]  is ganking and invading.
[14902.83s -> 14907.83s]  So what I think I'm gonna try to do this game
[14908.27s -> 14911.75s]  is I'm gonna try and watch for early ganks
[14911.75s -> 14913.15s]  and early pressure bot lane,
[14913.15s -> 14915.55s]  like your level two, level three ganks.
[14915.55s -> 14916.67s]  We're still gonna be aggressive,
[14916.67s -> 14918.51s]  but Lux took TP,
[14918.51s -> 14920.15s]  which means this Lux does not plan
[14920.15s -> 14922.27s]  on playing aggressive at all.
[14922.27s -> 14924.63s]  Like she basically, if anybody takes TP like this
[14924.63s -> 14930.23s]  lane I already know from start of the game that they're not planning on doing anything so I'm
[14930.23s -> 14934.47s]  probably gonna end up roaming a lot this game this is it's gonna be a game where I roam a ton
[14948.58s -> 14952.42s]  uh we do have some good lanes to roam to too like roaming top and mid is both really good
[14964.80s -> 14970.18s]  I just want her to ward early because uh I don't want to get shit on by Lee
[14971.70s -> 14978.02s]  so okay I'm just gonna flash immediately there's no reason to not flash there because
[14978.02s -> 14984.70s]  Alistar used this flash to get my flash, which is totally fine. It's better for him because he has hex flash, but
[14985.22s -> 14990.56s]  It's not that bad
[14990.56s -> 14993.72s]  Because I can out range him and I can stay away from his
[14994.44s -> 14999.20s]  His shit so we know he's in the bush. We just chill
[15000.16s -> 15002.76s]  There it is. He fucked up now we go forward. I
[15004.24s -> 15008.24s]  Don't know why Lux isn't throwing spells at this guy like I don't know why she didn't cue him
[15009.36s -> 15011.64s]  Like he fucked up the Alistar should have died there
[15011.64s -> 15015.20s]  And she's pinging me, okay.
[15015.20s -> 15016.38s]  The Alistar should have died there.
[15016.38s -> 15020.46s]  If Alistar ever fucks up an engage like that, where he hex flashes in, gets stuck, like
[15020.46s -> 15023.80s]  Q is cooldown, I don't know why it was thrown is what I'm saying.
[15023.80s -> 15029.88s]  You don't throw spells that aren't gonna land.
[15029.88s -> 15033.64s]  So there's no point in Lux ever throwing her Q until Alistar fucks up the combo.
[15033.64s -> 15039.08s]  Like she should just poke with E. And then, because it's almost like a Blitzhuk, right?
[15039.08s -> 15040.64s]  Think of it like a Blitzhuk.
[15040.64s -> 15045.26s]  she throws the the Q out right now they have an opportunity to be aggressive
[15045.26s -> 15050.52s]  because they know the hook they know the hook is down so it's better for her to
[15050.52s -> 15056.16s]  just hold the hook essentially right hold the Q and now when Alistar does
[15056.16s -> 15060.92s]  go in they have to be nervous about that Q because they can't just think oh
[15060.92s -> 15064.00s]  the Q's down let's let's engage right so they can't actually think about
[15064.00s -> 15073.83s]  that this is why I don't like a lot of the time doing this like push push the
[15073.83s -> 15080.93s]  wave they can't engage on us without like flashing so it doesn't matter like
[15080.93s -> 15092.19s]  look did she cue the wave again or am I an idiot like just oh man I'm losing my
[15092.19s -> 15097.69s]  mind here oh these I'm tilting it's fine I need to not tilt I need to just
[15097.69s -> 15102.19s]  chill but I'm getting frustrated because we're like not using cooldowns
[15102.19s -> 15104.19s]  Properly and it's driving me fucking crazy
[15107.54s -> 15111.30s]  Because these are very simple things to do you guys got to walk the way then by the way
[15111.30s -> 15114.38s]  You can't let them freeze. Okay, they're very simple things to do
[15114.38s -> 15116.26s]  I know I'm being annoying as shit whining about this
[15116.26s -> 15119.46s]  But this is stuff that you you need to be thinking about when you're playing the game
[15119.74s -> 15121.74s]  Well, you should actively be thinking
[15123.94s -> 15128.66s]  What can I do with my champions toolkit to stop their champions toolkit and
[15129.18s -> 15131.74s]  You should be thinking. Okay, I have Q right?
[15131.74s -> 15138.10s]  So what do they want to do? They want to go in okay, and when you're thinking they want to go in
[15138.62s -> 15146.64s]  Right you should be thinking okay when they go in I can just queue and that should be your entire thought process
[15147.48s -> 15149.48s]  Your thought process should never be oh
[15150.82s -> 15158.76s]  Maybe I can land a random queue at max range and we can get a kill she queued the wave. Yes. That's what I mean like
[15159.60s -> 15163.54s]  You should never queue the wave on Luxe either unless you're going to a hundred percent reset
[15163.54s -> 15171.48s]  That would be like if I hooked the wave as like Blitzcrank or some shit. Why is my Lux bait pinging my Graves?
[15172.16s -> 15175.66s]  Dude, I gotta keep this a hundred percent honest with you, man
[15177.44s -> 15179.20s]  You don't get
[15179.20s -> 15181.20s]  You you don't get to be mad here
[15181.84s -> 15183.98s]  Why are these players are such babies?
[15187.62s -> 15196.05s]  Jesus Christ what pussies man. These people are such babies. The Graves played correctly by the way like a hundred percent
[15197.41s -> 15199.47s]  He's mad at the Graves for taking a wave
[15199.97s -> 15202.93s]  He wanted to not like he wanted to be able to tp back and get the wave
[15203.41s -> 15211.01s]  That's what this lux is. So trash that she actually believes that the graves faults that graves misplayed by pushing the bot wave
[15211.73s -> 15213.73s]  But it was the right play
[15214.37s -> 15217.81s]  Pushing the bot wave was the correct play there because then she doesn't have to tp
[15218.29s -> 15220.61s]  The whole reason that he's pushing it is to save her teleport
[15221.33s -> 15223.33s]  So that she doesn't have to tp to lane
[15227.52s -> 15230.96s]  Players like this are why the game is hard to play right now in the current meta
[15231.60s -> 15233.20s]  Why it feels bad?
[15233.20s -> 15238.20s]  Because this Lux is trash everybody you guys can all see this Lux is terrible. She's already made a bunch of mistakes
[15238.20s -> 15240.76s]  She's blaming her team. She's being a dipshit, right?
[15241.44s -> 15243.44s]  but
[15243.88s -> 15246.32s]  She can climb up to this elo being this bad
[15249.65s -> 15251.71s]  Because of the system the current system in place
[15252.29s -> 15275.29s]  We should immediately do Baron here dragon. I mean we should do this come
[15276.31s -> 15278.31s]  You don't have time for this. Just come do dragon
[15279.69s -> 15288.31s]  Bro the Lee Sin just showed top we should be doing dragon when
[15297.22s -> 15302.82s]  When this shit happens, by the way, where you have enemy jungler shows on one side of the map,
[15302.82s -> 15307.22s]  you should always be playing on the other side of the map to make a counterplay.
[15308.22s -> 15313.22s]  So, jungler shows on top side, we go for dragon. Right? Easy.
[15313.22s -> 15321.34s]  Yo, be careful. Alistar's going to be there, Xerath's going to be there. Just leave.
[15321.34s -> 15323.34s]  Just leave. Leave of leave.
[15323.34s -> 15329.86s]  I'll do it for you. I'll make you leave. I got you, man.
[15329.86s -> 15332.86s]  But we had a timer just now, where their bot lane had to back,
[15332.86s -> 15342.86s]  And I need to back now, but we had timers now where their bot lane had to back and not only do their bot lane have to back but the enemy was top.
[15342.86s -> 15350.82s]  I tried man I tried to flash Q him.
[15350.82s -> 15359.74s]  But yeah, it's it's really I don't know a lot of junglers don't I don't think they know what they're on dead by the way.
[15359.74s -> 15361.74s]  I'm not even going to pop exhaust.
[15361.74s -> 15363.74s]  I'm just dead.
[15363.74s -> 15370.08s]  A lot of junglers don't know what the goal of the game actually is a lot of them think it's think that was a bad
[15370.08s -> 15374.62s]  Insect but a lot of junglers think the goal of the game is to like get as much farm as you can and run over
[15374.62s -> 15378.50s]  The enemy team and shit, but it's actually it is but it's also about like
[15379.18s -> 15383.36s]  Getting early objectives and turning those small leads into big leads through objective control
[15383.96s -> 15389.54s]  Right. So like right now I want to rotate top rift is up
[15389.54s -> 15391.74s]  I know Lee sin is gonna be on top side of the map right now
[15391.74s -> 15397.18s]  I want to rotate top so that I can help my team by being in the top side of the map
[15397.34s -> 15399.34s]  Because that's where the next play is gonna be made
[15399.74s -> 15414.04s]  Well, the place made mid, but I mean I'm here so it's fine. Oh my god
[15414.04s -> 15420.74s]  I did not think the fucking
[15421.38s -> 15423.38s]  Lee sin would be there, too. Oh
[15424.42s -> 15425.46s]  Oops
[15425.46s -> 15435.06s]  This is rough. I don't really know how to how to play this because I got there in time to counter the gank
[15435.06s -> 15441.22s]  right? I exhausted the guy, saved the Xerath. I got there in time to counter the gank, but
[15444.04s -> 15455.13s]  oh well played. That was actually mega well played. That was really good. I want to push
[15455.13s -> 15468.82s]  this wave in, but I can't. Like you guys are noticing there's no objectives taken on the map
[15468.82s -> 15473.78s]  yet at 10 minutes, which is kind of crazy. The ally's doing really good. The ally's just not
[15473.78s -> 15495.18s]  a bad support player. He's playing well. Like he's playing very well. A lot of this is more of like
[15495.18s -> 15500.38s]  I need I don't have anything to do on the map because uh I'm trying to help my jungler but my
[15500.38s -> 15506.70s]  jungler is trolling. It's really rough because like I'm trying to rotate over and help my
[15506.70s -> 15511.34s]  jungler on cooldown basically right but my jungler doesn't want to fight. You see like
[15511.34s -> 15526.54s]  like I'm countering the Alistar's fight or ganks it's just... I'm just dead. Dude.
[15526.54s -> 15530.98s]  Like we shouldn't have made that play mid because we knew that they were all
[15530.98s -> 15536.14s]  there and we knew that our jungler is doing this. This might just be a jungle
[15536.14s -> 15541.26s]  diff honestly. Like our AD carry sucks but it might just be a straight-up jungle
[15541.26s -> 15546.46s]  diff game. They do happen. Especially in this elo where jungle has so much
[15546.46s -> 15554.92s]  control of the game they do happen it's a pretty big jungle diff chip hoppy you
[15554.92s -> 15560.28s]  know it I know it but yeah he's saying yeah like he knows the jungle is getting
[15560.28s -> 15568.43s]  out out classed insanely hard because Graves counters Lee Sin it's a massive
[15568.43s -> 15576.53s]  counter but this guy doesn't know what he's doing I think he's a Rengar
[15576.53s -> 15581.63s]  one trick and Rengar got banned I think that's what's going on it's a
[15581.63s -> 15584.97s]  Rengar one trick who got banned out and he tried to play a champion that
[15584.97s -> 15591.01s]  requires thought not just a I jump you die champ right and he just gets shit on
[15591.01s -> 15601.32s]  for it I mean dude I can't even I can't even do anything this game our top
[15601.32s -> 15609.19s]  lenders getting his ass whipped too it's really fucking rough I mean he's
[15609.19s -> 15614.79s]  in here I'm pretty sure it's not it was just it was warded though I mean
[15614.79s -> 15620.75s]  we can't really do anything here I'm dead I think yeah I'm just dead this
[15620.75s -> 15626.59s]  is just rough. I kind of want to go next because I don't think I don't think we have the skill on
[15626.59s -> 15633.63s]  the team to win. The jungle diff is huge. The 80 diff is huge. And I'm just I can't I can't
[15633.63s -> 15650.74s]  impact the map. Like I can't I just can't do anything this game to impact the map and it
[15650.74s -> 15668.82s]  feels really bad. Oh, son of a bitch. I should have flashed. I got like creep blocked a little
[15668.82s -> 15671.30s]  bit when he knocked me and I like had to walk through I should just flashed up. That's
[15671.30s -> 15673.82s]  That's my man. Like, what was that TP, man?
[15673.98s -> 15675.58s]  Oh, God, get me out.
[15676.46s -> 15678.18s]  I'm going to be 100% real. Get me out.
[15678.18s -> 15680.50s]  That TP was miserably bad.
[15680.50s -> 15691.04s]  Dude, just TP'd to the wave.
[15691.04s -> 15692.44s]  Like, what is our Lux doing, too?
[15692.44s -> 15696.24s]  Like, I just feel like everybody's late to the fights.
[15697.84s -> 15700.40s]  Lux is always late to the fights.
[15700.40s -> 15702.28s]  The Graves doesn't want to take fights,
[15702.28s -> 15704.96s]  even though he's playing Graves and Elise in.
[15704.96s -> 15707.04s]  Like, I feel like, oh, this is rough.
[15707.04s -> 15708.60s]  This is a rough game.
[15708.88s -> 15711.82s]  Games like this tilt me and I kinda just wanna go next.
[15711.82s -> 15713.82s]  Cause games like this, they are winnable,
[15713.82s -> 15717.06s]  but I feel like I wanna go next to save mental, you know?
[15717.06s -> 15729.24s]  Like low key, I just wanna save my mental.
[15729.24s -> 15731.42s]  Cause the, oh, that's so gross.
[15732.76s -> 15735.00s]  Like watching what Lux did in the early stages
[15735.00s -> 15737.40s]  of the lane phase, just wasting her Q on repeat,
[15737.40s -> 15739.48s]  that was one of the most embarrassing things ever.
[15739.48s -> 15742.08s]  And then, like, look at that, she just Q'd a minion.
[15753.60s -> 15759.45s]  Ooh, bro, like, oh my God.
[15759.45s -> 15760.89s]  You gotta push the wave, man.
[15760.93s -> 15777.24s]  Holy shits. I mean I can't even walk. Oh my god. I
[15779.02s -> 15784.02s]  Don't even have help from my fucking team that's the worst part about this
[15788.38s -> 15791.62s]  Dude these games feel so unplayable man
[15793.50s -> 15797.16s]  Like I don't know how else to say it except for they just feel miserable to play
[15797.16s -> 15806.04s]  Like I'm trying to focus on playing like improving myself, but it's so hard to know how to improve in games where like
[15807.94s -> 15809.94s]  You genuinely just
[15810.08s -> 15811.84s]  Get no help
[15811.84s -> 15824.13s]  My locks has been tilted since like minute two for some reason and my graves has been completely pathing wrong doing wrong shit
[15824.65s -> 15827.05s]  It's hard to know how to help like I went mid to help
[15827.53s -> 15829.53s]  countered two of the early ganks
[15829.61s -> 15831.61s]  Lux still griefed the game
[15831.61s -> 15836.42s]  So like yeah, it's just it's hard to know and then top lane lost
[15837.26s -> 15841.66s]  It's so rough, man
[15845.81s -> 15851.69s]  Like I'm gonna keep it a hundred percent honest with you. If you are a one trick do not try and play other champs
[15853.13s -> 15854.81s]  You you will int
[15854.81s -> 15864.54s]  You will play badly always and you will int and you will you will complete like look at this. This is
[15865.52s -> 15868.84s]  2.9 K damage as a dude like what are we doing?
[15869.72s -> 15875.44s]  How are these people getting into this elo?
[15875.44s -> 15884.08s]  How does this locks like in the game she was against an alistar bot and she did one point
[15885.08s -> 15890.40s]  2.9 K damage in a 16 minute game against a melee heavy team
[15891.76s -> 15893.76s]  Like what is this what is happening?
[15894.88s -> 15896.88s]  This guy was d4
[15896.96s -> 15903.11s]  30 LP last season and now he's magically in Masters
[15907.89s -> 15909.89s]  No, we need to fix matchmaking
[15910.17s -> 15912.17s]  This is this is insane
[15912.17s -> 15919.36s]  Like this is just a matchmaking diff. It's nothing else
[15920.40s -> 15922.32s]  my man literally
[15922.32s -> 15928.88s]  Does not belong in master tier 400 LP MMR at all. Well, you can see that he's not at this level
[15929.40s -> 15946.30s]  Dude, I have the Lux player on my team again. Oh
[15949.71s -> 15962.83s]  This is Zareth one trick and a Rengar one trick on the enemy team. I don't know man. I
[15963.55s -> 15984.75s]  Guess I care more about the Rengar than the Zareth, but this is rough. Oh, what's up Chipoppy, dude
[15984.83s -> 15989.11s]  Sorry, I hit yes on that man. I know the game was winnable. I'm gonna be real, but dude
[15989.11s -> 15992.29s]  You didn't see what I saw during the early game of that game, Chibabi
[15992.83s -> 15998.72s]  like man the entire early game of that game was like
[15999.32s -> 16001.32s]  We lost lane
[16001.38s -> 16007.74s]  Because Lux wouldn't use her Q to fight the Alistar. She was using it to farm minions
[16008.98s -> 16012.74s]  Like she was so scared of being engaged on by the Alistar and the Kalista
[16012.74s -> 16019.14s]  that she would use her Q to max range farm minions instead of save it so when
[16019.14s -> 16024.26s]  the Alistar engages we just kill him right because if Alistar ever engages on
[16024.26s -> 16028.50s]  me in Lux he just gets killed we just bind him walk away and he's stuck there
[16028.50s -> 16035.22s]  and he dies right but for some reason she didn't understand how to do that
[16035.22s -> 16038.46s]  so she was just throwing it to farm so we would just get engaged on so I
[16038.46s -> 16041.82s]  started roaming and every time I was like roaming to an objective or
[16041.82s -> 16047.38s]  The Graves would always walk away and not fight. Like he wasn't attempting to fight
[16047.38s -> 16049.62s]  He was basically just like oh, I'm gonna go farm some more
[16049.62s -> 16053.50s]  But I'm like dude, you can't do that like if the Alistar is ganking mid and I'm countering mid
[16053.50s -> 16058.22s]  You can't just farm farm before coming mid or you can't just like not take dragon and showing that right like
[16058.50s -> 16064.20s]  It blows my mind that these players can get like it's like this guy too same thing like that jungler last game, right?
[16064.74s -> 16068.66s]  Look at this. It's the same thing as the last game like NA is riddled with this shit
[16068.66s -> 16074.56s]  It's it's so miserable to play. Look at this this jungler last game, right? He's not he's what like a d1 player, right?
[16074.56s -> 16077.96s]  He's not a bad player. He peeps d1. But why is this guy in this game now?
[16078.18s -> 16084.44s]  He like artificially inflated to this elo getting lucky with his first few games and now we have to play with this guy
[16084.44s -> 16093.21s]  Oh, it's an account share the person. It's a different player. Look on the account
[16094.97s -> 16096.57s]  D-flash f-flash
[16096.57s -> 16100.90s]  So, uh, it's a fucking account share
[16100.90s -> 16115.04s]  That's that's frustrating. Sorry for whining so much guys. This shit's just really frustrating to me
[16116.36s -> 16123.04s]  Like I know I should play it to like specifically only care about like improving and then while you're improving you'll climb automatically and shit
[16123.32s -> 16125.32s]  but it's really frustrating when like
[16127.04s -> 16131.30s]  The players in the game would rather be idiots and assholes to each other than play the game
[16131.52s -> 16137.12s]  Right like the game before the amumu right the game before this the amumu was just being toxic the whole game and into
[16137.12s -> 16145.12s]  the win away the last game the lux and the graves were being toxic to each other the whole game we entered the game away it's like i i
[16145.84s -> 16151.36s]  it's it's not fun to lose because one player gets mad at another player over them both being idiots
[16154.37s -> 16161.01s]  i'm sorry it's not fun it's so unfun but we'll try and we'll try and win this one
[16172.82s -> 16179.54s]  all we can really do is try and carry the games right it's about it what is
[16189.04s -> 16196.76s]  What what man what what do you think they're gonna do to me welcome to the league of yeah
[16196.76s -> 16202.06s]  I'll take it for the seven months man. Welcome back. I really don't want to meet all I don't I don't want to meet all
[16202.60s -> 16218.45s]  Because like I I want to like value the pings and shit, but dude if they walk up, I'm gonna flank them
[16219.07s -> 16221.07s]  That's why I'm standing here
[16253.18s -> 16278.23s]  That's a big cue. I need to get level two first here hundred percent. Ash should have just been autoing there that whole time
[16278.23s -> 16282.83s]  Because we have heal so she should have just walked up and autoed
[16283.15s -> 16289.91s]  As soon as this is what I mean by tracking cooldowns as soon as the Nico missed her as soon as the Nico missed her
[16289.91s -> 16295.67s]  Cooldown so she missed her e the ash should have just walked up and immediately started fighting
[16296.87s -> 16303.97s]  Right, like because they can no longer kill us the Nico doesn't actually have spells outside of her e
[16304.63s -> 16309.43s]  Right. So if she misses that snare and she used her W to right so it's like we just go ham
[16309.89s -> 16317.27s]  You don't need to be too scared. It happens quite a bit sometimes where people will just be like really nervous
[16335.06s -> 16338.68s]  Damn if I had dodged that Q. I actually would have killed all three
[16339.32s -> 16344.54s]  Damn, I don't know if it was worth the flash after the guy. I think it was if I had dodged the Q
[16344.54s -> 16346.16s]  I would have been fine
[16346.16s -> 16352.02s]  So that was that it's whatever. I also doesn't miss any creeps here. So it's not the end of the world
[16352.56s -> 16359.43s]  Like I'm pretty sure Lee sin did not have his top camps by the way
[16366.55s -> 16369.27s]  Damn if I was a little better mechanically, I turned that by the way
[16370.79s -> 16373.78s]  100%
[16373.78s -> 16400.28s]  We should push this wave so that I can go get vision because yeah that guy can't freeze that wave. So
[16403.34s -> 16416.15s]  Sounds too bad
[16416.15s -> 16417.51s]  recent top
[16417.51s -> 16426.65s]  You can kind of see some really good
[16427.69s -> 16432.75s]  What is this?
[16432.75s -> 16434.75s]  Why is my car this afk at turret?
[16435.15s -> 16440.96s]  What is happening right now?
[16440.96s -> 16467.16s]  Why was he afk? I mean, I guess it worked out
[16467.16s -> 16470.30s]  But yeah, maybe you had to go let his cat out and I don't know
[16472.60s -> 16481.76s]  Happens we do their ballings not very good
[16482.96s -> 16492.38s]  They're trying too hard to force fights that they can't win like they they genuinely can't win half these fights that they're trying to force
[16493.74s -> 16498.30s]  Maybe if they were against people who like don't push their buttons they could win those but it's like all I have to do
[16498.30s -> 16500.30s]  Is stand there and fight back and they lose
[16500.50s -> 16504.38s]  They're on dragon a thousand percent right now. There's not a lot I can do about that
[16504.38s -> 16505.88s]  that
[16505.88s -> 16512.26s]  We just have to chill there's almost nothing I can do about it kaisa is trying to fake act like she's big but it's
[16515.77s -> 16517.77s]  There's just nothing we can do
[16519.26s -> 16529.21s]  Cuz our car this is top. So we just chill they finished the cheerless. No, no, not yet
[16530.49s -> 16533.89s]  Whoa
[16533.89s -> 16535.89s]  Lisa could be bought right now
[16537.53s -> 16541.93s]  Mmm, I don't think it's too bad if he's bought though. They can't really dive us especially with card assaults
[16542.53s -> 16559.12s]  Why why does my ash just run?
[16560.20s -> 16567.76s]  She like just straight-up runs away. It's kind of silly
[16576.86s -> 16581.66s]  Because we have we have card this ulti like we can win at five e or we can win a fight bot right now
[16581.66s -> 16588.80s]  I guess I guess I'm just gonna have to get them low enough for Carthus to kill them
[16590.36s -> 16592.52s]  Like without the ashes help
[16593.66s -> 16595.66s]  Which I think I can do that's not too bad
[16597.55s -> 16599.55s]  Okay, the Akali's coming bought
[16600.43s -> 16602.43s]  We just killed him. I mean, let's just fight
[16610.90s -> 16612.90s]  I don't know why we should just ash arrow honestly
[16615.10s -> 16621.61s]  just ash arrow
[16621.61s -> 16623.61s]  Okay, that was pretty bad ash arrow, but
[16630.82s -> 16633.70s]  Filled uh, I don't think he's filled. I think he's just having a bad game
[16635.22s -> 16637.22s]  Like I think it happens, you know
[16637.86s -> 16642.78s]  Whoa, okay
[16642.78s -> 16644.78s]  Do it ult me. I fucking dare you
[16649.40s -> 16651.40s]  I'm trying to keep some mana
[16651.72s -> 16666.62s]  So that I can ulti
[16666.78s -> 16668.94s]  Oh carthus already used his ults. Fuck
[16675.50s -> 16677.50s]  They both backed there. Wow
[16678.26s -> 16684.22s]  My bad, I honestly didn't think they were both gonna back there
[16684.86s -> 16689.60s]  Like I thought the Kai'sa was gonna back right where I saw her like last
[16690.68s -> 16692.48s]  That was my bad
[16692.48s -> 16694.48s]  mmm, I should be I
[16694.84s -> 16696.84s]  Think Lee Sin can come bot here and kill me. I
[16699.82s -> 16701.82s]  Should actually stop this guy's back
[16706.55s -> 16712.41s]  Yeah, I should stop his back because it's more value to stop the back now. Even if Lee Sin isn't bot it's more value
[16713.59s -> 16715.59s]  Cuz he's so low
[16716.47s -> 16718.75s]  Kali is Mia though. So we gotta be care
[16719.27s -> 16723.35s]  I wasted my ult though, which makes me kind of scared
[16723.83s -> 16726.79s]  The other thing that kind of sucks about this is we don't have good vision
[16727.47s -> 16737.45s]  And I can't really help anybody on the map because the same thing is happening as before
[16738.57s -> 16746.88s]  We're like we're missing opportunities to get kills on timers. I mean the dog lightning guys playing fine this game
[16746.88s -> 16751.10s]  I think he's trolled a lot like he's he's trolling. This isn't like his best game
[16752.26s -> 16756.38s]  But it's also I don't know why we're getting so tilted around the map right now
[16756.38s -> 16759.94s]  Because if I'm being honest, we should just win the game off of like
[16761.46s -> 16781.17s]  Being better players. I don't know what this Karthus is thinking but do it do it do it
[16782.21s -> 16784.21s]  Karthus we can fight we can fight just fight
[16787.10s -> 16789.10s]  Bro, what are we doing?
[16790.38s -> 16794.72s]  I'm losing it man. Oh, no. No, I'm tilted. I'm tilted as fuck
[16794.72s -> 16799.02s]  He didn't walk in just go on to the Akali shroud, man. I
[16799.02s -> 16804.14s]  I just walk a foot to your right and stand on the Akali shroud
[16804.58s -> 16808.46s]  She just eats your damage like while she's in the shroud. She can't stop that
[16812.65s -> 16814.65s]  Holy shit, I'm losing my minds
[16816.62s -> 16820.78s]  Like ash is just inting bot bot waves right now not trying to do anything
[16822.18s -> 16826.70s]  Locks is really far up on CS, which is really good, but I'm losing it man
[16828.50s -> 16830.94s]  Like we see exactly where they are every game
[16830.94s -> 16837.04s]  Like we see where everybody is on the enemy team permanently, and we still can't manage to like walk to the right location
[16837.78s -> 16841.72s]  This is driving me crazy
[16841.72s -> 16843.72s]  my my car this
[16843.80s -> 16846.24s]  80 my car this jungle is getting out farmed
[16846.88s -> 16850.70s]  Like a car this jungle is getting out farmed by a Lee sin jungle. That's insane
[16851.64s -> 16854.60s]  Like I don't think I don't think I can stress enough how crazy that is
[16855.28s -> 16860.46s]  Well, you should never be a world where car this ever gets out farms
[16865.35s -> 16867.35s]  No way
[16867.35s -> 16874.99s]  I'm dead dude. No way. I just fucking ate the end of that now. I'm playing that just kill the Lee sin, man. I
[16884.46s -> 16886.46s]  fucked up there
[16886.94s -> 16890.80s]  That was my fault cuz I got hit by the tip of the that was my fault
[16890.80s -> 16894.42s]  I got barely clipped by the tip of the nicole's when I was trying to space cuz I'm bad
[16895.30s -> 16898.62s]  And if I was alive there and I could have saved my flash for the Lee sin Q
[16898.62s -> 16905.31s]  We just win I am confused that why we decided to like not fight that immediately though
[16906.27s -> 16911.51s]  Like we caught out two of their members and we just got scared for whatever reason wait, we win this fight
[16912.27s -> 16914.27s]  With thousand percent win this fight this fight this fight this
[16928.64s -> 16934.84s]  Bro, do not throw a fucking temper tantrum right now. There's one kill. Do not throw a temper tantrum. Oh
[16938.21s -> 16940.21s]  My god, here we go. I
[16940.49s -> 16943.09s]  Took one kill the guy's about to lose his mind guys. I
[16951.58s -> 16954.42s]  Need to mute all I'm gonna mute all in a second
[16955.70s -> 16958.10s]  Like I can't with these people right now
[16961.30s -> 16963.46s]  Like I can't man you people are disgusting
[16964.90s -> 16966.90s]  like you guys just
[16966.90s -> 16971.30s]  Wine you play bad you whine and you bitch about every little mistake that everything happens
[16971.70s -> 16975.14s]  Even though it's like in the middle of a fight. I guarantee i'm a better player than you are
[16975.54s -> 16978.58s]  and you're still whining and crying over one shutdown that like
[16979.30s -> 16984.02s]  You didn't even walk to until I spam pinged you like I literally one v2ed them you hit one e
[16984.66s -> 16988.29s]  And now you're mad
[16988.29s -> 16991.03s]  Dude, I swear league players are fucking psychopaths
[16991.67s -> 17002.17s]  At least I got the exhaust off surely she dies right surely she dies here or not. Okay
[17003.35s -> 17005.35s]  Okay, at least she died
[17005.97s -> 17007.97s]  Help each other guys
[17008.61s -> 17014.50s]  Help each other teamwork teamwork teamwork teamwork teamwork
[17019.49s -> 17021.49s]  Wait, this ash is insane
[17025.77s -> 17031.07s]  Okay, I'm not gonna lie that ash played that so good. I only saw the end of it and she still played that good
[17032.51s -> 17034.51s]  That was sick
[17034.79s -> 17048.00s]  Well done. That was actually really good. She almost stopped the dive. That's crazy.
[17048.00s -> 17054.58s]  This game is definitely 1000% still winnable though. We just have to play for late game
[17054.58s -> 17058.76s]  and not lose our fucking minds. I'll let that push back into my ash. I'll go mid and
[17058.76s -> 17065.84s]  get some vision. That's pretty much all we have to do. Play for late and not lose
[17065.84s -> 17074.92s]  our mind early. We could play to kill this Akali right now. She doesn't know.
[17074.92s -> 17077.28s]  There's no ward here.
[17077.28s -> 17078.68s]  We can also invade here.
[17078.68s -> 17084.79s]  Oh, that's so unlucky.
[17084.79s -> 17114.00s]  That was such a close Q. Kill that guy.
[17114.00s -> 17115.00s]  Jesus Christ.
[17115.00s -> 17122.23s]  I feel like we should have won that fight.
[17122.23s -> 17125.23s]  I feel like something awkward happened and we lost.
[17125.23s -> 17129.21s]  Did my Ashe just walk directly into the Sakali and not use her ulti?
[17129.21s -> 17130.21s]  Use your ulti.
[17130.21s -> 17131.21s]  You have ulti.
[17131.21s -> 17132.21s]  Use your ulti.
[17132.21s -> 17142.22s]  Oh my god.
[17142.22s -> 17143.22s]  What the fuck.
[17143.22s -> 17146.61s]  Oh my god.
[17146.61s -> 17148.61s]  I
[17148.85s -> 17152.49s]  Don't even know what to say right now. This is insane
[17154.21s -> 17159.29s]  This genuinely feels like everybody in the game is losing their mind in the freest game I've ever seen in my life
[17163.62s -> 17169.82s]  Like that's what we're losing to right there that guy the guy who like doesn't understand how Senna works
[17170.46s -> 17174.16s]  Like that player. That's why I'm frustrated like that player right there
[17175.06s -> 17177.06s]  Has no idea how Senna works
[17177.46s -> 17179.46s]  tries to fight me and
[17179.46s -> 17183.38s]  and we're like losing to that guy like i'm trying really hard not to be an
[17183.38s -> 17188.10s]  asshole but like it's flooding out right now from these games
[17188.10s -> 17194.76s]  it's crazy like he's so toxic look at this
[17194.76s -> 17202.20s]  he went proto belt ionia boot uh nico but like what that doesn't do
[17202.20s -> 17220.42s]  anything to help his team you could arrow that guy i mean it's
[17220.42s -> 17235.99s]  not impossible or don't that's fine
[17235.99s -> 17242.85s]  My god
[17242.85s -> 17245.07s]  Guys, I think my locks is afk
[17247.87s -> 17250.31s]  She's been sitting in base for like five minutes. I
[17256.43s -> 17258.43s]  think she's like
[17258.47s -> 17260.47s]  Literally just throwing there some fits
[17261.07s -> 17273.20s]  Let's push this wave
[17273.20s -> 17275.20s]  We could make a pick right now
[17280.20s -> 17283.32s]  Jax, what are you doing, man? Why are you up there? Oh, no
[17283.92s -> 17288.67s]  Also, why does this ash have the worst build I've ever seen?
[17295.68s -> 17298.68s]  Dude, if we lose to the Kaisa that just did that I'm gonna lose my mind
[17299.44s -> 17318.56s]  Like that guy just blind art in without any vision of anybody and just died
[17319.32s -> 17321.32s]  There's just no way we can lose this
[17321.60s -> 17326.26s]  We got this guys just play
[17326.58s -> 17332.17s]  like I just need to I need help getting vision control on Baron and
[17332.77s -> 17334.77s]  Mid and then we can we can win
[17335.25s -> 17336.81s]  We got this
[17336.81s -> 17418.73s]  Right now. I mean we still got Baron, but he did get two of them. I guess
[17419.25s -> 17423.08s]  Or no, we only yeah, you got card this in ash
[17424.44s -> 17434.89s]  But we did get Baron, which is very nice. So I'm gonna go Dom's this game
[17435.63s -> 17437.63s]  I'm gonna go
[17438.91s -> 17457.68s]  Black cleaver, but I think I'm gonna go Dom's I need to get vision control on dragon and min I
[17470.53s -> 17473.23s]  Need to get vision control and I need I need help to do it though
[17474.33s -> 17476.33s]  I'm gonna act like I'm backing here
[17476.93s -> 17486.34s]  We should just be pushing mid with Baron. I don't know what we're doing
[17488.06s -> 17491.28s]  Like like Loki it should just be straight up like we go mid with Baron here
[17492.10s -> 17504.69s]  The fuck was that that was a terrible play
[17505.59s -> 17536.06s]  Guys just just come mid we have Baron nice huge pick push mid push mid
[17537.34s -> 17552.60s]  Fuck dragon just push mid. Okay now we back off. Oh, I mean that was
[17553.92s -> 17555.08s]  Bad
[17555.08s -> 17562.20s]  Guys back off back off back off leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf, please. Please just leave
[17566.28s -> 17569.28s]  Guys, you can leave you can leave we just go to dragon leaf
[17570.04s -> 17575.92s]  We still have so much gold to get on the map. We can go get bot tier two
[17576.66s -> 17578.66s]  bot tier one bot tier two
[17579.08s -> 17581.68s]  We have we have so much gold to go on the map. It's not a big deal, right?
[17581.68s -> 17585.82s]  like we don't need to end the game right the seconds we actually have Karthus and we have
[17587.64s -> 17633.12s]  Jacks too. So like our scaling is really good. I need to go get I need to go get
[17634.32s -> 17636.56s]  My next item, but I need enough gold to do it. I
[17638.78s -> 17640.78s]  Also need to get wards
[17640.78s -> 17644.62s]  This sucks. I'm on like a weird by timer where like I don't have enough things to get
[17645.14s -> 17647.14s]  You know what? I'm just gonna get my ward item
[17647.14s -> 17651.10s]  I'm gonna grab this for right now just so we can actually get some power on the map
[17651.74s -> 17656.88s]  Cuz the map's so dark and I think getting the ward item before finishing my last whisper items probably the smartest call
[17657.42s -> 17666.56s]  I am a little concerned why we're not pushing bot with Jax. We're pushing top
[17668.28s -> 17674.28s]  And I'm also concerned why we're not playing for mid prio and we're just farming bot side
[17675.72s -> 17677.72s]  This is such an awkward fucking thing
[17678.60s -> 17686.86s]  Like we should just be playing for mid prio and use aero to engage
[17687.36s -> 17690.42s]  That's how we win. We just use aero to engage when they contest mid
[17691.24s -> 17693.16s]  It's actually that easy
[17693.16s -> 17701.34s]  Like low-key. It's actually that easy
[17701.82s -> 17718.71s]  See watch now this guy's dead. I mean, that's fine with me
[17720.19s -> 17722.39s]  You guys want to int to kill me that's totally fine
[17723.39s -> 17738.16s]  They can get the inhib and then they can back up
[17739.32s -> 17743.88s]  Yeah, yeah get in here back up and then play for play for Baron
[17743.88s -> 17751.24s]  They'll only have a few seconds to do this though, so it's kind of scary because these two are gonna be alive
[17752.44s -> 17759.21s]  They need to back immediately
[17759.67s -> 17765.97s]  Just reset you don't need the wave just leave leave leave
[17766.65s -> 17769.01s]  Barons up burns up think about the macro guys the macro
[17769.85s -> 17771.53s]  We play for Baron now
[17771.53s -> 17778.96s]  Because there's a timer now where like you guys just need to reset because there's a timer where the enemy has
[17779.24s -> 17781.36s]  Tempo on the map and if we don't
[17782.72s -> 17784.72s]  If we don't allow
[17784.72s -> 17788.72s]  If we don't reset, they'll just rush Baron and there's nothing we can do about it.
[17788.72s -> 17801.03s]  Okay, they're not on Baron. I think they missed their timer.
[17801.03s -> 17803.03s]  They're on it. No, they're on it. They're on it. They're on it.
[17803.03s -> 17806.72s]  Okay, they're not on it. We're fine.
[17806.72s -> 17815.13s]  We can still fight this, though, but we need everybody here.
[17815.13s -> 17823.56s]  Just arrow. Arrow, Ash. Arrow.
[17823.56s -> 17826.56s]  Arrow. Arrow. It doesn't matter if you hit Malph. Just arrow.
[17826.56s -> 17829.56s]  Just arrow him. Thank you.
[17829.56s -> 17837.84s]  No, no. Guys, the back line. The back line.
[17837.84s -> 17841.86s]  Play together. Play together.
[17841.86s -> 17854.01s]  Yes! Nice! End of the game. You end. You end here.
[17854.01s -> 17859.01s]  Lux, don't back. You are giving me cancer. Okay, they forfeit it.
[17859.01s -> 17864.01s]  Dude, look how easy that is. Look how easy it is to win games when people are listening to macro.
[17864.01s -> 17872.01s]  Look how easy it is. Oh my god! I'm losing it, man. I swear to god, I'm losing my hair.
[17872.01s -> 17876.01s]  I can feel my hair falling out right now. I can feel it falling out of my fucking head.
[17876.01s -> 17878.33s]  Like, I just lost one, it's right there, look.
[17878.33s -> 17878.97s]  Like, it's just...
[17880.25s -> 17881.45s]  Fucking kill me, man.
[17882.25s -> 17883.21s]  In game.
[17883.21s -> 17883.71s]  God.
[17884.65s -> 17885.85s]  It's so hard.
[17885.85s -> 17887.93s]  I feel so exhausted.
[17888.49s -> 17890.01s]  Like, it's so exhausting.
[17895.00s -> 17896.44s]  You played a 44 minute gold game?
[17896.44s -> 17897.56s]  God damn.
[17898.76s -> 17899.48s]  That's impressive.
[17903.44s -> 17905.04s]  I don't want to honor any of these people.
[17905.60s -> 17906.64s]  Who would you guys honor?
[17907.68s -> 17909.20s]  Like, out of all of them, who would you guys pick?
[17909.20s -> 17910.72s]  Because I don't know, they all suck.
[17910.72s -> 17912.72s]  In my eyes, I'm too toxic right now, they all suck.
[17916.16s -> 17927.92s]  Jax alright, I'll give it to Jax. Ash. Ash was trying. I'll give you that. Ash was trying. Dude, look at this Lux.
[17929.20s -> 17939.55s]  This Lux got so fucking carried. Oh my god.
[17941.15s -> 17950.99s]  Don't type to me you pedestrian. This man called him a pedestrian.
[17959.24s -> 17965.72s]  That's not even an insult. Like oh yeah. Yeah. Wow. Fucking pedestrian. Like
[17965.72s -> 17996.28s]  I feel like part of my life gets taken away, you know, like when I play on my main account
[17996.28s -> 17998.32s]  and I'm like super sweaty try harding and shit.
[17998.32s -> 18002.20s]  I feel like I feel like I'm losing like yeah, it's like it's like every time I lose it's
[18002.20s -> 18005.60s]  like one hair or like every time I'm like barely win, right?
[18005.60s -> 18009.76s]  It's just like every game in this ELO is like one hair on my head gets fucking burnt
[18009.76s -> 18032.63s]  out and it just leaves and I'm not like I'm gonna be looking like Homer Simpson
[18032.63s -> 18035.07s]  Like, look at the difference in wards placed.
[18035.07s -> 18038.55s]  This is what annoys me about bad support players.
[18038.55s -> 18039.95s]  This guy placed 23.
[18041.35s -> 18043.93s]  He's more focused on getting kills than placing wards,
[18043.93s -> 18051.16s]  and it's really stupid.
[18051.16s -> 18052.40s]  Sorry, I just don't, like I said,
[18052.40s -> 18054.18s]  I don't have anything against the dog lightning guy
[18054.18s -> 18056.08s]  as a person, other than like,
[18056.08s -> 18058.44s]  what I've seen on his stream, right?
[18058.44s -> 18062.10s]  Like on his stream, he just seems really egotistical.
[18063.20s -> 18065.02s]  Like he's like everything I hate
[18065.02s -> 18066.82s]  in the average league player.
[18066.82s -> 18073.82s]  He has a massive ego because he reached Challenger on the support role on like an off meta pick
[18073.82s -> 18076.90s]  like last year at some point or something or maybe he's Challenger right now, I don't
[18076.90s -> 18078.14s]  even know.
[18078.14s -> 18080.80s]  Maybe he has an account in Challenger, I don't even know.
[18080.80s -> 18087.92s]  But it drives me crazy because like he doesn't do anything correctly, like he gets away
[18087.92s -> 18095.22s]  with such dumb shit because he like basically wins lane because he plays extremely aggressively.
[18095.22s -> 18099.22s]  But if you guys noticed in that game, the reason we won lane or we were able to push
[18099.22s -> 18104.68s]  back is because they played aggressively, but they did it really stupidly.
[18104.68s -> 18107.54s]  Like they were fighting us in our own waves, right?
[18107.54s -> 18110.38s]  Like on repeat, they were just fighting us in our own waves.
[18110.38s -> 18114.50s]  Every time I would just turn a one for one, almost a one for two every time.
[18114.50s -> 18117.62s]  And it's stupid because every time that's happening, they're also giving me souls,
[18117.62s -> 18118.62s]  right?
[18118.62s -> 18121.54s]  And he would like take weird fights and like, I know he's probably for fun and
[18121.54s -> 18122.54s]  he doesn't care.
[18122.54s -> 18123.88s]  It's a smurf, blah, blah, blah.
[18123.88s -> 18129.92s]  But I just don't like when people like that like ego their ass off when they play so badly.
[18129.92s -> 18130.92s]  It drives me crazy.
[18130.92s -> 18136.33s]  Why do I care so much?
[18136.33s -> 18138.01s]  I don't know.
[18138.01s -> 18159.52s]  I don't know.
[18159.52s -> 18161.64s]  How you guys doing by the way?
[18161.64s -> 18163.16s]  How's everybody's day going in chat?
[18163.16s -> 18164.16s]  What you guys up to?
[18164.16s -> 18165.24s]  Talk to me.
[18165.24s -> 18168.76s]  I know I stopped like teaching the game and started whining like I got on my main
[18168.76s -> 18172.20s]  account a few hours ago and I stopped teaching and I started whining a bunch.
[18172.20s -> 18178.55s]  So my bad.
[18178.55s -> 18180.43s]  My bad on that one dudes.
[18180.43s -> 18181.43s]  How you guys doing now?
[18181.43s -> 18189.62s]  How's everybody's day gone?
[18189.62s -> 18191.02s]  When the coaching service is open?
[18191.02s -> 18195.26s]  Oh, I could probably do coaching at some point soon.
[18196.18s -> 18198.42s]  Like I'd be willing to do some coaching,
[18198.42s -> 18199.72s]  some like sub coaching or something,
[18199.72s -> 18201.50s]  or like something like that.
[18201.50s -> 18211.96s]  It might be fun.
[18211.96s -> 18212.80s]  Sucking in bronze,
[18212.80s -> 18213.96s]  you don't get enough time to actually improve.
[18213.96s -> 18214.92s]  Dude, I feel that, man.
[18214.92s -> 18216.12s]  It takes a long time.
[18216.12s -> 18218.40s]  League is not an easy game to pick up
[18218.40s -> 18219.96s]  and start playing, right?
[18219.96s -> 18221.84s]  Like if you're in bronze or silver and you're like,
[18221.84s -> 18223.66s]  oh, I actually, you know, I'm having fun playing the game.
[18223.66s -> 18225.28s]  I kind of want to try and get better.
[18225.28s -> 18227.28s]  It's, you're just overwhelmed with so much info
[18227.28s -> 18236.67s]  you like have to play so many games right like i i feel you man like it's it's overwhelming
[18245.60s -> 18263.84s]  yeah i i feel you well we got mid okay uh should i just play tryst well i'm worried if i pick
[18263.84s -> 18270.64s]  tryst that we won't have ap but i also think i'm better at tryst than i am at like other stuff
[18270.64s -> 18281.65s]  I don't know, AP Varus?
[18281.65s -> 18287.82s]  I am not good enough at AP Varus man, I'm gonna be real.
[18287.82s -> 18291.66s]  Well my Malz is good, but the problem with Malz is like, Malz is a shitty champion.
[18291.66s -> 18298.32s]  Like Malz is trash right, so like, he's good but he's like not good in the sense
[18298.32s -> 18302.82s]  of like, I can play him well, but at the end of the day if they pick something
[18302.82s -> 18306.10s]  that like, counters Malz, I just lose.
[18338.24s -> 18343.67s]  justbasked
[18343.67s -> 18349.47s]  justbasked
[18349.47s -> 18357.47s]  justbasked
[18382.61s -> 18388.45s]  get to iron four right they like they like into down to iron four or whatever to see if they could make it and
[18390.85s -> 18398.85s]  uh there's just so many like smurfs in iron there's like legitimate bot bot accounts
[18400.69s -> 18405.49s]  like like accounts that are like being bodied right there's like bot of the counts in iron
[18405.49s -> 18418.40s]  there's like smurfs all over the place it seems to have stopped i wonder if riot like
[18418.40s -> 18420.40s]  Did something that stopped the bots?
[18421.68s -> 18425.60s]  They must they may have like they may have just incorporated something that like stops the software
[18429.68s -> 18432.32s]  But I don't know. I haven't heard anything about it, but
[18433.12s -> 18434.64s]  I have no clue
[18434.64s -> 18459.91s]  I'll be real. I don't know
[18459.91s -> 18461.91s]  You had a trick follow you around last game. I got boots one
[18463.75s -> 18472.71s]  Dude that sounds awful. I kind of feel bad for actual iron players who are like
[18474.47s -> 18476.55s]  In iron trying to climb because like
[18476.55s -> 18496.92s]  I do think you can climb out of any elo, it doesn't matter, if I were to go into an iron
[18496.92s -> 18504.48s]  game, I'd probably drop like 50 kills, so I do think you can climb out of any elo, for
[18504.48s -> 18519.72s]  sure.
[18519.72s -> 18523.40s]  You'll have a new account, if you had a bot account that answered every time I wrote
[18523.40s -> 18527.44s]  bot.
[18527.44s -> 18528.44s]  That's funny.
[18528.44s -> 18543.93s]  Yeah, I assume that's a good point, I guess if you're in iron, you could play to
[18543.93s -> 18546.89s]  learn the game a bit better, and then you could play a new account and see where you
[18546.89s -> 18560.22s]  got. Yeah, no, that would work. That makes sense. Sure. I'll first pick men. I'll first pick Senna.
[18563.00s -> 18569.48s]  I guarantee they lock in fucking these people are gonna lock in fucking Nautilus or some shits.
[18570.76s -> 18584.84s]  It'll be like Jarvan, Nautilus. I don't even know. Ribbon's not too bad for Senna. It's okay.
[18584.84s -> 18588.20s]  It's okay to get flanks. I actually don't think Ribbon's too bad right now. Maybe all
[18588.20s -> 18591.28s]  All the ribbon players I've played against suck, but I don't think she's actually that bad
[18591.28s -> 18597.72s]  I think ribbons like just you have to position well, I think ribbons really broken at abusing positioning
[18598.32s -> 18606.16s]  That's why she's so good. It's all like you like good ribbon players. I'll get really gross flanks and the flanks are what's op
[18606.16s -> 18609.16s]  Yeah, there's the gragas. Okay. I was like they're gonna pick something to fuck me over
[18609.76s -> 18614.88s]  This guy picked ragas, but it was gonna be like j4 or gragas or something
[18615.70s -> 18618.34s]  And then this guy is the support. He'll probably pick Nautilus
[18618.34s -> 18624.92s]  Unless he's a one trick right like unless this guy's straight up just like a one trick
[18624.92s -> 18631.22s]  He'll pick like Nautilus or some shits. Maybe Rakan Rakan or Nautilus
[18631.86s -> 18642.83s]  Because if he picks an enchanter, we just win the game. He has to pick engage
[18647.32s -> 18649.44s]  Melio would be really good here, too, actually
[18650.76s -> 18656.64s]  Because Melio would counter half our team you can Melio Q Wukong and Kennen engage
[18656.64s -> 18663.66s]  Like, if this guy played Nileo, this would actually be a hard lane.
[18663.66s -> 18664.66s]  Tom Kinch?
[18664.66s -> 18670.25s]  I mean, I get it.
[18670.25s -> 18672.01s]  But I think it's bad.
[18672.01s -> 18673.01s]  Runes?
[18673.01s -> 18674.81s]  Oh, shit.
[18674.81s -> 18679.65s]  Yo, you just saved me looking like an absolute fool.
[18679.65s -> 18680.65s]  Thank you.
[18680.65s -> 18682.65s]  Holy crap.
[18682.65s -> 18684.69s]  If you wanted to see my runes, they're here, but thank you, you reminded me.
[18684.69s -> 18685.69s]  Here, I'm gonna be over here, I'm gonna get some water.
[18685.69s -> 18686.69s]  I'll be right back.
[18686.69s -> 18687.69s]  Get some aqua.
[18687.69s -> 18730.83s]  get some aqua by the way the people who are here to watch me play ad carry
[18732.27s -> 18738.83s]  i sincerely apologize i know watching me play senna is probably boring as fuck
[18742.32s -> 18749.28s]  okay i know and i promise you we will play ad carry at some point i promise you
[18750.00s -> 18753.12s]  i played like the first four hours of the stream was ad carry or the first three
[18753.68s -> 18756.48s]  right i played on my smurf for a few games and played some ad so if you want to watch
[18756.48s -> 18762.48s]  that you can go back in the bod we did some my commentary and shit uh the only reason i'm playing
[18763.12s -> 18768.48s]  so much senna and support on this account is because like there the elo i'm currently in is
[18768.48s -> 18775.68s]  like the worst elo to climb in solo queue because of a lot of factors and support has some of the
[18775.68s -> 18782.84s]  highest impact on the game whereas like ad carry has high impact late but in in solo queue you
[18782.84s -> 18785.64s]  You want to have high impact early and I wanted to be able to
[18786.68s -> 18822.52s]  Impact the game really early on so yeah, sorry about being you know boring and shit. I just really want to like win games
[18824.08s -> 18825.36s]  At least on this accounts
[18825.36s -> 18830.04s]  I want to get out of the seal Oh cuz the faster I get out of the seal Oh the the faster
[18830.64s -> 18843.62s]  The faster I get out of the seal. Oh the faster I can
[18845.08s -> 18847.48s]  Have fun playing 80 carry and like trying climb
[18849.28s -> 18851.28s]  What a weird
[18851.28s -> 18856.20s]  Like what a weird play by these guys. What the fuck they like half shoved the waves
[18856.96s -> 18873.99s]  To get like early bush control and then they did shit like that. This guy's just dead. I'm gonna give it to twitch
[18878.26s -> 18884.42s]  Nice, we got his exhausts. So I wasted my exhaust there. I did it because I thought the jinx was gonna insta flash
[18886.38s -> 18890.84s]  Like I didn't exhaust because I was like scared of her damage I did it because I thought she was gonna like
[18891.10s -> 18893.10s]  try and flash away the second that's
[18893.10s -> 18899.10s]  But I landed my snare, it was kind of bad by me, I mean I landed my snare so I didn't
[18899.10s -> 18902.16s]  need to exhaust her, I just was like oh maybe she'll flash.
[18902.16s -> 18903.92s]  She did not, she did not flash.
[18903.92s -> 18906.20s]  What do you know is this?
[18906.20s -> 18909.44s]  This is 500 LP masters, 400 LP.
[18909.44s -> 18913.04s]  It's insane, I know.
[18913.04s -> 18935.51s]  Absolutely crazy.
[18935.51s -> 18940.19s]  Put that ward there because Gragas is probably bot, yeah.
[18940.19s -> 18951.24s]  So they're trying to come up from bot to kill me here.
[18951.24s -> 18955.08s]  Like their bot lane is rotating up to try and kill me
[18956.40s -> 18961.28s]  So just be careful twitch they're they're in here man. I
[18962.52s -> 18976.34s]  Actually have to back and walk look. This is hilarious. The enemy bot lane literally is roaming mid. Look at this
[18977.30s -> 18980.50s]  What?
[18980.50s -> 18981.94s]  Why?
[18981.94s -> 18992.23s]  I'm not trying to soak his XP. I just want those souls. I'm scared to walk in here
[18992.23s -> 19008.17s]  I don't know where gragas is. I gotta come bot to help my twitch so they don't freeze the wave
[19008.17s -> 19013.55s]  Like I don't want them to be able to freeze here
[19015.70s -> 19018.04s]  Even if Gragas ganks we win we win the fight right now
[19020.17s -> 19024.41s]  Like it's an easy fight win as long as we don't get knocked up. We just win the fight automatically
[19024.41s -> 19035.14s]  I actually we're trying to bait Gragas to come gank this
[19043.46s -> 19044.74s]  Easy
[19044.74s -> 19046.74s]  double flashes, baby easy
[19051.38s -> 19053.38s]  You fucking cowards
[19053.42s -> 19069.04s]  We should back up. I can go by now. Oh Gragas is top
[19069.68s -> 19071.68s]  We could actually maybe do dragon
[19071.92s -> 19078.42s]  Yo, I'm gonna be real a soul roaming is not a not in like the top list of me being like nervous about it
[19079.28s -> 19082.66s]  Like I'm not nervous about a soul roaming man
[19083.26s -> 19088.68s]  Push this so we can oh we're diving them
[19089.70s -> 19093.30s]  That's a bit scary. Welcome to the League of Draven
[19094.12s -> 19096.66s]  Good to see you're back to enjoying the game. Oh
[19097.38s -> 19099.38s]  We're going still diving that that's not good
[19100.06s -> 19116.32s]  Like we back off here man. I mean we can maybe go up here if you really want to I kind of want to ward this
[19117.26s -> 19131.27s]  I need to reset though really badly right now. Like really badly
[19133.19s -> 19135.53s]  Not being on the map here is really bad
[19136.91s -> 19138.91s]  Or rather not like having
[19139.27s -> 19142.27s]  Gold spent and being on the map is what I'm gonna say. Like it's really fucking bad
[19143.07s -> 19146.75s]  Yo back up, you know, Greg is that you watched him walk past three wards
[19148.03s -> 19150.55s]  That's why I just warded. No, no, he's still here
[19151.43s -> 19153.43s]  Ragas is right there
[19154.19s -> 19165.03s]  Like we know gragas is somewhere bot lane right now. I don't know where but we know he's there they're on dragon. Okay
[19165.93s -> 19167.93s]  We can fight this go go go
[19168.33s -> 19186.63s]  W over I'm here. Nice. Yo, come here
[19188.13s -> 19191.09s]  Yeah, I'll help you come get this come get this motherfuckers blue I
[19192.93s -> 19211.05s]  Got you baby
[19211.05s -> 19220.30s]  What the fuck made a bitch?
[19227.00s -> 19229.00s]  Well, I guess I'll back
[19229.00s -> 19234.52s]  Yo Spartan, thank you for the six months man. Welcome back. Appreciate it
[19235.96s -> 19238.64s]  Guess we'll back. We'll get our fucking umbral
[19239.96s -> 19241.96s]  I'm gonna go top side of the map now
[19242.56s -> 19244.80s]  And I'm gonna help my team get rift heralds
[19245.60s -> 19248.48s]  I'm gonna ping I want to go top side. I want to help my team get rifts
[19249.12s -> 19259.26s]  The wave if we look at bot wave, it's pushing into us. It's totally fine
[19260.14s -> 19262.14s]  Okay, which is level six
[19263.58s -> 19265.78s]  The bot waves pushing in we are totally fine
[19265.82s -> 19286.81s]  to do what I'm doing right now he doesn't know I'm here I'm dead though
[19286.81s -> 19303.83s]  bro no joke I almost juked that that's so close I was hoping like Wukong for
[19303.83s -> 19313.85s]  some reason didn't walk topside but the enemy bot lane did okay the enemy
[19313.85s -> 19317.63s]  bot lane just griefed their entire game the game's over we win what the
[19317.63s -> 19323.59s]  fuck are they do what is happening like my twitch is just getting free
[19323.59s -> 19345.34s]  plates wait you guys are griefing I'm griefing dude what the fuck we why would
[19345.34s -> 19353.24s]  you fight them guys guys guys Wukong Wukong okay we see that our twitch is
[19353.24s -> 19358.20s]  getting free plates bot free first turret okay I'm backed I almost soloed
[19358.20s -> 19364.96s]  their ad carry okay or their jungler why would you ever on purpose take a
[19364.96s -> 19369.12s]  For a fight like that with no oh I have cancer. I
[19370.30s -> 19371.38s]  also
[19371.38s -> 19376.26s]  The Wukong's an idiot. He doesn't understand macro at all apparently because I literally
[19376.66s -> 19380.12s]  Pinned to come to Rift my Wukong was like nervous
[19383.04s -> 19389.08s]  Like for some reason Wukong didn't walk top. He sat bot trying to gank, but the objective was Rift not
[19389.08s -> 19394.12s]  God, I'm losing my mind in this ELO.
[19394.12s -> 19399.20s]  Masters players are literally just diamond players with slightly better mechanics.
[19399.20s -> 19402.42s]  They don't know anything about the game and I'm about to, my brain's about to explode
[19402.42s -> 19405.64s]  like a peanut.
[19405.64s -> 19409.58s]  It's not about them laning 2v2, you fucking cumquat.
[19409.58s -> 19412.84s]  Dude, I know they can't lane against us 2v2.
[19412.84s -> 19414.80s]  It's not about the 2v2, man.
[19414.80s -> 19418.58s]  We get a free Rift Herald because we shut down their bot lane and I'm on an item
[19418.58s -> 19423.14s]  spike so we just automatically get a free rift it has nothing to do with 2v2
[19426.71s -> 19437.11s]  this kumquat motherfucker i don't know why that's my insult the pedestrian guy got to me
[19439.35s -> 19458.56s]  somehow where the fuck is this ward oh because i'm telling you right now my macro there was
[19458.56s -> 19474.21s]  100 correct by the way like 1000 like even though i died i know it was correct no no just
[19474.21s -> 19476.21s]  Just do dragon do not dive
[19476.41s -> 19479.85s]  Guys, we don't have to not everything's about kills. Not everything's about kills. We got this
[19481.05s -> 19484.31s]  Like you don't need to dive. You don't need to dive always you don't need to see a kill be like
[19484.31s -> 19492.29s]  Ooh monkey kill brain go like the game is about like getting objectives on timers and playing off of tempo and things like that
[19492.81s -> 19498.29s]  Like the only reason we even lost rift was because my Wukong went full monkey brain and was like no
[19498.29s -> 19502.01s]  We need to not play for this rift with a giant massive lead
[19502.01s -> 19532.31s]  Wait, kill this guy. What am I watching right now?
[19532.31s -> 19536.83s]  This is outrageous. My Wukong just solo ulted their... Dude, I'm gonna lose it. My Wukong
[19536.83s -> 19553.40s]  just solo ulted their Gragas. On a good note though, they don't get any plates off of
[19553.40s -> 19559.84s]  rifting so it's not that bad. Okay man, just push. Like, dude, hit the minions. Like,
[19560.20s -> 19563.77s]  My bad
[19563.77s -> 19567.49s]  Sorry, I'm wound up right now Kenan. Okay, I'm a little wound
[19568.55s -> 19570.55s]  Apologies if I if I griefed you man
[19572.21s -> 19574.21s]  It's fine
[19574.41s -> 19576.41s]  So the wound up it's fine. I
[19576.97s -> 19582.73s]  Just don't like when like stuff like that happens. I'm a perfectionist and it's my big I talked about this earlier
[19582.73s -> 19586.01s]  I'm a perfectionist. My biggest flaw is that like I will
[19586.01s -> 19592.45s]  They'll play the game 100% correctly on like tempo and timers, but you can't do that because
[19592.45s -> 19599.84s]  you got to remember to like your teammates or teammates like they're not just going
[19599.84s -> 19613.49s]  to instantly know exactly what you're what what to do.
[19613.49s -> 19614.61s]  We win that guy.
[19614.61s -> 19618.63s]  Don't just stand here and watch me die, man.
[19618.63s -> 19624.05s]  Holy shit.
[19624.05s -> 19625.69s]  That is oh my god.
[19625.69s -> 19629.73s]  If he if he had let me die there, I might have screamed.
[19629.73s -> 19638.37s]  screamed out loud in anger like dude is watching me kite these people within one inch of my life
[19639.81s -> 19642.69s]  and instead of like helping or walking up and doing anything you know what he does
[19645.33s -> 19654.07s]  he pulls a fucking gross score my man just likes to watch something wrong with it but you know
[19654.07s -> 19673.72s]  there's a time and a place i don't actually want to buy pinks because i don't think we're
[19673.72s -> 19677.56s]  strong enough that uh i don't think that we're strong enough that i can actually even defend
[19677.56s -> 19681.56s]  the pinks right now if i'm being honest like we should be strong enough but we kind of
[19681.56s -> 19697.40s]  through our lead when I over forced the rift so I think I think we need to push
[19697.40s -> 19702.92s]  this wave so that we can get tempo and move around the map prior sorry I keep
[19702.92s -> 19713.96s]  saying the wrong thing oh that guy's dead I have to ditch that guy he's dead
[19713.96s -> 19720.72s]  as fuck oh I'm dead too maybe oh I am so dead yeah that was my bad that
[19720.72s -> 19722.32s]  That was my bad, my bad, my bad.
[19722.32s -> 19728.10s]  Like, we just got ran down, that was on me.
[19728.10s -> 19730.32s]  Like, we had good positioning,
[19730.32s -> 19736.94s]  but the jungler wasn't close enough, so this is my bad.
[19736.94s -> 19738.98s]  I also didn't expect to get fucking four-mans,
[19738.98s -> 19743.35s]  but I should have, right?
[19743.35s -> 19745.33s]  We should play for this, though.
[19745.33s -> 19746.17s]  I wish I could type,
[19746.17s -> 19748.17s]  I wish I wasn't chat restricted for a year.
[19749.55s -> 19752.95s]  Dude, I swear to God, I'm not even being mean.
[19752.95s -> 19754.97s]  Like, Riot was like, they chat restricted me
[19754.97s -> 19758.99s]  because I type so much macro that it gets on people's nerves and they don't
[19758.99s -> 19779.71s]  want me spam typing low key don't play don't play for rifts I need help guys
[19779.71s -> 19796.37s]  if you guys can help we need to clear vision on dragon a year yeah I get
[19796.37s -> 19805.21s]  uncharted starts at April 15th or April 11th or some shit 2024 I've never seen
[19805.21s -> 19809.47s]  it it must have been like an actual writer or something like I've never
[19809.47s -> 19813.75s]  seen an automated system give you a year chat restricts right so in my mind it's
[19813.75s -> 19821.38s]  got to be like an actual like like a rioter was like Geronimo we know you're
[19821.38s -> 19826.42s]  good enough to climb but stop typing you know I mean that's like what must have
[19826.42s -> 19853.08s]  been going on and I'm like okay well sure I mean I didn't know you could get
[19853.08s -> 19857.16s]  chat banned a year what's weird is like I said I don't like say trigger
[19857.16s -> 19860.48s]  words it's not like I tell people to like end themselves and stuff it's
[19860.48s -> 19865.74s]  It's mainly just me typing, like, go here, do that, do this, like, I type a lot, right?
[19865.74s -> 19869.86s]  Which is obviously, like, if you type a lot, it can be toxic as well, so.
[19869.86s -> 19886.65s]  Like, typing a lot's annoying, so I get it.
[19886.65s -> 19890.99s]  We should be playing for Baron side vision right now, not...
[19890.99s -> 19894.49s]  The vision we're playing with right now is bad, we should be playing over here.
[19894.49s -> 19899.01s]  Like, I wanna play for Baron vision, but it's a little hard to do that right
[19899.01s -> 19904.52s]  now.
[19904.52s -> 19907.96s]  Because you see how tom kenshin me are like transferring vision control around the map right now
[19908.68s -> 19912.04s]  We're playing this little support game of like hide the vision
[19913.72s -> 19916.54s]  Look at this fuck look at this motherfucker
[19931.34s -> 19952.67s]  Oh, he's so dumb I still think he's dumb how did I just take
[19958.81s -> 19962.25s]  Tonight I took my entire hp bar on a global
[19962.65s -> 19970.80s]  my bad dude I really wish the malphite would group though I get that he's like
[19970.80s -> 19974.92s]  doing the thing where he's like oh let's you know split I like his play was
[19974.92s -> 19978.80s]  actually really smart there the malphite's play I mean like that
[19978.80s -> 19982.20s]  wasn't his fault that we got shit on at all I just wish that he would group
[19982.20s -> 19987.08s]  because if he groups up and hits R we win every team fight because right now
[19987.08s -> 19990.92s]  our only frontliner is the Wukong right and the fact that Wukong's our
[19990.92s -> 19996.08s]  frontliner we don't have the ability to play the game when I get stuck on that
[19996.08s -> 20000.94s]  what the fuck was that like that Tom kinch getting to eat forward like that
[20000.94s -> 20005.44s]  blindly into our entire team and then not getting punished for it might be
[20005.44s -> 20009.00s]  the most like solo queue thing I've ever seen nobody wanted to hit him because
[20009.00s -> 20021.45s]  he was the tank but yeah that's we should still kill him you know we can
[20021.45s -> 20027.45s]  fight this guy oh my god jungler just come oh we're forfeiting okay that makes
[20027.45s -> 20035.85s]  perfect sense right just come group bro Kennen come group please guys like I
[20035.85s -> 20039.21s]  don't know why everybody's frustrated we're literally still up in gold
[20039.21s -> 20046.37s]  please come group up we just took an inhibitor just just come group help me
[20046.37s -> 20050.55s]  get vision on this dragon so that I don't so we don't die like I need my
[20050.55s -> 20055.98s]  team to actually walk over here to help me get vision it's really frustrating
[20055.98s -> 20059.62s]  because I need the frontliners the Wukong and the Malphite to walk in with
[20059.62s -> 20064.22s]  me because I'm a little fucking well I have a big gun but I'm a big gun girl
[20064.22s -> 20068.10s]  right so I need I need these two guys to walk in with me these two big
[20068.10s -> 20077.14s]  burly mountain men so that I can play the game you know no we don't
[20077.14s -> 20080.42s]  push bot no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[20080.42s -> 20085.02s]  no bot is worthless come in my Malphite's pushing the wave that we
[20085.02s -> 20089.90s]  already have down. I wish I could macro. I wish I could type some macro right now.
[20089.90s -> 20096.56s]  They're, they're like, my team is so lost. They're so beyond lost right now, it's
[20096.56s -> 20111.22s]  crazy. They're lost as shit. Just do, do dragon, guys. Just do this. Just do, I'll
[20111.22s -> 20114.58s]  start it for you. Here you go. I don't know why we're standing in a bush
[20114.58s -> 20123.70s]  waiting for them to face check. Do dragon, guys. I swear to God, you have
[20123.70s -> 20127.02s]  to do everything in the Z-Lo where you have to start every fight. I have
[20127.02s -> 20129.82s]  Basically, I have to start every fight, right?
[20129.82s -> 20134.02s]  I have to not only start every fight, but I have to ping my team what to do exactly.
[20134.02s -> 20137.02s]  Because everybody plays so safe in this elo.
[20137.02s -> 20140.02s]  Why did my Malphite just stop his back?
[20141.02s -> 20143.02s]  Why are you all fighting?
[20147.51s -> 20149.51s]  Oh my god, please guys.
[20149.51s -> 20154.55s]  It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[20154.55s -> 20157.55s]  No, Malphite, you can't 1v9 that.
[20157.55s -> 20158.55s]  Just back off.
[20158.55s -> 20161.55s]  They didn't get anything. They didn't get anything, we got dragon.
[20161.55s -> 20163.55s]  We're on Dragon Soul Points?
[20164.85s -> 20166.61s]  I'm losing hairs.
[20166.61s -> 20167.97s]  I'm losing fucking hairs, man.
[20167.97s -> 20170.29s]  I ain't got many hairs to spare anymore.
[20170.29s -> 20177.56s]  We're out here losing hair.
[20177.56s -> 20178.52s]  It's like I'm babysitting.
[20178.52s -> 20180.44s]  Like this has got to be what a preschool teacher feels like,
[20180.44s -> 20181.64s]  you know?
[20181.64s -> 20183.12s]  Like low-key.
[20183.12s -> 20185.28s]  Like preschool teacher just feels like this.
[20185.28s -> 20191.56s]  This has to be it.
[20191.56s -> 20193.12s]  Like watching, it's like watching a toddler.
[20193.12s -> 20194.96s]  Like you watch them from the corner, right?
[20194.96s -> 20196.60s]  And they're like eating glue.
[20196.60s -> 20198.88s]  And you're like, I mean, that's bad.
[20198.88s -> 20200.40s]  And then you tell them like, don't eat glue.
[20200.40s -> 20201.56s]  Don't eat glue, Timmy.
[20201.56s -> 20202.80s]  And he's like, okay.
[20202.80s -> 20204.40s]  And then like you leave him there for five minutes
[20204.40s -> 20206.72s]  to go like do something to watch somebody else.
[20206.72s -> 20208.36s]  Then all of a sudden Timmy's eating glue again.
[20208.36s -> 20210.84s]  And you're like, bro, bro, bro,
[20211.84s -> 20221.01s]  we just had this discussion.
[20221.01s -> 20222.53s]  And it's like not Timmy's fault, right?
[20222.53s -> 20223.73s]  Because he's a toddler.
[20224.77s -> 20227.17s]  So you can't be mad at Timmy because he's a toddler.
[20227.17s -> 20229.57s]  You can't, but it's like, it's frustrating.
[20229.57s -> 20242.32s]  It's like, God damn it, man.
[20242.32s -> 20243.30s]  Like what is, what is happening?
[20243.30s -> 20244.90s]  Like Malphite, just group.
[20244.90s -> 20248.58s]  My Malphite has a fetish with just pushing bot.
[20248.58s -> 20249.90s]  Bro, just group and hit R.
[20251.62s -> 20254.58s]  Bro, I know you have Bork.
[20254.58s -> 20257.88s]  Wait, you have Bork?
[20257.88s -> 20260.80s]  Wait, I...
[20260.80s -> 20262.56s]  Bro, we need to be able to engage.
[20262.56s -> 20264.76s]  We don't win through split.
[20264.76s -> 20266.56s]  Just group up, hit R, and we win.
[20267.84s -> 20269.56s]  Like, I've been controlling the ever-living fuck
[20269.56s -> 20271.48s]  out of all the vision this game.
[20271.48s -> 20272.68s]  I feel like I'm doing all of this
[20272.68s -> 20274.28s]  to control vision and shit,
[20274.28s -> 20276.88s]  and it still feels like it's not enough.
[20276.88s -> 20281.27s]  It's kind of nuts.
[20281.27s -> 20290.05s]  Loki, it still feels not enough.
[20290.05s -> 20291.69s]  No, don't go bot, don't go bot, don't go bot,
[20291.69s -> 20293.29s]  don't go bot, please don't go bot.
[20294.97s -> 20304.55s]  Hit me!
[20304.55s -> 20315.04s]  They don't have a ward, they don't know I'm there.
[20315.04s -> 20322.24s]  What, we're just not gonna ult that guy or what?
[20322.24s -> 20325.04s]  This is why we listen.
[20326.16s -> 20329.48s]  Oh my God, I have, I actually just, I'm so,
[20329.48s -> 20331.04s]  I don't know what to say.
[20331.04s -> 20332.88s]  Like I literally pinged to come.
[20332.88s -> 20336.28s]  Wukong didn't use ulti, Twitch just died in,
[20336.28s -> 20337.42s]  And now he's AFK.
[20337.42s -> 20338.26s]  Oh my God.
[20338.26s -> 20339.88s]  Oh my God, kill me in game.
[20339.88s -> 20340.80s]  Kennen and Malphite.
[20340.80s -> 20351.47s]  Can you guys do anything like...
[20351.47s -> 20377.73s]  Bro, can we, can we like, just go in Kennen, just ulti.
[20377.73s -> 20380.39s]  Okay guys, we get, we get Baron here.
[20380.39s -> 20382.55s]  Look, the enemy team threw, go to Baron.
[20383.43s -> 20384.27s]  Please.
[20385.15s -> 20386.95s]  Please go Baron.
[20386.95s -> 20392.46s]  Please.
[20392.46s -> 20400.21s]  We get Sol and Baron here.
[20400.21s -> 20402.89s]  Dude, I swear to God, these people are not real.
[20407.26s -> 20409.06s]  Bro, we do not need the Malphite.
[20409.90s -> 20411.90s]  I am a higher level than my jungler
[20416.40s -> 20418.64s]  Push mid guys. You got to push mid first
[20419.56s -> 20421.56s]  Listen homies, you got to push mid first
[20422.40s -> 20428.41s]  You know what? Fuck it. Don't even go in. Yeah, fuck it push mid
[20429.19s -> 20433.45s]  We're just gonna end the game if they go for dragon here. We just we just push fuck it
[20434.51s -> 20441.27s]  That's actually such a good macro call not even joking
[20454.04s -> 20456.04s]  Such a good macro call actually
[20461.40s -> 20463.40s]  Everybody just run though. Just run
[20463.96s -> 20466.88s]  No, don't don't ulti in no guys. We don't fight this
[20467.32s -> 20469.32s]  Oh, I have cancer
[20469.92s -> 20471.92s]  We're getting flanked boys
[20472.36s -> 20475.88s]  Dude, I have such high levels of cancer right now. You have no idea
[20476.80s -> 20479.38s]  Like high high fucking functioning cancer
[20480.32s -> 20520.07s]  You guys just kill the fucking gragas. Oh my god. Thank god. Thank god. Just end the game
[20520.97s -> 20524.43s]  Please end the game. Please hit the fucking thing. Oh, oh
[20525.99s -> 20531.47s]  My god, Walter White is like my hero right now. I don't even understand
[20531.63s -> 20539.47s]  Like I feel like every like I feel like what Walter White felt like dealing with Skyler for literally three years like this is outrageous
[20540.27s -> 20550.93s]  This is what this feels like like I I can relate to the show so much more. Oh my god, like dude
[20552.45s -> 20577.72s]  Holy crap
[20578.52s -> 20582.64s]  There to look at just look at the like look at like what's going on in the game
[20583.16s -> 20593.40s]  Like I I don't even mean to be mean about this. It's just this is this is crazy
[20596.73s -> 20598.73s]  Malphite though popping off
[20599.57s -> 20620.74s]  Malphite popping off like what do you know is this guy? Oh, he's literally diamond. Why is this guy in this game?
[20620.74s -> 20622.74s]  I mean, I feel I feel like
[20623.18s -> 20627.06s]  Confused now. I'm not even blaming the Wukong anymore. I don't know why this guy is in the game. Oh
[20628.86s -> 20637.45s]  He hasn't flay to that's MMR. Oh, he just has previous season inflated MMR
[20637.95s -> 20640.91s]  That's what this is cuz he was GM for three years
[20641.91s -> 20646.63s]  So the his MMR says that he like belongs here even though he doesn't play like I bet you last season
[20646.63s -> 20653.24s]  He only played like 50 games. I can look right we just see like how many games he played
[20653.48s -> 20655.66s]  Yeah, he played he played like 50 games last season
[20656.32s -> 20659.44s]  So like his MMR didn't really change. He just got masters and then stopped
[20660.84s -> 20672.14s]  Which is fine. There's no one with that's I just wish he would chill, you know
[20673.66s -> 20676.80s]  Like like not rage quit halfway through the game
[20676.80s -> 20682.55s]  Because like I said people's elo and shit used to bother me a lot
[20682.55s -> 20684.83s]  I don't I don't get bothered by anymore because I realized it was cringe
[20684.83s -> 20689.01s]  I don't care about their elo and shit what I care about is like I just want them to play the game
[20689.01s -> 20694.11s]  You know what I mean? Like I just want them to not rage not not like be absolute apes in the game and just play
[20694.11s -> 20695.67s]  That's all I ask for I
[20695.67s -> 20699.03s]  Don't care if you're a diamond player or a plot player in the game and you're just like accidentally in the game
[20699.03s -> 20701.15s]  It's not your fault. I just want you to push buttons
[20705.33s -> 20713.98s]  What I'm doing wrong to have a 36% win rate. I can't see the link because just you'd have to give me your name
[20713.98s -> 20720.67s]  in your server how you guys doing by the way everybody having a good day you guys
[20720.67s -> 20725.55s]  enjoying the stream having a good time watching me go bald in live like live
[20725.55s -> 20728.99s]  time you guys are like oh look Geronimo's going bald live on stream and
[20728.99s -> 20770.80s]  I'm like yeah it's rough hold on I'm gonna take my pants off
[20771.00s -> 20780.03s]  dude what I fuck you guys they fucking like I get double swap did you guys
[20780.03s -> 20782.83s]  see that shit like oh yeah the support could do it and then he banned
[20782.83s -> 20784.59s]  Senna I
[20784.59s -> 20786.59s]  Mean I didn't hover it. That's my bad
[20787.35s -> 20795.46s]  God damn it. I should have hovered. I was just like taking my pants off and now he wants first pick
[20797.70s -> 20803.95s]  Dude, what? Oh my god. I hate I don't I don't know. I don't know what to say. This is crazy
[20808.89s -> 20810.89s]  Today's Thursday, right? I
[20811.77s -> 20824.28s]  Am I losing days today's Thursday, right guys? It is okay, cool. Oh
[20826.08s -> 20828.60s]  What do I play they have Zareth and the Zen
[20830.40s -> 20842.07s]  Avzaya, I mean, I guess I could just play Rakan. It's not a big deal. Let's see what their bot lane is though
[20842.07s -> 20844.79s]  I actually have to see what their bot lane is to choose my runes
[20848.58s -> 20850.58s]  Sona? No.
[20851.14s -> 20853.14s]  Oh, they have an Ezreal
[20853.22s -> 20855.22s]  The fuck is their team comp? Um
[20858.21s -> 20888.89s]  Okay, when you do this build, what's the secondary supposed to be? I think it's supposed to be this or maybe like revitalize
[20890.21s -> 20892.29s]  I just feel like Unflinching is so good. Oh
[20894.86s -> 20896.86s]  They have a support
[20897.16s -> 20900.12s]  Zareth so supports. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so I want I
[20901.04s -> 20903.28s]  Definitely want glacial here and I want
[20905.20s -> 20909.36s]  Maybe I take MR actually instead of armor because they have two poke champs
[20910.60s -> 20920.20s]  And I take this. Yeah. Yeah, this is good. Okay, that's not bad. Okay, what's that? I'll be ready. I need to get some more water
[20986.95s -> 20989.21s]  Oh shit, no, don't flag me
[20990.97s -> 20992.97s]  Fuck man, I had to pee
[20993.73s -> 20995.73s]  Fucking flag me for AFK cuz I'd take a leak
[20996.41s -> 21002.16s]  Can you not start with 80 carry then move over to support? I always fall asleep before the 80 carry gameplay
[21003.18s -> 21005.90s]  Wait, what? I'm supposed to sleep before 80 carry
[21006.58s -> 21008.58s]  What do you mean? Oh
[21008.98s -> 21011.28s]  You mean like start with my main and then play?
[21013.86s -> 21015.86s]  Yeah, I played 80 carry at the start
[21015.86s -> 21031.73s]  Uh, I should probably play ad carry more over support
[21033.89s -> 21035.49s]  Later in the stream
[21035.49s -> 21038.97s]  Here, I'll play an ad carry game after this. I feel bad. Oh
[21056.90s -> 21059.98s]  It's gragas. I thought it was gonna be Zareth, but it's gragas. I
[21063.79s -> 21068.39s]  Don't want to fight too hard level one, even though that that guy I should have gone in there. That's my bad
[21068.39s -> 21072.67s]  I want to I want to try and get level two here, even though I think we actually win level one
[21072.67s -> 21079.48s]  Oh, I got his bone plating. Yeah, I should have fought level one. That was my bad
[21080.52s -> 21083.04s]  Because we went very hard level one. I just griefed it
[21084.28s -> 21088.64s]  Like all I have to do there is go in on the Ezreal or the Gragas level one and they can't play the game
[21090.16s -> 21108.52s]  Right, it's not worth it's not worth
[21110.00s -> 21117.95s]  There's no way that I can not get E'd by Gragas there by the way, I don't know if I can flash W there
[21129.06s -> 21131.06s]  Maybe we shouldn't be egoing buddy
[21135.82s -> 21155.27s]  Guy it's just fucking egos in front of me. Like what? Okay, I might have missed everything there but like
[21157.31s -> 21173.30s]  You know, it's okay it's a little counterproductive
[21175.26s -> 21177.98s]  When I take a tower shot to land a Q
[21179.54s -> 21181.54s]  Feels a little counterproductive
[21188.81s -> 21190.45s]  but hey
[21190.45s -> 21195.94s]  I'm gonna back here just in case
[21196.78s -> 21199.14s]  the enemy Xin tries to gank mid
[21201.73s -> 21203.81s]  Dude, I'm so sad. I can't get boots
[21204.65s -> 21212.39s]  I'm gonna wait. Yeah, I'm gonna be cringe. I'm gonna wait. I
[21213.15s -> 21217.47s]  Would never wait here normally, but you know what? It's just it's so like it's such a big bye. I
[21219.03s -> 21221.03s]  Don't want to I'm
[21221.47s -> 21226.15s]  Now that now that I've waited and beat cringe now, I have to sit here and wait. Oh, it's so painful
[21226.63s -> 21228.43s]  Okay, I'm on my way
[21228.43s -> 21247.39s]  I'm sorry guys
[21247.39s -> 21254.04s]  Worth the wait. Nah, not at all. I got lucky but
[21254.92s -> 21269.73s]  You know, what's interesting I'd never use the stupid dematerializer
[21269.73s -> 21274.59s]  I think I should have like I should use it on every cannon or some shit, but I just don't do it
[21275.17s -> 21278.13s]  Because I know the reason you're supposed to use it is because it helps you push
[21278.85s -> 21281.61s]  Because you can dematerialize the cannon right and just insta. Yeah
[21282.41s -> 21285.73s]  so you're supposed to use it because it's like a really fast way to push but it's also a I
[21302.96s -> 21306.96s]  Should not have w'd fuck. I won't not the gragas anyway. I
[21307.52s -> 21310.08s]  Fucked up. I shouldn't have w'd the gragas. I should have played it slower
[21313.13s -> 21314.13s]  This guy's gonna die.
[21316.63s -> 21318.19s]  Oh, he's gonna die.
[21318.19s -> 21319.15s]  He put himself against the wall.
[21319.15s -> 21319.99s]  GG.
[21322.01s -> 21323.59s]  That was my fault though.
[21323.59s -> 21328.28s]  100%.
[21328.28s -> 21331.18s]  Cause if I didn't W in, they can't kill us, right?
[21331.18s -> 21333.68s]  And Gragas probably dies to the auto attack anyway.
[21333.68s -> 21335.68s]  My thought process was Gragas is snared.
[21335.68s -> 21337.98s]  So if I W here, but even after,
[21337.98s -> 21339.42s]  like even if I don't get E'd,
[21339.42s -> 21341.32s]  I'm pretty confident I die.
[21377.79s -> 21378.63s]  Damn it, I tried.
[21378.63s -> 21387.00s]  I was out of everything.
[21387.00s -> 21388.96s]  I wonder if I could have played that better.
[21388.96s -> 21390.40s]  Maybe like if I could have weaved
[21390.40s -> 21391.92s]  an extra auto in or something.
[21392.92s -> 21393.76s]  I don't know.
[21395.12s -> 21412.62s]  It's hard to know.
[21412.62s -> 21414.48s]  All right, I'm gonna go mid here.
[21415.42s -> 21419.10s]  I can't, okay.
[21419.10s -> 21419.94s]  Well, I could go mid,
[21419.94s -> 21424.98s]  but I think I wanna sit bot for a bit and get some XP.
[21424.98s -> 21430.17s]  I think it's smarter to do that at this point.
[21430.17s -> 21448.30s]  I think we should push this.
[21448.30s -> 21449.14s]  I don't want to W in,
[21449.14s -> 21450.78s]  because I know Zin's here, yeah.
[21452.06s -> 21453.10s]  That's why I didn't want to W,
[21453.10s -> 21468.33s]  because I know Zin's here.
[21468.33s -> 21470.55s]  They were just making it so obvious, right?
[21470.55s -> 21471.75s]  Like that it was like,
[21472.87s -> 21476.09s]  sometimes when people make shit too good to be true,
[21476.09s -> 21477.43s]  it is too good to be true.
[21478.95s -> 21480.21s]  Like, oh shit, we're just gonna,
[21480.21s -> 21482.27s]  they're just gonna fight us here, cool.
[21483.57s -> 21488.90s]  Oh yeah, I gotta help them push, my bad.
[21488.90s -> 21490.18s]  I'm playing sloppy.
[21515.82s -> 21516.78s]  You guys wanna see a cool trick?
[21516.78s -> 21521.51s]  Watch this.
[21521.51s -> 21524.55s]  She could push the wave and then just min-max the back.
[21524.55s -> 21525.79s]  Ha ha.
[21525.79s -> 21526.71s]  How cool was that?
[21527.35s -> 21534.24s]  She just pushes the wave and I just back next to the bush and she's just like, oh I guess I'll take the free ride
[21534.24s -> 21548.33s]  I
[21548.33s -> 21550.61s]  really need level six badly
[21562.32s -> 21565.92s]  Like bro, I really cannot get level six right now. This is
[21567.40s -> 21573.25s]  Painful
[21573.25s -> 21576.25s]  Hey kill these maybe I'm six off this. Nope. Guess not. I
[21577.25s -> 21580.53s]  Was gonna stay mid there by the way and help the homie. I
[21581.69s -> 21583.53s]  Need to go mid
[21583.53s -> 21614.43s]  This is so awkward
[21627.83s -> 21635.68s]  Bro, help me
[21635.68s -> 21643.08s]  Bro, like you got to walk to me like I can't like my Eve is like here. I'm way over here
[21644.40s -> 21647.04s]  Right and my Eve's like yo homie
[21647.68s -> 21655.97s]  Like dude, I'm sure like we're trying to push the wave in for her and she's just not accepting to wait
[21656.73s -> 21660.77s]  And I can't W the wall
[21660.77s -> 21664.25s]  I mean, I guess I could W the wall because I was trying to walk around right?
[21664.25s -> 21668.65s]  I saw her in trouble when I was here. So I wanted her to walk towards here so I could e over the wall
[21669.45s -> 21672.33s]  That was my thought process e over the wall help the guy
[21672.65s -> 21676.85s]  But he like didn't understand that and I just got shit on and it felt really bad
[21681.75s -> 21684.09s]  Both our solos are getting absolutely shit on
[21684.71s -> 21688.21s]  This is very bad
[21688.25s -> 21691.65s]  Because I don't know how to help our team at this stage
[21692.45s -> 21699.24s]  Like I'm just always behind on tempo now around the map in the wrong spot at the wrong time
[21700.00s -> 21723.66s]  This is so awkward. I
[21725.88s -> 21727.88s]  Have old we could kill this guy
[21734.68s -> 21756.83s]  Mm-hmm, you could maybe kill this in if I sneak in here push the wave push the wave hurry
[21758.33s -> 21776.68s]  He's got a crash it I mean this guy's just dead
[21777.60s -> 21783.92s]  My 80 carry is gonna get fucked for it though. So I hope it was worth
[21784.82s -> 21786.82s]  Like my 80 carries gonna get zones
[21793.36s -> 21797.28s]  it's really hard to tell if anything like that's worth sometimes because I
[21798.72s -> 21802.80s]  Used my ult before a dragon fight we're gonna lose bot tower. There's just so many factors, right?
[21802.80s -> 21806.40s]  It's so hard and now I don't have words. Oh, it's so rough
[21825.76s -> 21828.48s]  I got the ignite off, but dude, I can't believe that gragas lived
[21829.36s -> 21831.36s]  No, oh I had stopwatch
[21832.08s -> 21833.84s]  I have stopwatch
[21833.84s -> 21836.34s]  Oh my god. I'm the worst player in existence
[21837.28s -> 21839.60s]  I actually have the ability to live there
[21840.64s -> 21844.31s]  Oh, no
[21844.31s -> 21846.31s]  I should sell
[21846.47s -> 21848.47s]  My magi is in shame
[21849.11s -> 21851.11s]  I actually just want the item so
[21853.03s -> 21854.37s]  Dude, I'm so bad.
[21855.75s -> 21858.13s]  Dude, Gragas is low-key a good pick versus Rakan though.
[21858.13s -> 21859.83s]  You can stop his engage so easily.
[21868.94s -> 21870.04s]  It's actually low-key a good pick.
[21896.75s -> 21897.11s]  Bro.
[21922.03s -> 21922.85s]  Nice.
[21922.85s -> 21923.25s]  Not bad.
[21934.21s -> 21935.73s]  I kind of want to back off here.
[21938.36s -> 21939.52s]  You know what it feels kind of bad?
[21940.16s -> 21944.52s]  You guys noticed that I just, I got my, uh, I don't know if you guys noticed
[21944.52s -> 21952.33s]  this, but I got my fucking, I got like four assists just now, but it was after
[21952.33s -> 21956.83s]  I sold my mages. How fucking bad does that feel?
[21957.97s -> 21959.21s]  like
[21959.21s -> 21966.44s]  Actually, oh by the way, uh, I wanted to ask you guys
[21968.44s -> 21970.96s]  What ad carry do you guys think is the most
[21971.76s -> 21973.80s]  Sought out for people to learn right now
[21974.48s -> 21981.53s]  Like what would you say is like people want to learn this ad carry over other ad carries?
[21982.13s -> 21984.13s]  What are you guys thinking?
[21984.29s -> 21986.29s]  My man says Teemo. Okay
[21986.53s -> 21988.53s]  Makes sense
[21988.53s -> 21997.60s]  Got it
[21997.60s -> 22000.40s]  Depends. Yeah, I'm just trying to wonder like what um
[22002.12s -> 22005.76s]  People would want to watch or what people would want to learn specifically
[22006.40s -> 22009.84s]  So I know everybody plays different shit, but I know there's also like popular shit, you know
[22015.16s -> 22017.16s]  Okay, I'm just bad
[22017.52s -> 22020.20s]  He's bad too. Listen, we're we're bad
[22023.48s -> 22068.97s]  We're bad guys
[22069.01s -> 22072.11s]  Not bad
[22072.11s -> 22074.11s]  Jin Lucian's I a Phelios
[22074.27s -> 22077.99s]  Damn is it like just that different like a lot of people like different stuff
[22079.86s -> 22082.78s]  because I've always just thought like oh no, I
[22090.40s -> 22092.68s]  guess I've always just thought that people like a
[22095.79s -> 22099.69s]  Lot of people really like like meta ad carries or like really play makey ad carries, right?
[22099.87s -> 22106.71s]  Like Jinx is probably the best ad carry in the meta, but I don't say a lot of people ever ask or like request to watch Jinx
[22107.19s -> 22107.87s]  You know what?
[22107.87s -> 22111.59s]  I mean like Jinx is not like she's not like a fun ad carry that people want to learn how to play
[22111.79s -> 22113.79s]  Even though she is like the best ad
[22114.19s -> 22116.51s]  There's like the people who are like, oh yeah, no jinks is boring
[22116.51s -> 22120.27s]  Like I want to play jinn and like shoot people or I want to play like lucian and bash around like it's like
[22120.27s -> 22124.51s]  So that's what i'm wondering is like what the number one 80 carry is for like people just like enjoy watching
[22140.12s -> 22141.56s]  Not bad though
[22141.56s -> 22143.96s]  Okay, I think we could play an 80 carry game. I'm done
[22147.00s -> 22149.00s]  I I owe you guys an 80 carry game
[22149.56s -> 22152.20s]  I owe you that much for watching me play support for two hours
[22152.76s -> 22154.76s]  Actually, I think it was like two and a half hours
[22156.97s -> 22159.29s]  Uh, yeah, we played four games of support. So it's like two hours
[22159.29s -> 22172.16s]  Yeah, I owe you guys for for that Zyra or Vayne Zyra is fun to watch I do like
[22172.16s -> 22183.01s]  Zyra you love Jinx and Cait oh yeah you're playing support top so you like
[22183.01s -> 22188.13s]  to watch how ad carries play it ah so that you can like better help the
[22188.13s -> 22204.56s]  homies got it got it we need eight wins I think from this point we are
[22204.56s -> 22213.72s]  right now I think it's eight wins to get to Grandmaster I think oops because
[22213.72s -> 22221.28s]  we're what 370 something right like three set 360 no we just won we're not 360 we're
[22221.28s -> 22234.03s]  like 370 for 387 okay so it's not updated but what is this stop so we need what seven
[22234.03s -> 22241.27s]  wins net wins to get to GM I think we can hit GM I'm a little less confident right
[22241.27s -> 22246.69s]  now about master or about challenger but I think we can definitely hit GM like I
[22246.69s -> 22258.58s]  I think I'll get stuck in gym for a bit, unless the games get higher quality, I'll be stuck
[22258.58s -> 22265.20s]  in gym for a little bit.
[22265.20s -> 22270.44s]  Because the thing about the games so far is like, the higher quality the games get,
[22270.44s -> 22274.86s]  the easier it actually is to carry if you're a decent player.
[22274.86s -> 22278.56s]  Because the better your teammates get, which means that like if you're at that,
[22278.56s -> 22281.74s]  say like a challenger player will have a better time, a challenger AD carry player
[22281.74s -> 22287.64s]  Carrying in challenger if they get a lead then in diamond if they get a lead if if that like
[22287.64s -> 22293.22s]  I know that sounds weird to say but that's it's it's basically just because like when your teammates are better
[22293.22s -> 22297.70s]  They enable you better and ad carry and all those other roles when they're being enabled
[22297.70s -> 22305.08s]  It's a lot easier to play the game
[22305.08s -> 22308.36s]  Like if I were to first pick jinx in challenger MMR
[22308.72s -> 22314.68s]  There's a good chance my teammates would pick stuff that like lets me play jinx right not saying it would happen
[22314.68s -> 22317.02s]  but there's like a chance that my teammates would pick something that like
[22317.60s -> 22321.58s]  They would pick like tanks or frontliners or some shit, right or like Lulu
[22321.86s -> 22326.60s]  Whereas like if you pickin if you're picking jinx first pickin like let's say you guys are gold average
[22326.88s -> 22331.12s]  Well, your support might just literally pick like first-time Vel'Koz or some shit and you're like, well this sucks
[22331.72s -> 22345.97s]  Dude, I swear every time I hear the end of this song
[22346.65s -> 22348.97s]  does anybody know who forest within is I
[22350.61s -> 22355.53s]  Swear the guy talking at the end of this song sounds exactly like forest within
[22478.20s -> 22489.83s]  newtomcroose no joke
[22509.83s -> 22516.07s]  why I play Senna. Right? Like I play Senna because I like being able to carry games as
[22516.07s -> 22523.83s]  support. That's why I like Senna. Whereas like if you're a like if I like I can play
[22523.83s -> 22527.91s]  almost every support right I can play Nautilus I can play boy I can play these sports. But
[22527.91s -> 22532.03s]  the problem is is like I feel bad if like I get like it feels really shitty to get
[22532.03s -> 22534.95s]  people ahead and then have them completely throw their leads over and over again and
[22534.95s -> 22539.03s]  then tilt and range and shit. So it feels like dog shits. So it's nicer to just
[22539.03s -> 22544.23s]  give myself the opportunity to carry it rather than rely 100% on other people.
[22547.06s -> 22553.14s]  But I would say the number one thing is play what you think is fun. That's just the number one
[22553.14s -> 22559.14s]  rule. If you want to win, you can play meta, but the problem is if you're shoving your face
[22559.14s -> 22562.66s]  and trying to learn a meta champ that you just don't enjoy the playstyle of, you're never
[22562.66s -> 22567.86s]  going to actually be good at the champion because it's like you're working. But the best
[22567.86s -> 22571.90s]  The best way to learn the champions and learn how to play the game is to have fun.
[22571.90s -> 22576.02s]  If you're not having fun at some point, you're not going to be able to learn how to play.
[22576.02s -> 22579.22s]  Because you're not going to be able to put in the hours or put in the games and be
[22579.22s -> 22580.46s]  focused during the game.
[22580.46s -> 22581.46s]  You're going to be frustrated.
[22581.46s -> 22583.64s]  And if you're frustrated, you're not going to be learning.
[22583.64s -> 22588.76s]  So I would say just play something that's fun.
[22588.76s -> 22590.88s]  The fun aspect is going to be way more important.
[22590.88s -> 22609.08s]  Where'd my music go?
[22609.08s -> 22610.08s]  I'm surprised.
[22610.08s -> 22611.80s]  Can you guys even hear the music half the time?
[22611.80s -> 22615.60s]  I have it on so low that I'm not even sure you guys can hear it.
[22615.60s -> 22646.32s]  just like barely background noise. Is this guy holding swap hostage? Join call and I'll
[22646.32s -> 22668.78s]  swap dude he's holding swap hostage. By the way, if you guys do like the stream, don't
[22668.78s -> 22674.46s]  forget to follow. You can scroll down to see all my socials too. Like TikTok, Instagram,
[22674.46s -> 22688.16s]  all that crap. It's all below the stream. There's like links and shit. And you know,
[22688.16s -> 22692.16s]  A man's gotta eat. You can use your twitch prime too if you want, you know, if you're feeling it.
[22692.16s -> 22705.84s]  I'm gonna do a Kaisa game.
[22705.84s -> 22709.54s]  He went Lux.
[22709.54s -> 22712.54s]  But, I kinda wanna play Kaisa.
[22712.54s -> 22719.51s]  What was the voice? This is what happens when I get close to the mic.
[22721.51s -> 22725.51s]  I should put the mic in front of my face more. The mic's like over to the corner.
[22725.51s -> 22728.51s]  So the mic is like really badly directioned.
[22752.60s -> 22754.60s]  Is this a cut down game?
[22754.60s -> 22760.87s]  Gragas always uses AP. He doesn't go tank, he goes like AP.
[22760.87s -> 22780.78s]  I kinda want to go last stands. That's fun.
[22780.78s -> 22789.29s]  I should've taken ghost. Ghost sort of went so good this game.
[22789.29s -> 22794.60s]  Tried Kate with shield bow. It's strong? Yeah, it's fun, huh?
[22794.60s -> 22798.60s]  I love Kate with shield bow, it's so fun. This would've been such a good ghost game.
[22798.60s -> 22802.60s]  I'm frustrated. Oh well.
[22802.60s -> 22817.00s]  I like wasn't paying attention. I always wonder if I should go
[22817.00s -> 22824.48s]  go, part of me always wants to go like, uh, long sword three against Thresh and Zaya,
[22824.48s -> 22829.52s]  but with Kaisa, I feel like you're on really specific timers with Kaisa. So you have to
[22829.52s -> 22835.76s]  go like, it's really important to go Doran so that you can get the Q upgrade timer
[22835.76s -> 22840.78s]  on the right, you know, like on the right timing. I've been getting the Q upgrade
[22840.78s -> 22849.18s]  timers just so big also this game i feel like i go bork this game second bork or what's ends
[22850.30s -> 22854.70s]  if gragas is not ultra fed i'll probably go bork because i don't want to get what's end just
[22854.70s -> 22884.46s]  for gragas okay he started q oh diana starting on wolves okay i need to get some coffee after
[22884.46s -> 22907.92s]  this game i'm getting drowsy i should have done the middle minion thing i'm so bad
[22907.92s -> 22911.72s]  Like I should have legitimately just done the thing with the minion
[22912.12s -> 22921.50s]  So when you know thresh starts hook you can still play up right? I can play up I can play aggressive
[22922.04s -> 22941.67s]  I'm bad. I
[22942.03s -> 22944.03s]  Should have just killed the thresh
[22945.07s -> 22951.86s]  This is really bad, man. We can't help we can't help because the wave the way the waves going
[22951.86s -> 22960.29s]  Oh, I'm so bad. I fucked up. It should be fine. But I still like it were it it fucks us over early game
[22960.29s -> 22968.24s]  because they fucked up very badly like I can't stress enough how badly they
[22968.24s -> 22973.88s]  just fucked up but it didn't matter okay that's that's happening
[22973.88s -> 22978.12s]  apparently don't worry guys I'm the best Zaya player or Kai'sa player on the
[22978.12s -> 23007.14s]  server it's me god I am just literally playing like dog shits I picked Kai'sa
[23007.14s -> 23016.19s]  I just felt like playing her we got a back we have to leave the wave in a
[23016.19s -> 23017.59s]  Bad spot
[23017.59s -> 23031.24s]  Maybe she can push it but like Wukong's here. So yeah, we just okay. We got it. Nice. Not bad
[23032.22s -> 23035.50s]  So we had to push the wave in there so that the wave will bounce back
[23035.78s -> 23037.98s]  But we had to do it on it was a really bad timer
[23038.34s -> 23042.44s]  Let me just say I fucked up the entire early game of this game. Like this games. I'm so bad
[23043.66s -> 23048.40s]  Essentially what should have happened was level one when they walked up when Kaisen Thresh walked up level one
[23048.62s -> 23051.00s]  We should have killed them like I should have just straight up
[23051.00s -> 23056.44s]  But hit the Thresh with the Lux, because Thresh walked into our wave, because Wukong was level
[23056.44s -> 23057.44s]  2 ganking.
[23057.44s -> 23058.44s]  Should've just killed him.
[23058.44s -> 23059.56s]  I grieved that.
[23059.56s -> 23062.60s]  And because I went for the Xayah instead, I put myself in a spot where I took like
[23062.60s -> 23065.16s]  80% of my HP for free, right?
[23065.16s -> 23069.88s]  Which put me behind, and now the entire fight was like harder, because I was low.
[23069.88s -> 23071.12s]  And then we had to wait for the wave.
[23071.12s -> 23074.08s]  It was just, it was really bad.
[23074.08s -> 23076.08s]  Really.
[23076.08s -> 23082.61s]  That minion actually just did that.
[23082.61s -> 23086.59s]  I don't think we can kill this guy unless she can max range land a Q or something. But yeah
[23092.20s -> 23097.50s]  Is Zarya the best AD right now? No, I think Jinx is better. I think Zarya is good
[23098.08s -> 23101.42s]  Her late game, especially with like paired with an enchanter, Zarya is insane
[23102.12s -> 23104.80s]  But I think Jinx is better for solo Q
[23106.80s -> 23116.30s]  I actually have to flash. That was a good play hook by that guy. I disrespected him
[23119.12s -> 23122.28s]  Mmm, I might have to leave cuz Wukong can just go here and dive me
[23122.28s -> 23130.14s]  I actually just have to leave this feels so bad. You see how Wukong just used the plants
[23131.86s -> 23137.46s]  If I stay I can just die right so I'm just misplaying all over the place I'm taking too much damage
[23137.46s -> 23139.46s]  We're playing weak side right now, right?
[23139.70s -> 23143.66s]  What I mean by that is like we know our Diana's top and we know they're Wukong's bot
[23143.94s -> 23147.30s]  So because of that I need to play a lot less tradie
[23147.62s -> 23150.94s]  Like I walked up and just let the Thresh flame me for free and I missed two waves now
[23150.94s -> 23156.42s]  I need to not do that because if I don't miss these waves, it doesn't matter for weak sighting because I'm not behind so it's
[23156.94s -> 23158.70s]  It's just really stupid
[23158.70s -> 23166.86s]  Now what I do want to do is I want to go check and see if the Wukong's like on our camps or something
[23166.96s -> 23177.38s]  Or if he's doing dragon or some shits. I should not have used the blast cone dude. I am so bad. I
[23178.38s -> 23184.00s]  Used the blast cone to just hit it. It's playing support man. It makes your it makes your brain smaller
[23185.54s -> 23202.88s]  Actually, like I swear playing support makes my brain smaller
[23211.08s -> 23233.80s]  Oh, they're in dragon the ziya is trolling
[23235.48s -> 23238.55s]  I think
[23238.55s -> 23240.55s]  Pretty sure I just freeze this no with deluxe
[23245.75s -> 23247.75s]  Yeah, she's just trolling. I don't know what the fuck that was
[23250.26s -> 23252.26s]  I took a little bit of damage, but
[23253.46s -> 23276.15s]  She has to overextend now
[23276.15s -> 23277.99s]  Not bad. Okay, so
[23277.99s -> 23282.79s]  The ziya wanted to back the reason that I froze that was because I wants to back but she can't back until we push
[23282.79s -> 23284.23s]  the wave in
[23284.23s -> 23289.59s]  Or till they push the wave in right? So it gives me time to kind of catch up on my back timer with the ziya
[23290.23s -> 23292.39s]  Cuz I'm you know, a little bit behind and farm
[23301.51s -> 23303.51s]  Thresh is definitely gonna go mid here
[23304.15s -> 23307.19s]  He's either gonna go mad or he's gonna try and hook us from the bush. I
[23308.63s -> 23312.99s]  Think I'm gonna shoot my W through all of the bushes here. Okay, Thresh isn't in the bushes
[23314.75s -> 23316.75s]  He's just Mia yeah, we don't know where he is
[23317.35s -> 23323.77s]  This is awkward because I can't really walk up. I mean, I guess I'm almost six. So I guess I could walk up
[23323.77s -> 23333.90s]  Yeah, there he is. Okay. We see him. He is level five. So it's
[23334.78s -> 23338.38s]  We could probably actually fight like if this guy lands a binding I might be able to just trade
[23338.38s -> 23357.87s]  I just I am I'm dead. I suck. Honestly, I I needed to my bad. I'm playing bad. That's on me
[23359.35s -> 23361.45s]  The locks just playing so good. I needed to
[23362.71s -> 23366.17s]  W but then back up after the bind. I've just I'm mechanically
[23366.95s -> 23369.51s]  Shitting on myself right now like out of my mouth just shit
[23373.19s -> 23374.63s]  Cause I knew exactly what was gonna happen
[23374.63s -> 23376.59s]  when I used W in front of the fucking Thresh's face.
[23376.59s -> 23378.29s]  I was like, here we go.
[23378.29s -> 23379.99s]  You know what I mean?
[23379.99s -> 23381.79s]  Technically we're both six and he's five,
[23381.79s -> 23384.47s]  but it doesn't matter because if I get hooked,
[23384.47s -> 23385.29s]  I don't have enough damage.
[23385.29s -> 23395.33s]  So now here, I'm gonna walk up
[23395.33s -> 23397.89s]  and see if I can stop the Ziya's back maybe.
[23397.89s -> 23401.63s]  Or maybe she's backing in a weird spot.
[23401.63s -> 23402.71s]  Yeah, we stopped their backs.
[23402.71s -> 23403.55s]  Huge.
[23403.55s -> 23404.95s]  Okay, now they're in trouble.
[23404.95s -> 23411.51s]  So, they really needed the back on that timer.
[23411.51s -> 23413.87s]  Because they just want to fight, right?
[23413.87s -> 23418.03s]  And because they just want to fight, they want to go back, right?
[23418.03s -> 23419.03s]  No way!
[23419.03s -> 23424.08s]  Dude, fuck off.
[23424.08s -> 23427.40s]  I cannot dodge a hook right now to save my fucking life.
[23427.40s -> 23429.36s]  Jesus Christ.
[23429.36s -> 23433.93s]  What is my movement, man?
[23433.93s -> 23442.67s]  Like tilting myself right now.
[23442.67s -> 23445.79s]  I want to stay for this wave, but mid is Mia.
[23445.79s -> 23449.55s]  Yeah, I can't
[23450.31s -> 23454.71s]  It feels so bad because I needed one more wave to get double pickaxe
[23455.47s -> 23457.27s]  So I can get my upgrade
[23457.27s -> 23461.27s]  Cuz like normally you go noon quiver pickaxe pickaxe if you go noon pick pick
[23461.71s -> 23465.23s]  It gives you enough ad to get your cue upgrade right and that's like the whole point
[23465.23s -> 23468.39s]  You don't need cracking you just need your cue upgrade because your cue upgrades when you start bursting
[23469.31s -> 23474.07s]  But because I got hooked under the turrets, even though we got a kill I had to back and I couldn't get my timer
[23474.55s -> 23486.86s]  I'm so trash. I need some coffee
[23487.02s -> 23489.02s]  That's what it is men. I swear to god
[23489.50s -> 23491.50s]  Coffee is my savior. It'll save me
[23520.74s -> 23523.06s]  That wave actually just did that to me holy shit
[23524.66s -> 23526.74s]  We don't actually have to do anything here crazy
[23539.14s -> 23547.95s]  Nice well played nice
[23558.59s -> 23560.59s]  Nice nice nice
[23561.15s -> 23570.24s]  That was a good 2v2
[23570.24s -> 23574.08s]  All right. I got my q upgrade now. We're chilling. Oh now we're hell not chilling
[23575.52s -> 23581.73s]  Oh, yeah, baby
[23581.73s -> 23586.05s]  You know what it is, it's like uh, I'm playing the fights too quick
[23591.66s -> 23594.22s]  I just gotta slow down and like think I'm like too hyped up
[23606.21s -> 23608.85s]  I really don't want to miss this wave. There's a person right there
[23610.53s -> 23612.53s]  Oh shit, let's go
[23612.93s -> 23615.89s]  Yeah, he's dead. Okay. I'm gonna go farm bot while that guy gets that
[23620.67s -> 23622.67s]  This lux is really good
[23632.18s -> 23634.18s]  I kind of want to oh, I can't get this plate. Fuck
[23636.62s -> 23637.98s]  What?
[23637.98s -> 23639.42s]  What?
[23639.42s -> 23641.42s]  That was BS
[23641.42s -> 23649.60s]  Okay, you know what? I'll just take my entire HP bar really quick on the turret. It's not a big deal guys
[23650.92s -> 23654.26s]  I'm just I'm that good at the game. Like I don't mean to brag but like, you know
[23655.00s -> 23657.00s]  Professional gamer over here like, you know
[23657.64s -> 23661.14s]  Gonna be want some lessons. Like I got you
[23670.66s -> 23672.66s]  Dude, look how big my shield is
[23673.50s -> 23688.46s]  wait
[23688.70s -> 23690.70s]  You son of a bitch I
[23691.74s -> 23708.65s]  Mean she's dead but I got outplayed man
[23708.65s -> 23734.59s]  I need to make some coffee.
[23734.59s -> 23735.59s]  I'm playing bad.
[23735.59s -> 23737.59s]  Give me a sec.
[23737.59s -> 23738.59s]  We're playing real bad.
[23738.59s -> 23753.85s]  I need some coffee.
[23753.85s -> 23754.85s]  Nice though.
[23754.85s -> 23755.85s]  We hit 400 LP.
[23755.85s -> 23756.85s]  Let's go.
[23756.85s -> 23757.85s]  So now we just need 150 more.
[23757.85s -> 23758.85s]  We need 550.
[23758.85s -> 23772.97s]  I think 550 is GM.
[23772.97s -> 23774.33s]  I didn't do anything that game by the way.
[23774.33s -> 23775.33s]  I did nothing.
[23775.33s -> 23777.93s]  I could play another 80 carry game.
[23777.93s -> 23778.93s]  That was fun.
[23778.93s -> 23780.57s]  I'm going to grab some coffee.
[23780.57s -> 23782.57s]  I'll be right back
[23782.81s -> 23785.79s]  Talks amongst yourselves boys. I believe in you
[23786.89s -> 23790.43s]  You can look at my 80 carry tier list that we've been trying to figure out how to do
[23791.25s -> 23794.03s]  Enjoy, I'll be ready. Grab some coffee. Oh
[23795.73s -> 23902.04s]  Fucking a all right. I'm back. Let's go the book
[23906.08s -> 23911.86s]  Be back boys we back
[23911.86s -> 23924.65s]  time is it five oh I play play for like another hour and then I gotta get off
[23924.65s -> 23940.54s]  and make some dinner do some other shit you know I'm saying where were we oh
[23940.54s -> 23945.08s]  yeah we're making the tier list yeah I think various is really good a I think
[23945.08s -> 23950.64s]  versus good eight here cuz um in my opinion various is never really like a
[23950.64s -> 23954.92s]  bad pick almost like sometimes he's bad but I think he's just you can play
[23954.92s -> 23957.86s]  I'm on hit or you can play him without II right
[23957.86s -> 23962.62s]  So he's got two builds that you can do based on the game and the team comp his ulti is pretty much always useful
[23963.50s -> 23967.36s]  Like just having a stun like a root on a champion is always gonna be useful
[23967.36s -> 23972.96s]  Right then you have he's got very long range like engage. You can safely kill people with his ult in this queue
[23973.54s -> 23977.32s]  You can build him poke or like before objectives. You can make picks really easily
[23977.32s -> 23979.32s]  You can poke people out before the objective get him low
[23979.88s -> 23981.48s]  His lane phase is really good
[23981.48s -> 23984.62s]  If you're if you understand like how to play various his lane phase is exceptional
[23984.92s -> 23986.92s]  He also has
[23987.74s -> 23990.82s]  In the meta currently I feel like he's just like a good pick
[23990.82s -> 23995.32s]  I don't think he's as good as Draven and Jinx for solo queue, but I do think he's really good
[23996.06s -> 23998.64s]  In general you can you can climb with them really easily
[23999.64s -> 24002.10s]  And then I put Ashe here, too
[24002.90s -> 24005.34s]  Maybe Ashe. I don't know who I'd put in front
[24006.38s -> 24011.92s]  Ashe or Varus. I thought maybe Ashe or maybe Varus. I think Ashe is really underrated though
[24011.92s -> 24027.06s]  I think Ash is super super good right now. I think Ash is super good
[24027.94s -> 24029.44s]  because
[24029.44s -> 24031.44s]  Sorry, I'm trying to think
[24032.32s -> 24036.32s]  She's basically the same idea as Varus. She's a little different, but she's the same idea. Um
[24038.24s -> 24042.56s]  She controls lane phase pretty well, right like her lane isn't too bad. She also has
[24044.56s -> 24048.74s]  Like her R always useful no matter what so like you always have use with Ash
[24048.74s -> 24052.68s]  You always have use with Varus R like they just stuns snares, etc
[24052.68s -> 24053.84s]  So look here
[24053.84s -> 24058.24s]  She's also really good at being annoying in team fights like you can take ghost on ash and you can just
[24058.44s -> 24061.92s]  volley sit outside the range and if you just be basically solo people and
[24062.36s -> 24064.28s]  She actually has decent scaling on her crit now
[24064.28s -> 24068.06s]  So you can go a bunch of builds to like I think you can go Bork Ash
[24068.06s -> 24073.76s]  You can go crack and slayer ash into Bork or you could go crack and slayer into ie or you can go crack and slayer
[24073.76s -> 24075.52s]  into like
[24075.52s -> 24079.52s]  Whatever you can go shield bow ash if they have tanks you can go gale force that oh you can just do a lot
[24079.52s -> 24081.52s]  Of different builds on ash and I think she's really versatile
[24081.52s -> 24086.68s]  You could also just go to the on-head build if you really want I I think the rage blade build sucks personally
[24086.68s -> 24090.64s]  I think that if I was gonna go on hit I would just be like shield bow wits and into like
[24091.08s -> 24093.64s]  Bork or some shit if I was actually gonna do that or she'll bow
[24094.16s -> 24096.32s]  Bork or pork wits or whatever but
[24097.18s -> 24101.41s]  Yeah, I
[24101.41s -> 24103.69s]  Don't know Ezra was probably a tier two. I
[24105.05s -> 24107.25s]  Said Ezra was really gated by like skill
[24107.81s -> 24112.01s]  So I don't want to put him in I think if you could play Ezra perfectly
[24112.01s -> 24117.23s]  he'd be at the top of S like he would just be above Jinx just best champion in the game
[24117.23s -> 24122.11s]  If you could if you could never miss a skillshot like a hundred percent accuracy playing perfectly the champs insane, right?
[24122.57s -> 24127.85s]  It's absolutely crazy how good that champ is if you can play him perfect, but you're like people are humans, etc
[24128.01s -> 24132.73s]  So I think he's like an a tier pick in solo queue because you can get countered like he's not blindable
[24132.73s -> 24134.73s]  You can get countered pretty easily by good players
[24135.17s -> 24139.21s]  People play like push comps people play dive comps like early game
[24139.21s -> 24142.69s]  I mean in lane and shits like cuz Ezreal's lane is like not it's not bad
[24142.87s -> 24146.39s]  But it's very difficult to play Ezreal well in lane fate
[24146.39s -> 24152.07s]  You got to be good mechanically and I don't think even like I've seen like challenger players who can't play Ezreal. So
[24153.07s -> 24155.07s]  He's not easy
[24155.39s -> 24170.02s]  You know what I'm saying? What's up boys?
[24177.91s -> 24197.38s]  So I was gonna ban Kindred, but I couldn't find her. I
[24198.90s -> 24207.26s]  Hate Kindred. Yo, how we doing tonight? How's everybody's day?
[24207.26s -> 24228.58s]  Okay, so this guy's picking Thresh again
[24229.28s -> 24285.70s]  Thresh into Rakan, Thresh is actually pretty good in the Rakan. They have Xayah, Thresh again. Let's play Jinx. I like Jinx here
[24287.14s -> 24291.72s]  Even though it is against Thresh, Jinx is a little scary, right? But I kind of like her in this situation
[24292.54s -> 24304.42s]  Let's see what runs. Do I want free boots? Nah, I think I want I want to be able to get early boots this game
[24304.94s -> 24309.21s]  because their team comp is like
[24309.21s -> 24317.73s]  Oh, yeah, their team comp is really, really annoying. So I kind of want to get early boots.
[24317.73s -> 24327.78s]  I'll probably go presence of mind. Although I think over hill isn't bad. Actually, I'll
[24327.78s -> 24337.30s]  go over hill. So yeah, these runes look good. Actually, let's do this. Or this. This.
[24337.30s -> 24347.51s]  Yeah, this is good. Okay. I kind of like these. This is good. I'm gonna use these.
[24347.51s -> 24352.93s]  I'm taking claims this game because they have Lissandra and Pantheon and Thresh, right?
[24352.93s -> 24359.63s]  So with Lissandra, Pantheon, and Thresh, the game's gonna be like really fast of like,
[24359.63s -> 24363.59s]  okay, if they stun me, I'm just gonna get CC chained and I'm just gonna die like
[24363.59s -> 24364.59s]  after a bit, right?
[24364.59s -> 24371.58s]  It's gonna be like a stun and they're stun and they're stun and I'm just gonna die.
[24371.58s -> 24400.54s]  So I'm like, nah, fuck that shit.
[24400.54s -> 24409.97s]  Let's see if we can get this W, boys.
[24409.97s -> 24412.53s]  Let's see if I can not fuck up the first three levels of the lane.
[24412.53s -> 24417.33s]  Got your eye restricted?
[24417.33s -> 24419.33s]  Yeah, it's for a while
[24423.44s -> 24428.80s]  It's riot secret code to make it so I could actually play the game and climb without chatting
[24448.03s -> 24449.55s]  Okay
[24449.55s -> 24451.55s]  I should have warded this bush
[24453.71s -> 24459.39s]  I was drinking my coffee. I didn't think about it. But yeah, if you guys are against the hook champ, uh, always ward this bush
[24463.17s -> 24465.17s]  Right like right here. You're gonna want to
[24466.05s -> 24468.05s]  Ward here early against most hook champions
[24469.25s -> 24471.57s]  Because it gives you a very nice
[24472.13s -> 24476.41s]  Like, they can't walk in here and cheese you, they can't walk in here and cheese you, so
[24476.41s -> 24505.66s]  you just don't get cheesed by anything.
[24505.66s -> 24506.66s]  I mean, that's just...
[24506.66s -> 24511.70s]  I don't even know what I just saw.
[24511.70s -> 24516.98s]  I'll be real, I don't know what the fuck just happened, but okay.
[24516.98s -> 24519.82s]  Trying to push this wave as fast as I can.
[24519.82s -> 24533.82s]  Not sure I can actually get it pushed fast enough, but we're gonna try.
[24533.82s -> 24539.46s]  It was close.
[24539.46s -> 24544.22s]  No, I'm gonna let it just push, it's not a huge deal.
[24544.22s -> 24546.38s]  It was very close, though.
[24546.38s -> 24547.38s]  We can just break the freeze, right?
[24547.38s -> 24548.38s]  Like it's not a huge deal.
[24548.38s -> 24554.54s]  Are they supposed to win level one?
[24554.54s -> 24555.54s]  It depends.
[24555.54s -> 24557.78s]  I mean, Xayah's not that good level one.
[24557.78s -> 24561.42s]  Like, Xayah's good because she has her feathers, right?
[24561.42s -> 24565.26s]  But if you can't stack your feathers level one, Jinx has more damage.
[24565.26s -> 24567.44s]  And they stacked up for my rockets.
[24567.44s -> 24572.18s]  So I got like, I full stacked my lethal tempo and I just double AOE rocketed them
[24572.18s -> 24576.84s]  over and over and over and over again, right?
[24576.84s -> 24580.70s]  So when they finally all end they were just behind an HP
[24582.00s -> 24584.30s]  Also Thresh missed he only had Flay
[24584.84s -> 24612.97s]  Damn that was so close man
[24613.89s -> 24634.08s]  Like actually if Thresh had died there or not Thresh if Graves had died there. We just win the game
[24648.63s -> 24651.01s]  Yeah, this isn't good. Oh, I'm gonna get Flay it. I'm dead
[24652.29s -> 24655.19s]  Maybe oh, maybe I'm not dead. I have to walk up like this
[24656.95s -> 24660.37s]  It was a really bad fight by the what what am I watching what the fuck
[24660.63s -> 24668.13s]  That was just a bad fight because we knew Graves was bot and we knew that he was going
[24668.13s -> 24670.63s]  to kill in the jungle, right?
[24670.63s -> 24674.97s]  So like my jungler already got outplayed by Graves once top side.
[24674.97s -> 24677.57s]  You shouldn't ever take another fight like that bot side.
[24677.57s -> 24679.37s]  You should just take the win, right?
[24679.37s -> 24681.21s]  Like I rotated.
[24681.21s -> 24685.19s]  Now granted the Rakan should have been there to help kill the Graves.
[24685.19s -> 24688.91s]  Like when I rotated, Rakan was still jacking off in lane, right?
[24688.91s -> 24693.31s]  when I was here, Rakan was like way down here. So the support should have rotated first,
[24694.59s -> 24698.27s]  right? Like I rotated, but the support should have been the one rotating. But again, he's just,
[24698.83s -> 24702.19s]  a lot of the time you have support players who don't understand timers and how to help
[24702.19s -> 24706.27s]  jungle. Nobody plays for jungle. Support players hate playing for jungle in low elo.
[24707.07s -> 24714.19s]  So it's just not a thing. So I tried to go over and help him, but I misplaced my traps
[24714.19s -> 24723.07s]  a little bit. And then the Graves had a flash, but he got away. And they tried to go in again
[24723.07s -> 24727.95s]  when I was too low to actually help. We just got lucky we didn't lose the game off that shit.
[24732.09s -> 24751.29s]  Kind of does suck though. Zaya's really strong now. Not bad. I should have, oh I should have,
[24752.09s -> 24758.96s]  I could have killed her. I suppose I could have killed the guy. No joke, I totally could
[24758.96s -> 24763.88s]  could have killed him. If I had warded the lantern as he tried to take it I
[24763.88s -> 24779.20s]  would have killed the Xayah because she egoed the lantern there. She egoed the
[24779.20s -> 24784.32s]  lantern so hard. If I had if I had warded it she dies there. That's my bad.
[24784.32s -> 24800.06s]  This game's really interesting because the enemy bot lane is actually
[24800.06s -> 24804.16s]  misplaying a lot. Like they're they're really really really misplaying
[24804.16s -> 24811.84s]  these fights and trades and shit but uh we can't abuse it because the graves has so much
[24811.84s -> 24815.96s]  control of the game right now that we have to basically play safe permanently at the
[24815.96s -> 24820.16s]  moment and i can't do anything to help my team it feels really bad
[24820.16s -> 24838.68s]  you want my kaisa game yeah there we go see look graves has bought again man this is
[24838.68s -> 24866.56s]  so rough graves is min i want to kill this as fast as i can we can fight these guys
[24866.56s -> 24884.10s]  2v2 actually. Wait, why didn't he just go in? I don't know why he didn't just W immediately.
[24884.74s -> 24890.50s]  Like the Rakan waited. Oh, that tilts me. Like when she was against the wall here, he should have
[24890.50s -> 24898.98s]  immediately W'd her. Because if he W's from vision there, right, and she's against the wall,
[24899.54s -> 24904.50s]  it helps us so much. Because then I can overlay my flame chomps on top of the...
[24904.50s -> 24910.58s]  I can overlay my flame chomps directly on top of the Xayah right as the fights
[24910.58s -> 24914.98s]  happening rather than like having to work around the fight because Thresh is
[24914.98s -> 24922.16s]  in my face type shit you know so we're just we're honestly just losing because
[24922.16s -> 24927.32s]  we're not pulling the trigger fast enough and we can't play aggressive
[24927.32s -> 24932.28s]  when we can pull the trigger right like we're losing because we can't pull
[24932.28s -> 24935.04s]  the trigger fast enough and when we can pull the trigger it's the wrong
[24935.04s -> 24950.13s]  time we do this right now we get dragon the bot lane back do we get dragon here i want to go uh
[24951.33s -> 24963.40s]  i actually want to go with the enemy bot lane didn't back okay they're trolling they lost
[24963.40s -> 24967.40s]  an objective for free here this is really good so the enemy bot lane we fight this by the way
[24967.40s -> 24981.70s]  we just we can just straight up fight that right there is how you lantern are you immortal
[24981.70s -> 25001.99s]  lantern by the way oh i did that guy so dirty oh i'm dead bye guys i didn't know pantheon was
[25001.99s -> 25010.18s]  mia that was my bad i was like going i was too happy with warding the lantern my bad
[25015.30s -> 25023.75s]  i can't believe the enemy team greeted that hard though for gold well that's actually nuts
[25023.75s -> 25039.48s]  to me no yeah the the ziya's egoing like crazy the problem is i can't abuse it constantly because
[25039.48s -> 25046.52s]  like obviously like i need teammates right i can kind of abuse it like uh but it's much harder
[25047.16s -> 25055.11s]  by yourself because as you can see like i'm not playing poorly but we're getting like
[25056.23s -> 25081.25s]  we're getting shit on shit on is a bad word we're getting like oh come on man they missed
[25081.25s -> 25089.91s]  played that so badly but Rakan just ate the fucking whatever I'm not gonna blame
[25089.91s -> 25094.11s]  Rakan it's fine I'm still sad about that though they misplayed that so
[25094.11s -> 25100.55s]  incredibly badly like so badly it was just that like Rakan all-in to the
[25100.55s -> 25105.81s]  Thresh with his ultimate but all he had to do there was uh use his E to come
[25105.81s -> 25109.51s]  back to me and then play front to back afterward but he's to see he sat
[25109.51s -> 25113.11s]  there autoing the Thresh but you don't need to auto him you just need
[25113.11s -> 25121.21s]  to engage and then I can maybe play after it. I probably could have double
[25121.21s -> 25129.40s]  killed them there too. I kind of messed up. My team wants out. It's not it's it's
[25129.40s -> 25136.57s]  silly because the game's not even over. Like we actually can win this game so
[25136.57s -> 25141.89s]  incredibly easily. So easily if we just play it correctly. Because their
[25141.89s -> 25146.41s]  bot lane is really fucking bad. I didn't want to be mean but I'll just be
[25146.41s -> 25158.20s]  mean their bot lane is really fucking bad. Well, I'm dead. They're still bad.
[25160.20s -> 25166.76s]  I'm just ego-ing. That was my ego. I still stand by it. I still think they're bad.
[25167.72s -> 25171.08s]  This guy's just playing 1v3 mid. The Thresh has not been mid one time.
[25171.72s -> 25181.47s]  So it must be the top laner. I'm, I am so frustrated right now with this game
[25185.82s -> 25189.50s]  because I feel like we should have won so many all-ins that we didn't win barely,
[25189.50s -> 25194.54s]  Like one like barely right like barely didn't win small ends. I thought we should have won all of them
[25196.86s -> 25200.70s]  Like they they didn't land like a good all-in once thresh didn't land a single hook once
[25202.70s -> 25204.70s]  And this is my rakan like he just tried to
[25205.10s -> 25207.42s]  He just used his r to try and engage
[25213.28s -> 25215.44s]  I think nocturne is done mentally
[25219.37s -> 25221.37s]  Okay, so in games like this
[25223.31s -> 25247.93s]  Like this thresh is so bad
[25248.17s -> 25250.17s]  Oh, let's go, baby
[25250.65s -> 25252.17s]  Huge
[25252.17s -> 25257.40s]  That was so huge. Let's fucking go
[25275.08s -> 25280.90s]  Like I I'm gonna hit no at 15 because dude, I really don't want to lose to this Thresh and Nasaya
[25282.46s -> 25286.78s]  Like this Thresh is doing the most the most ego shit I've ever seen and
[25287.86s -> 25292.66s]  He's just getting away with shit like right there Thresh walks up whiffs every spell
[25294.06s -> 25299.98s]  And expects to get away with that shit. Nah, no, no, we win these we win these trust give me let me cook
[25299.98s -> 25303.42s]  Let me cook. I just need my team to let me cook a bit, you know
[25304.54s -> 25308.94s]  Like we had a bad early game had to play weak side. Let me cook. Let me cook
[25310.46s -> 25343.60s]  We are chilling
[25343.60s -> 25384.68s]  If I landed that that would have been sick. The rest is top two. We can kill this guy. Come on guys. Don't forfeit
[25385.32s -> 25387.64s]  Guys, the game is winnable. Oh my god
[25388.92s -> 25397.36s]  Dude, the game is how is the Rakan gonna forfeit dude? That game is so winnable. It hurts
[25398.40s -> 25407.44s]  Oh, like, dude, really?
[25407.44s -> 25413.42s]  That actually is so infuriating.
[25413.42s -> 25415.72s]  That's so infuriating, man.
[25415.72s -> 25418.44s]  That game was so incredibly winnable.
[25418.44s -> 25421.81s]  Like, look at this.
[25421.81s -> 25423.75s]  I did more damage than every single player
[25423.75s -> 25424.71s]  on the enemy team.
[25425.61s -> 25428.97s]  If my team just relaxed,
[25428.97s -> 25433.27s]  we win the game a thousand times over that game.
[25433.27s -> 25434.53s]  Like, the game is over.
[25434.53s -> 25440.81s]  We have a Rakan, a Rumble, and a Wukong for me to sit behind.
[25440.81s -> 25443.35s]  And we saw how bad their bot lane was, right?
[25443.35s -> 25448.31s]  I have Quens for the only way they can kill me.
[25448.31s -> 25450.39s]  I wish to god I'm gonna report them all.
[25450.39s -> 25453.45s]  These fuckers, I guarantee I get a notification.
[25453.45s -> 25457.68s]  There's no way these people are not toxic.
[25457.68s -> 25462.16s]  There's no way you just want out of the game after a fucking...
[25462.16s -> 25464.48s]  Your team is just doing well.
[25464.48s -> 25466.40s]  Nah, man.
[25466.40s -> 25471.40s]  The score is 10 to 14, 10 to 14.
[25474.08s -> 25481.54s]  You have a fed 80 carry.
[25481.54s -> 25488.50s]  Look at this, dude, we forfeited, we were down 2.5K.
[25488.50s -> 25491.70s]  We had a better scaling comp than them.
[25491.70s -> 25493.18s]  Like we outscaled them.
[25494.98s -> 25498.86s]  We have two dragons, we outscale them
[25498.86s -> 25501.62s]  and we're down 2.5K.
[25501.62s -> 25518.30s]  and my team rage hits forfeit oh my god that's so gross that is so disgusting so
[25518.30s -> 25533.86s]  disgusting why am I in a game with this player I'm 412 LP Masters I was in a
[25533.86s -> 25541.78s]  game just now with a 7 LP Masters jungler and he's not on a smurf this
[25541.78s -> 25549.57s]  This is not a smurf account, because last season this guy was D4.
[25549.57s -> 25551.49s]  So he's not on a smurf.
[25551.49s -> 25556.52s]  Why is this player in my game?
[25556.52s -> 25561.04s]  Why is this player in a 400 LP master game?
[25561.04s -> 25562.16s]  Why?
[25562.16s -> 25569.85s]  Or rather why am I in a Diamond 1 game?
[25569.85s -> 25572.65s]  You can go to his previous games, he doesn't even have good MMR.
[25572.65s -> 25578.39s]  Like if you look at these games, they're all like what, 100, 200 LP right?
[25578.39s -> 25579.69s]  Why am I in this game?
[25579.69s -> 25583.33s]  Why did you put me in a game with this player?
[25583.33s -> 25587.49s]  Like this guy, I don't even care if he sucks, I'm more frustrated at the fact that these
[25587.49s -> 25593.09s]  players mental boom at the first sign of any negativity, look at this.
[25593.09s -> 25594.21s]  They just give up.
[25594.21s -> 25598.05s]  First sign of anything negative, they go next.
[25598.05s -> 25601.61s]  Like I actually could have 1v9'd this game too, like actually.
[25601.61s -> 25605.13s]  But I'm not allowed to try and 1v9 because my team wants out of the game at fucking
[25605.13s -> 25607.93s]  four minutes, or fifteen minutes.
[25607.93s -> 25610.73s]  That sucks man.
[25610.73s -> 25613.13s]  The new system is trash.
[25613.13s -> 25617.29s]  I'm sorry, but the the forfeit 15 system is good. Sometimes
[25618.09s -> 25622.85s]  They should have a requirement that you have to be losing by X amount of gold for it to kick in
[25623.65s -> 25625.65s]  That should that should be it
[25625.65s -> 25627.37s]  They should have a requirement
[25627.37s -> 25630.87s]  You have to be losing by 5k plus for it to work at 15
[25633.98s -> 25635.98s]  Like there needs to be something
[25636.46s -> 25640.46s]  Where there's a requirement because people are so stupid
[25640.46s -> 25647.78s]  Right like that game was a hundred percent ours. We had two dragons. We're down 2,000 gold at 16 minutes and
[25648.82s -> 25658.22s]  Wukong's three and one we were done four kills Wukong's three and one I'm I'm literally
[25659.06s -> 25661.06s]  insanely strong
[25661.18s -> 25665.30s]  Even though we got weak side. I'm still winning. We just to be to them bots out of the map, right?
[25665.30s -> 25667.30s]  We just want to be to
[25668.42s -> 25670.42s]  Rumbles just like get like, ah
[25670.94s -> 25672.94s]  Sorry, I'm just mad. I'm mad
[25673.82s -> 25680.70s]  Like they need to require they need to require something other than four people like require four people and a gold lead or something
[25680.70s -> 25684.86s]  Like that's so cancer
[25684.86s -> 25686.86s]  That's so fucking frustrating, man
[25689.36s -> 25691.60s]  Like I can't believe how bad people's mentals are
[25693.04s -> 25699.44s]  Like the okay, I get it the the rumble and the the rumble in the nocturne. I understand wanting to forfeit. Okay
[25700.00s -> 25703.84s]  Okay, they're having a bad game. They want out they're raging. They need to get their frustration. I get it
[25704.24s -> 25709.02s]  But why are we forfeiting?
[25709.02s -> 25717.02s]  When Wukong is 3-1, I have 7 of our KP, I'm the AD carry, I'm very strong, I just got my Mythic.
[25717.02s -> 25719.02s]  We have 2 Dragons.
[25719.02s -> 25723.02s]  And Rakan's forfeiting 2, I don't know man.
[25726.02s -> 25728.02s]  That's just frustrating is all.
[25728.02s -> 25736.34s]  Like, I'll be real, I carry this game every day of the week.
[25736.34s -> 25739.34s]  Like every day of the week I carry those.
[25739.34s -> 25768.17s]  So apparently Riot is doing something about smurfing though.
[25768.17s -> 25774.81s]  though. And I can't wait until they do. This is actually a really good thing that I wanted
[25774.81s -> 25778.81s]  that I wanted to talk about earlier in the stream, but I forgot. Apparently Riot is like
[25778.81s -> 25782.89s]  doing something to make smurfing harder because like, apparently smurfing is outrageous right
[25782.89s -> 25790.09s]  now. And I kind of think that they need to stop this too. So there's a there's a thing
[25790.09s -> 25796.81s]  you can do in solo queue right now, where you can make a new account. And you can duo
[25796.81s -> 25804.29s]  with somebody on different accounts on a new account and your MMR doesn't actually get
[25804.29s -> 25816.77s]  like lowered. So if you win a game, let's say you win a game. I think this is just him
[25816.77s -> 25823.58s]  blabbering the account. But let's say let's say you win a game. And in that game, you
[25823.58s -> 25828.34s]  do with somebody in a lower MMR, right? Now when you do in a lower MMR, I don't
[25828.34s -> 25830.90s]  know if this guy did this or not, but when you deal with somebody in a lower
[25830.90s -> 25837.10s]  MMR, your MMR is based on now the game thinks that you're in that MMR and you
[25837.10s -> 25841.26s]  can do it in placements. So in your very first games, for some reason,
[25841.44s -> 25847.34s]  there's no MMR lock on placements. So you can in your placements, do it with
[25847.34s -> 25852.62s]  somebody who's like bronze, right? And you can play with them. And then the
[25852.62s -> 25857.62s]  game thinks you're still winning. So it keeps amplifying your MMR. So when
[25857.62s -> 25862.18s]  I'm describing this really poorly, but essentially you can duo in lower elos, and the game doesn't
[25862.18s -> 25868.10s]  know your MMR belongs in that elo because you're winning in that elo. The game can't figure that
[25868.10s -> 25874.58s]  out for some reason, the algorithm. So when they stop duo queuing, it still inflated them,
[25875.14s -> 25879.62s]  it still inflated their MMR to where it would be if they had solo queued. Does that make
[25879.62s -> 25884.34s]  sense? And what I'm saying? So it basically says that they went like 10 and 0 in their
[25884.34s -> 25889.82s]  placements right so now they're in like a master tier MMR from a brand new
[25889.82s -> 25895.26s]  account so now those people are in like D1 masters MMR but they played they they
[25895.26s -> 25906.63s]  won in gold I also don't think you smurfing should be so easily accessible
[25906.63s -> 25913.37s]  like this guy's not a bad player per se but I don't think he's a master
[25913.37s -> 25917.97s]  tier player right like this guy's a rumble player on a new account I from
[25917.97s -> 25940.79s]  From that game alone, the fact he gave up tells me he's not a good player.
[25940.79s -> 25949.31s]  I'm a heavy advocate for Riot having to attach verification to your accounts.
[25949.31s -> 25953.85s]  I know Riot would never do that, but I'm a heavy advocate for having to attach verification
[25953.85s -> 25957.47s]  to play ranked.
[25957.47s -> 25961.86s]  I think it would be great.
[25961.86s -> 25975.21s]  I think it would help so much.
[25975.21s -> 25977.29s]  If you get your verification account banned, are you done for it?
[25977.29s -> 25978.29s]  Yeah.
[25978.29s -> 25981.17s]  You have to get a VPN to play.
[25981.17s -> 25983.93s]  That's my point though.
[25983.93s -> 25989.81s]  If you get your verified account banned, that account's done.
[25989.81s -> 26011.90s]  Like I said, I don't think Riot would ever do it because it's too extreme and I don't
[26011.90s -> 26014.10s]  think Riot has the balls to ever do that shit.
[26014.10s -> 26015.90s]  VPN's only $5.
[26015.90s -> 26019.98s]  Yeah, but dude, are you gonna tell me that you're gonna buy it?
[26019.98s -> 26023.70s]  People who get banned on accounts typically get banned consistently.
[26023.70s -> 26026.30s]  That's why they're making Smurfs.
[26026.30s -> 26032.82s]  So you're telling me somebody's gonna be willing to pay five dollars for a new phone number verification or whatever
[26033.74s -> 26036.34s]  Every time they have to make a new account. They're not
[26047.14s -> 26048.82s]  Not you me
[26048.82s -> 26050.82s]  Lulu. Yeah. Yeah. Okay
[26051.26s -> 26053.26s]  Don't I have smurfs? Yeah, I do
[26053.90s -> 26058.60s]  And I stand by all my smurfs should be attached to the same like account
[26059.30s -> 26063.14s]  Like if you make a smurf, okay, this is what I think should happen
[26063.14s -> 26067.14s]  You should be able to put all of your Smurfs on one account.
[26067.14s -> 26072.14s]  So you can make Smurfs and you can add that Smurf verification to an account.
[26072.14s -> 26075.14s]  But it kind of like battle.net.
[26075.14s -> 26076.14s]  Does that make sense?
[26076.14s -> 26079.14s]  You know, like battle.net has all your accounts in the battle.net thing,
[26079.14s -> 26081.14s]  but you can sign into battle.net.
[26081.14s -> 26086.14s]  I think that the way to make it viable would be like you could put all
[26086.14s -> 26089.14s]  if you didn't have a second phone number, didn't want one,
[26089.14s -> 26091.14s]  you could put Smurfs up to like a limit.
[26091.14s -> 26094.98s]  a limit. So you can have like three smurfs or like two smurfs in your main account. Right?
[26094.98s -> 26099.70s]  So you could have like three total accounts. And you you would have to like you could add those
[26099.70s -> 26105.22s]  to the same like omega account. Right. And that omega account could be your verified account.
[26105.22s -> 26110.02s]  Now if any of your accounts get punished on your omega account, all of your accounts get
[26110.02s -> 26130.10s]  punished. So if any of your accounts get punished, all of them get punished. Like I
[26130.10s -> 26134.18s]  feel like that'd be a good play. Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like it would work. Yo,
[26134.18s -> 26135.42s]  Yo, what's up, Rush?
[26135.42s -> 26141.47s]  I called you Rush, what's up, Ruff?
[26141.47s -> 26142.59s]  What do I wanna play?
[26143.67s -> 26144.51s]  I don't know.
[26145.39s -> 26149.00s]  I don't know what I wanna do here.
[26149.00s -> 26151.28s]  Self-arranged, okay.
[26151.28s -> 26152.60s]  I wish I didn't have cleanse.
[26152.60s -> 26155.20s]  Cleanse is so worthless, this game, like, actually.
[26156.72s -> 26159.40s]  Cleanse does nothing, this game, at all.
[26159.40s -> 26160.80s]  I'm just down a sum.
[26160.80s -> 26162.16s]  Like, maybe if the brand, like,
[26162.16s -> 26164.48s]  tries to flash-stun me or some shit,
[26164.48s -> 26178.98s]  but I'm just, like, down a summoner.
[26178.98s -> 26180.74s]  All right, boys.
[26180.74s -> 26182.80s]  We got Nightblue3 on our team.
[26185.77s -> 26186.61s]  This is a throwback.
[26248.01s -> 26248.31s]  Damn.
[26249.19s -> 26249.79s]  Oh, we got him.
[26256.18s -> 26256.86s]  I'm not going to lie.
[26256.88s -> 26258.40s]  I kind of looked like I was scripting.
[26260.38s -> 26262.82s]  That, that movement, like if I was watching the game, I'd be like,
[26262.82s -> 26264.16s]  what the fuck was that?
[26266.18s -> 26271.18s]  Like my movement was real sus on that, like that, that all in right there.
[26271.18s -> 26273.80s]  That's some, that's some, that's some sus movement.
[26305.85s -> 26306.85s]  We can gank these guys.
[26306.85s -> 26308.69s]  They have no, oh, there's going to be a ward in here.
[26309.07s -> 26324.78s]  These people have no flashes enemy bot lane has no flash. This should be be a free kill honestly
[26326.12s -> 26329.96s]  We just let these guys push in they can't walk up and we just play for that
[26334.84s -> 26347.79s]  Even if they try in 3v3, we should just win the 3v3 because we're stronger. Oh, this guy's just dead. Yeah, that's I
[26358.40s -> 26360.40s]  need level 3 I
[26363.08s -> 26365.08s]  Kind of fucked my entire wave here
[26366.08s -> 26391.10s]  Yo, can we push is there any way we can just push this whoo nice nice well played
[26392.56s -> 26394.02s]  Nice job
[26394.02s -> 26408.14s]  My Lulu's fucking fetish shit. Oh, I should have gone free boots this game. I didn't think about it
[26409.82s -> 26414.60s]  Cuz uh, I don't need sork this game, you know, I was like the last game
[26414.60s -> 26417.12s]  I told you I was going boots. I went boots for the
[26417.12s -> 26424.00s]  uh you know the fast boot to rush for thresh i don't need that this game because we just
[26424.00s -> 26432.88s]  went through like faster mythic so i should have gone free boots for like more efficiency
[26440.16s -> 26448.72s]  can't understand and i could just kill a man you can't understand i could just kill a man
[26448.72s -> 26470.27s]  I want to push this wave
[26470.99s -> 26472.99s]  So we don't get like shit on
[26500.29s -> 26502.29s]  Just kill a man
[26502.73s -> 26504.73s]  You can't understand
[26505.33s -> 26507.33s]  Just kill a man
[26510.97s -> 26514.73s]  Kill a man. There is something you can't understand
[26516.01s -> 26544.25s]  Give a man
[26544.25s -> 26546.25s]  mmm, I could go back here, but I
[26546.93s -> 26559.52s]  Don't see any reason to go back yet. I think I'm dead. Oh
[26559.52s -> 26565.58s]  I
[26565.86s -> 26569.36s]  Misplayed that that was actually really good by Lulu cooldowns. No, you're fine, man
[26569.36s -> 26574.70s]  I wish I could I wish I could tell him that he played it fine. I messed up not him. I messed up. I
[26576.88s -> 26579.12s]  Feel bad. I want to like say no, you're fine
[26579.72s -> 26585.65s]  Cuz that was my bad. I
[26585.77s -> 26586.65s]  Should have okay
[26586.65s -> 26591.09s]  So when I flashed and I was running away from the twitch right the second that twitch flashed on me
[26591.09s -> 26593.09s]  I should have instantly started autoing him
[26593.29s -> 26598.55s]  Like I and it was one extra auto like one single extra auto and it would have been fine
[26599.05s -> 26607.90s]  Why can't I tell her? You know, I just choose not to type anymore
[26608.70s -> 26610.30s]  It's my choice
[26610.30s -> 26620.57s]  You know, yeah my choice
[26639.58s -> 26641.58s]  Guys actually doing that, huh? Oh
[26642.10s -> 26646.31s]  We win to be too really fucking hard
[26647.67s -> 26649.67s]  Especially with tier two boots, but I need a
[26650.67s -> 26668.16s]  Dude, I'm doing some scripty shit. I don't be real
[26669.04s -> 26678.84s]  Dude Lulu wasn't six. I thought she was six. I'm so bad. I
[26678.84s -> 26685.10s]  I wish I could tell her my bad again. I'm actually trolling
[26686.14s -> 26689.88s]  like I ran out of mana because I'm bad and then I
[26690.74s -> 26699.02s]  and then I thought she was six so I walked up to like take tank the turret for a second right because I was like
[26699.02s -> 26702.08s]  Oh shit, maybe I'll get like maybe we can kill this guy. Maybe Lulu has a spell or something
[26702.08s -> 26704.48s]  I just oh I played bad my bad
[26710.50s -> 26713.20s]  W that make sure Akira's not there. I
[26718.21s -> 26721.49s]  Feel I actually just feel so bad because the Lulu is actually playing really
[26721.49s -> 26723.49s]  There's like the best support I've had all day
[26723.49s -> 26725.49s]  Like this guy's actually impressing me, right?
[26725.85s -> 26727.85s]  Like this guy's playing really well
[26727.97s -> 26761.90s]  And I'm just griefing Lulu gave her life for me
[26765.62s -> 26767.62s]  Lulu gave her life for me boys
[26769.48s -> 26772.36s]  Can we get a a salute for Lulu and chat boys?
[26773.44s -> 26774.96s]  Do we get a salute?
[26774.96s -> 26778.78s]  Can we get some love for Lulu?
[26779.90s -> 26806.87s]  She gave her life for the homie honestly, that was a really cool to be too by the way
[26806.87s -> 26829.89s]  Oh night was smurfing it what the fuck you'll kill that bitch too nice
[26839.99s -> 26841.99s]  No, oh
[26843.07s -> 26845.07s]  But lost that cannon I would have lost my life
[26846.27s -> 26876.53s]  in-game
[26876.53s -> 26879.17s]  I'm gonna go BT second item. We have Lulu
[26879.77s -> 26881.85s]  so wait, what the fuck is this pathing I
[26883.29s -> 26886.33s]  Click to go bot and it passed me in the weirdest spot ever we have Lulu
[26886.33s -> 26891.41s]  So I could actually go IE second, but I think if I go BT, I'll be actually unkillable
[26892.65s -> 26894.91s]  Like it'll be the greatest thing ever. I
[26897.14s -> 26901.76s]  Actually still might go IE as I'm thinking about it out loud by saying we have Lulu and not be stupid
[26901.76s -> 26906.36s]  But hey, I guess don't might you know, I still might go IE, but I don't know yet
[26906.36s -> 26909.10s]  We'll see cuz I took a lacquer D. So it's like
[26910.28s -> 26925.11s]  Wow
[26925.11s -> 26950.94s]  No, I'm gonna die. I mean, I don't know why I flashed away
[26953.20s -> 26955.60s]  I'm playing bad. It's my fault.
[26957.28s -> 26961.60s]  I think the game's over, so I'm just- I'm playing bad. I'm like, limit testing a little bit too much.
[26972.65s -> 26973.13s]  Today!
[27023.95s -> 27029.16s]  Nightblue, help! Help! Help!
[27045.45s -> 27057.29s]  I'm surprised they haven't forward put it, though. What the fuck?
[27057.93s -> 27063.05s]  Dude, how does this game- Oh, I'm even more mad. You guys have no idea.
[27064.13s -> 27066.13s]  So I
[27066.69s -> 27073.87s]  It's 24 to 8 the enemy team doesn't forfeit but my team forfeits when the score is 10 to 14
[27074.89s -> 27077.77s]  And we're only down a thousand golds
[27095.43s -> 27097.07s]  Sorry, I was
[27097.07s -> 27099.07s]  That was my bad. I was tilted by
[27099.87s -> 27105.46s]  You know, I was thinking about about how they weren't forfeiting and I was getting mad
[27106.94s -> 27109.62s]  It is a little interesting cuz like I said, they still can't win
[27109.62s -> 27115.04s]  So I don't know who the fuck's hitting no, but it's probably echo. Well, no, I goes definitely heading no, but like who else
[27116.90s -> 27123.47s]  Maybe brand maybe ribbon. Hey ribbons like yeah
[27124.03s -> 27133.64s]  They just get a thousand gold. All right, I should probably stop trolling
[27134.16s -> 27141.62s]  I'd feel pretty silly if we lost cuz I'm bad after we like dumpstered him in lane that art
[27141.62s -> 27144.14s]  I feel pretty silly if we lost cuz I keep getting caught
[27144.66s -> 27163.52s]  All right, I should be unkillable now
[27163.68s -> 27168.10s]  Like I'm not even farming. I'm actually griefing. I
[27168.10s -> 27173.02s]  I should probably go make dinner after this game. I want to keep playing because I'm playing well today
[27173.02s -> 27177.54s]  But like dude, my brain is starting to go like I probably need to go make some food
[27178.14s -> 27196.15s]  I'm getting the full ADHD brain experience going. So let's see if I can muster all my focus
[27196.75s -> 27203.49s]  Let's see if I can muster up all my focus really quick just for
[27204.21s -> 27206.01s]  Push out and finish this game
[27206.01s -> 27215.15s]  We'll go Terminator mode for the the end of this game right now. We'll muster up all of the all of the focus
[27224.13s -> 27227.19s]  Demon mode engaged voice god that sounded really cringe
[27227.85s -> 27283.44s]  I'm actually really impressed though night blue played this game really really well like I'll be honest
[27283.98s -> 27287.82s]  My last like thought of night blue was him being bad at League
[27289.24s -> 27291.54s]  He played this game really well
[27292.20s -> 27296.79s]  My man's gotten so much better
[27297.15s -> 27308.52s]  Okay, nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that
[27308.52s -> 27312.88s]  that nobody saw that nobody saw that not one of you saw me flash after the
[27312.88s -> 27325.16s]  Ekko ult did not one of you wasted flash no that was assertive flash an
[27325.16s -> 27337.00s]  assertive dominant flash not wasted at all they might actually go for Baron
[27337.00s -> 27350.22s]  here we should look for this like they could try oh he's here pretty sure the
[27350.22s -> 27357.48s]  Riven's here too though. Yep. I did not mean to do that. I didn't mean to hit the
[27357.48s -> 27362.00s]  thing I accidentally hit the blast plants. That was that was an accident. It
[27362.00s -> 27369.99s]  was a it was a literal pure accident. Like I I did not mean to hit it. I was
[27369.99s -> 27374.25s]  like I know Riven's here. I'm gonna wait for Yasuo before I go over or
[27374.25s -> 27377.61s]  before I do this right and I'm gonna bait him and I just completely whiffed
[27377.61s -> 27381.31s]  every like I'm bad. We'll leave it at I'm bad. That's a good way to put it.
[27381.31s -> 27385.71s]  I'm bad. I'm hungry. I'm old. I'm bald. I'm bad. Nothing else to say
[27386.91s -> 27388.91s]  short to short mad
[27402.61s -> 27405.15s]  Yeah, that was a pedestrian flash
[27406.37s -> 27418.06s]  It is she as well. Oh, yeah, it's it's a plethora a plethora of terrible things. I still got to go to the gym tonight, too
[27442.79s -> 27444.43s]  Zeds bought
[27444.43s -> 27445.75s]  Okay
[27445.75s -> 27447.99s]  I'm a little nervous of like getting flanked
[27449.15s -> 27451.15s]  Right there junglers could just like sit in places
[27452.09s -> 27473.34s]  Nice we got top and him not bad. Yeah, I mean we just try and get mid and hip here
[27475.22s -> 27477.22s]  Well, let's go help our homie though
[27477.76s -> 27500.58s]  Like I'm actually so sad. I'm playing so bad
[27501.88s -> 27506.60s]  Like I was playing so good at the start and now I'm playing so bad. It actually makes me sad. I
[27516.03s -> 27518.03s]  Was tanking for that guy?
[27518.23s -> 27538.73s]  All right, let's just leave. I
[27538.73s -> 27544.53s]  Don't want to I don't want to throw the game for my my teammates because like I'm getting like, you know
[27544.53s -> 27583.02s]  I've already died five times like a dipshit. Oh, where'd he go? We should just push bot honestly
[27584.66s -> 27586.50s]  We don't even need this dragon
[27586.50s -> 27597.94s]  Fuck it. We just I'm just gonna push bot
[27643.94s -> 27658.62s]  Not bad
[27658.62s -> 27663.28s]  Not bad at all. I gotta give it. I want to give it to night blue, but I gotta give it to this Lulu
[27664.28s -> 27671.29s]  Lulu played that game so good. I gotta give it to Lulu. She played so fucking good
[27676.04s -> 27693.57s]  Like actually I don't even know if she's still in here
[27712.58s -> 27721.91s]  I'm not a scripter
[27721.95s -> 27723.95s]  She thinks I'm a no, I'm serious
[27732.59s -> 27734.59s]  She thinks I'm a scripter
[27739.20s -> 27758.70s]  Bro, I'm streaming
[27758.86s -> 27760.98s]  Dude the homie thought I'm a scripter
[27761.74s -> 27766.66s]  You know, I'll take it my ego feels good
[27776.09s -> 27778.09s]  Honestly, that feels good. That feels good
[27778.53s -> 27780.01s]  Hi, well
[27780.01s -> 27786.06s]  Thought I was a scripted dude. I'm not gonna lie though
[27786.26s -> 27789.42s]  Some of those movements were sus as fuck that I was making
[27789.90s -> 27797.00s]  Like I was I like I like turned on the fucking mental scripts for that game. Some of those movements early were nuts
[27799.62s -> 27801.78s]  Like like just like this tiny little
[27802.50s -> 27806.06s]  Tiny little movements. I was doing early game and lane were crazy
[27806.42s -> 27816.63s]  Like look at this watch this like this movement right here, right? Like look I dodged that right?
[27816.63s -> 27832.70s]  Then I walk up, cleanse the thing, kite down, like that, that movement is gross man, look.
[27832.70s -> 27836.50s]  That was actually some gross ass movement, I'm not gonna lie.
[27836.50s -> 27838.38s]  Look at this.
[27838.38s -> 27843.66s]  In the corner man, in the corner.
[27843.66s -> 27851.94s]  My brain was like, yo Andromeda, thank you man, yo you played really good.
[27851.94s -> 27856.06s]  Now I felt bad, I felt so bad because I was griefing.
[27856.06s -> 27861.66s]  I was like at the start of the game. We were just snow like I literally fucked up like three times
[27862.50s -> 27865.08s]  During like the really important fights and I was like, oh no
[27865.70s -> 27873.58s]  Yeah, thank you the bits. Can I play Kalista? I can
[27874.18s -> 27881.99s]  I'm trying to figure out if I want to play a Kalista game or if I want to go make dinner
[27888.75s -> 27894.97s]  There was one other movement that I thought was kind of nuts. I did a really good movement to somewhere. I don't remember what it was
[27898.26s -> 27901.08s]  Here's where I fucked up. So right now I
[27901.08s -> 27907.00s]  I should have just been I for some reason my brain lagged and I should have just been sitting here. Um, I
[27907.72s -> 27910.28s]  Should have just cleansed and then started fighting the twitch
[27911.12s -> 27914.64s]  For some reason I didn't cleanse but this wasn't like your fault at all
[27914.64s -> 27919.98s]  Like I the second the twitch flashed I should have insta cleansed the ignite and I should have been killing him
[27920.40s -> 27923.28s]  Like right now just like autoing because I can't get away from him, right?
[27923.48s -> 27926.64s]  But it took me an extra second. See I I started fighting him now
[27927.28s -> 27936.13s]  Like I barely died. I wouldn't have died had I cleansed and had I just turned initially it was fine
[27936.99s -> 27946.34s]  And then like here I fucked up too because I went in and I thought we were six. Oh
[27954.38s -> 27956.38s]  I could have killed that guy. I
[27957.02s -> 27960.76s]  Should have gone forward one more. Oh, you know what? I should have done there
[27960.76s -> 27965.82s]  I should have gone forward one more auto killed this guy Lulu would have gotten six off of the kill
[27965.82s -> 27969.70s]  I would have used my speed to come back out then she could have ulted me
[27969.70s -> 27974.34s]  We could have killed the uh, we could have got the twitch and then we could have turned on this echo, too
[27981.76s -> 27984.08s]  Oh, this was a really cool 2v2
[27985.60s -> 27987.60s]  I actually thought this 2v2 was really sick
[27992.61s -> 27996.69s]  Lulu's a real one for this man. Listen, you're a real one for this one
[27997.57s -> 27999.57s]  You just took the death to save me
[28004.64s -> 28006.48s]  respect
[28006.48s -> 28012.85s]  You're a real one for that
[28012.85s -> 28019.49s]  That was so good
[28019.49s -> 28022.53s]  Jesus was fun. Yeah, jeez. You were the best support i've had today
[28022.93s -> 28028.37s]  Like legitimately you played better than all the other players in the sealer. That was really good. Like I was surprised
[28028.37s -> 28033.73s]  I was telling my stream. I was like, yeah, this she's actually like they I said she because you're a little I don't know
[28033.73s -> 28035.73s]  You know, but I was like, yeah
[28036.01s -> 28039.49s]  She's playing super good. She's playing way better than all of my fucking teammates
[28044.34s -> 28046.10s]  Yo
[28046.10s -> 28048.10s]  What time is it? It's 6
[28048.42s -> 28052.46s]  Man, do I want to do I want to keep streaming or do I want to go to or do I want to go get?
[28052.46s -> 28058.04s]  food and go to the gym. I can't like 24 hour fitness is not
[28058.04s -> 28061.96s]  actually 24 anymore. So I'd have to go soon if I'm going to go
[28061.96s -> 28081.98s]  to the gym. But it is only like six. Hmm. But I could just
[28081.98s -> 28087.38s]  end on I could just end on hitting the like 400 lp mark
[28087.38s -> 28092.79s]  and just chill for now. Right? Like we have 400 lp we'll
[28092.79s -> 28097.23s]  probably hit GM tomorrow. So I could just chill for now
[28097.23s -> 28105.15s]  then we can just hit GM tomorrow. That's probably a better idea because then I won't get mad like say
[28105.15s -> 28111.31s]  say we get like like say we get another game like this right like say we get another game like this
[28111.31s -> 28115.39s]  where like we're literally winning the game and my team's like no let's forfeit like that's
[28115.39s -> 28119.87s]  gonna make me mad I was mad this is gonna make me mad right like I so I'd rather just like
[28119.87s -> 28130.82s]  get off on a good note like a happy note you know like not be tilted GM tomorrow yeah I hope
[28130.82s -> 28135.38s]  So I've been I think I can get challenger back this year, but we got to get to GM first
[28135.98s -> 28140.86s]  I'm telling you I this elo is so miserable like master tier is
[28141.54s -> 28148.18s]  The worst elo I've ever played in in my 12 years of playing this game
[28149.42s -> 28153.30s]  whatever NA 300 400 LP masters is is
[28154.38s -> 28155.50s]  literally
[28155.50s -> 28163.12s]  Disgusting these these are not real people like I feel like half these games. We are playing with NPCs
[28164.68s -> 28169.86s]  Who quite literally don't even like I don't even know what to say other bots and
[28170.48s -> 28175.32s]  They can't be real humans. They get mad over nothing. They rage quit over nothing
[28175.32s -> 28178.46s]  They they they give up at 15 minutes when we're winning the game
[28178.96s -> 28180.96s]  These cannot be real people
[28180.96s -> 28188.29s]  So I swear to God the game has to get better in GM. It has to get better
[28188.75s -> 28191.67s]  There's no world that it gets worse
[28192.85s -> 28194.85s]  Like I refuse to believe that
[28195.75s -> 28203.76s]  Because this is this is the worst grind I've ever had is it bad to be a bot
[28204.20s -> 28208.23s]  Are you saying I'm botist?
[28208.23s -> 28214.82s]  Are we gonna cancel me because I because I because I don't like bots. I said it I'm saying it
[28214.82s -> 28216.82s]  I don't like fucking bots. Well
[28216.82s -> 28221.22s]  Okay, I didn't need to add fuck it. You know what? We're just gonna I'm gonna get off. I'm gonna yeah, that's it
[28221.22s -> 28222.84s]  That's it for me
[28222.84s -> 28228.64s]  I'm gonna get off voice. I'm tired. I need to go to the gym before I run out of juice make some dinner
[28228.64s -> 28234.44s]  I will be live tomorrow same time as today. I've been starting my stream at 10 a.m. My time
[28235.52s -> 28240.90s]  Maybe I'll do it tomorrow at 9 a.m. I don't know. It's 10 or 9 what between there
[28240.90s -> 28242.90s]  I always start my stream and so
[28242.90s -> 28247.06s]  And that's my time. So it's like seven eight nine PST
[28247.82s -> 28251.62s]  You're good at ad. Thanks, man. I think I suck. My goal is
[28252.62s -> 28259.88s]  Hopefully I can get challenger back and then I'm not gonna play like I just want to my goal is challenger
[28259.88s -> 28261.88s]  So that I can prove to myself
[28262.10s -> 28264.10s]  It's a really stupid thing
[28264.10s -> 28266.80s]  But I want to prove to myself that I can still do it at 32
[28267.26s -> 28270.46s]  Because ten years ago was the first time I started streaming this year, right?
[28270.46s -> 28274.02s]  I've been streaming for 10 years this year, and so I want to get challenger
[28275.10s -> 28279.98s]  Because when I first started streaming I was in challenger and I want to see if like after 10 years I can still do it
[28279.98s -> 28283.42s]  And then I'm never gonna care again
[28284.38s -> 28287.18s]  This will be the only time I ever give a shit about getting challenger
[28287.18s -> 28290.70s]  I just want to get it see if I care and then play for content, you know
[28292.34s -> 28296.56s]  But uh, yeah, it's just it's just like welcome to the league of Draven
[28297.38s -> 28300.82s]  see if the old man who has fucking arthritis and
[28301.54s -> 28305.14s]  Fucking carpal tunnel and all that shit. You know what I mean? See if I can still do it
[28306.78s -> 28309.82s]  Yo, thank you for the twitch prime man. I appreciate it. Thank you so much
[28310.42s -> 28311.90s]  Appreciate it a lot, dude
[28311.90s -> 28313.42s]  Alright guys, that's gonna be it for me
[28313.42s -> 28317.72s]  If you like to stream don't forget to follow all my socials and tik-tok and Facebook and Instagram and all that shits
[28317.74s -> 28320.86s]  All the clickable garbage is underneath the stream. Don't forget to check it out
[28322.06s -> 28324.48s]  I'll be back tomorrow same time in the morning. I
[28325.78s -> 28329.02s]  Tomorrow's my last day for the weekend though. I'm not gonna stream on Saturday
[28329.02s -> 28335.18s]  I might do some off-stream grinding on Saturday. I've been taking I've been like forcing myself to take a day off of streaming
[28335.78s -> 28341.38s]  Every week just so like I can mentally recharge and I think it's actually been really good for my stream
[28341.78s -> 28345.74s]  Because like I've been in a much better mood while streaming and I've been much less tilted and I've been
[28346.74s -> 28350.94s]  Even if I play league off stream or whatever. It's just like it doesn't feel as forced
[28350.94s -> 28355.90s]  So I feel like the breaks nice. So yeah tomorrow no stream on Saturday tomorrow for sure and Sunday
[28355.90s -> 28361.44s]  I might I might do a short stream, but yeah, I'll see you guys then. Thanks for watching. I appreciate you guys and
[28363.78s -> 28370.70s]  Yeah, that's it. I'm gonna go make dinner. Oh, we guys have a good night day wherever the fuck you are
[28371.30s -> 28376.58s]  Later dudes. Hope you guys have a good one. It was fun playing with you Andromeda. Good luck on the games
[28377.30s -> 28379.30s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow. Peace
