[1542.00s -> 1548.80s]  Well rip I was gonna go MF and then I like decided to go Niko and then I just fucked it all up. Oh well. Oh
[1551.28s -> 1553.28s]  Wow
[1560.00s -> 1562.00s]  You

[1643.08s -> 1647.44s]  Sorry, I'm still waking up. Let me give me one sec subscribe. Oh
[1652.00s -> 1654.00s]  You
[1674.56s -> 1676.56s]  Oh, okay. Oh
[1676.56s -> 1678.56s]  Oh
[1679.76s -> 1682.84s]  Yeah, baby, I was gonna play on my man at the start but dude
[1682.84s -> 1687.28s]  I don't know if I can sit through fucking eight minute queue times to get people raging at each other all day
[1687.60s -> 1690.32s]  So we'll we'll do some warm-up on this account for a bit
[1702.32s -> 1705.92s]  What am Mars's count like D1 well master
[1706.56s -> 1708.56s]  I
[1713.28s -> 1719.64s]  Like my other counts like 500 this one's I want to say like I don't know the MMR is really awkward
[1720.56s -> 1723.36s]  When you get like well masters right like the MMR super awkward
[1723.64s -> 1726.36s]  So I don't know what are the amores, but I know it's a little masters
[1726.36s -> 1729.72s]  So like sometimes there's diamonds sometimes there's like hundred LP players
[1731.20s -> 1733.20s]  Some more between there
[1737.12s -> 1739.12s]  Dude, I I
[1741.60s -> 1749.28s]  Played some games off stream yesterday, I got up to like 400 LP then I lost three in a row that shit was painful
[1755.24s -> 1759.16s]  I did into one of tenacity's games though, so that was fun
[1759.76s -> 1761.76s]  That
[1766.20s -> 1768.20s]  Felt bad
[1769.92s -> 1776.16s]  No, yeah, straight up it felt so bad he was doing so good too like I straight up just had a bad game and I felt
[1776.16s -> 1778.16s]  I felt like shit
[1779.36s -> 1782.08s]  Look at this shit I just dropped like eight deaths. Look at the shits
[1785.04s -> 1787.92s]  Like he was just straight up smurfing on the enemy top laner
[1789.16s -> 1793.20s]  We all the entire team just like decided to collectively run it down
[1795.08s -> 1797.08s]  Like we all just got shit on
[1802.00s -> 1805.04s]  This was a really weird game because I feel like
[1808.16s -> 1813.36s]  That game was like the first game I felt everybody in the game was like actually high GM challenger
[1813.36s -> 1817.32s]  But they weren't right at that there's a very weird system going on
[1819.16s -> 1821.16s]  I
[1822.68s -> 1824.68s]  Just do a Cassiopeia game
[1829.92s -> 1831.92s]  Like I'll show you guys what I mean in a second
[1837.16s -> 1839.16s]  I'm assuming I should go this right
[1844.48s -> 1849.00s]  This is probably good or this that's probably good too
[1849.16s -> 1851.16s]  Oh
[1854.92s -> 1857.48s]  Well, okay, so yeah, we'll get this stuff
[1858.48s -> 1865.40s]  Like neon Tonsu is like he's been challenger for a long time, right? I don't even know who the fuck this guy was
[1867.28s -> 1870.48s]  Some random Senna player who's like not playing Senna now
[1873.36s -> 1876.12s]  And then this guy was like trying to jungle and just like running it down
[1876.48s -> 1881.08s]  It was I don't even know it was the weirdest game that I've played in a while
[1882.80s -> 1885.56s]  Cuz like my ad carry wasn't bad
[1886.36s -> 1890.60s]  Like this guy's clearly like on a smurf, but I don't know how good he was cuz he wasn't bad at the game
[1892.12s -> 1894.12s]  The enemy ad carry wasn't bad
[1895.08s -> 1897.08s]  This guy's also on a smurf
[1897.24s -> 1900.56s]  It was the weirdest lobby. It was like a bunch of smurf accounts
[1901.04s -> 1904.40s]  All playing with each other, but it was like a non-smurf queue
[1906.96s -> 1909.76s]  This guy was like the only non-smurf
[1912.04s -> 1914.04s]  It was interesting
[1922.56s -> 1930.76s]  Ooh, do I take ghost here or do I just I thought ghosts could be really OP versus their team with Cassiopeia, but maybe I should just take
[1937.04s -> 1941.28s]  I'm gonna try it. Oh somebody dodged
[1943.20s -> 1946.68s]  Cuz yeah, I don't know I never know I never know what you take ghost ignite whatever
[1948.48s -> 1954.64s]  Cuz I feel like ghost with Cassio's feels like the same thing's ad carry right same idea where it feels really OP
[1954.64s -> 1968.48s]  Dude, there's so much drama going on in the league community yet again by the way, it's
[1973.80s -> 1975.80s]  It's insane
[1985.64s -> 1998.60s]  Yeah, I don't know man, I I just I'm
[2004.96s -> 2012.16s]  Like I like looking at drama cuz like drama is juicy like I like looking at drama, but it's also like
[2015.08s -> 2017.08s]  How are people so stupid
[2033.52s -> 2039.68s]  Yeah, I'm getting like I I don't know man my view on all of this shit is like I
[2040.68s -> 2041.88s]  I
[2041.88s -> 2049.36s]  Guess I'm just not hardwired that way. I can't mentally wrap my head around being like excited the flirt with underage girls
[2049.92s -> 2051.92s]  Or like when like I
[2054.96s -> 2057.44s]  Just I never like had the want
[2060.88s -> 2063.00s]  Like it happens so much
[2063.88s -> 2069.48s]  Between like league streamers and non like just it's not even a league thing. It's just that we're in the league community, right?
[2069.48s -> 2070.72s]  So you see it more
[2070.72s -> 2072.24s]  dude like
[2072.24s -> 2074.74s]  well, the drama is like a
[2075.52s -> 2081.88s]  Decent-sized league streamer who is like getting bigger or whatever like the ad carry streamer cookie roll or whatever he was like
[2082.44s -> 2084.44s]  Somebody made a 90 page
[2086.04s -> 2088.04s]  90 pages of
[2088.44s -> 2090.44s]  Google Doc
[2091.44s -> 2094.36s]  To basically like expose this guy for like
[2095.12s -> 2097.48s]  Talking a bunch like sexually to underage girls
[2098.12s -> 2103.56s]  Not paying his fucking like mods who do work for him and like other stuff, and I'm like, dude
[2111.60s -> 2113.60s]  Yeah, how man
[2113.60s -> 2125.38s]  Like just be a normal human it's not that bad like I take it for me being a normal dude. It's not that bad
[2143.60s -> 2145.60s]  You
[2173.60s -> 2175.60s]  You
[2200.24s -> 2202.24s]  Sorry, I was distracted no
[2202.80s -> 2208.16s]  Yeah, I don't know man. I I swear to God people are just stupid as fuck people were idiots
[2210.12s -> 2215.60s]  There's got to be some psychological underline issue with people's brains not working, but it is what it is
[2218.76s -> 2221.28s]  Huh, I've had this market account for a while
[2228.80s -> 2230.96s]  Dude, what is that tarik skin
[2233.12s -> 2233.92s]  I
[2233.92s -> 2242.56s]  See this we this tarik skin man. He's fabulous. Good day. My man's just straight up fabulous
[2256.32s -> 2258.32s]  People are desperate I
[2258.56s -> 2263.92s]  Just can't like I don't think like I've been in the situation whereas I was like a really really big streamer
[2264.56s -> 2269.68s]  Like much bigger than he is and I got like I this is what I'm saying is like I understand
[2272.00s -> 2276.48s]  Like all of the crap that gets thrown at you like people will literally message you for no reason
[2277.04s -> 2281.36s]  Like you do have like fans that have like when I was at my biggest point
[2281.52s -> 2283.52s]  Like you you have fans that are younger
[2284.24s -> 2290.88s]  Girls guy it doesn't matter and like you just gotta like I just never in my mind. I guess thought like oh, I'm gonna flirt with these people like
[2291.92s -> 2296.16s]  It made me like I don't even I wouldn't even I literally didn't even see them as like sexual
[2297.44s -> 2299.44s]  In my brain
[2302.80s -> 2304.80s]  Like it blows my mind
[2307.20s -> 2311.04s]  And then the fact that like if you if you look at the google doc or whatever
[2312.00s -> 2316.24s]  The fact that like taco like I keep a taco whatever it was literally talking to him
[2316.64s -> 2320.08s]  Telling him he was doing it like what he was doing was wrong. He was like, yeah, I get it right
[2320.88s -> 2322.88s]  Then he did it again
[2333.28s -> 2336.24s]  Dude the set halting the pussy that that
[2337.60s -> 2340.40s]  I'll be on it. That may be one of the funniest lines I've ever heard
[2341.20s -> 2343.20s]  I
[2355.20s -> 2361.76s]  Like dude, I mean whatever, you know, I'm not here to kink shame whatever gets people off, you know, maybe maybe maybe that's a fetish
[2361.84s -> 2363.84s]  I don't know
[2371.04s -> 2373.04s]  I
[2395.12s -> 2397.12s]  Safe and sounds
[2398.08s -> 2405.12s]  Either way don't worry. We cannot talk about the drama real quick. We could talk about uh
[2407.12s -> 2409.12s]  How old and washed up wings of death is though
[2409.92s -> 2411.92s]  I
[2426.56s -> 2428.56s]  I'm kidding
[2432.64s -> 2434.88s]  Yo, did you see on a glider note though, did you see riot?
[2435.84s -> 2442.32s]  There was like a reddit thread or something where riot was saying that they're like gonna try and do something about smurfing in the next few months
[2444.56s -> 2446.56s]  I don't know what that means
[2447.84s -> 2449.84s]  But
[2455.44s -> 2457.44s]  Here's how it's something involving wings
[2458.00s -> 2462.64s]  Just between us. Yeah. Yeah, just between us and all the homies. Yeah. Yeah in chat. Yeah. Yeah. No nobody else say anything
[2462.72s -> 2464.72s]  It's fine. Yeah, no
[2465.84s -> 2467.84s]  No, what's up?
[2479.12s -> 2481.12s]  Watch out ain't snitches
[2495.76s -> 2497.76s]  I
[2499.60s -> 2505.20s]  Was a teen I made a montage of him having breakdowns in my games. Oh my god, that's amazing
[2510.40s -> 2512.40s]  Oh my god, that's amazing
[2515.04s -> 2517.20s]  I feel like I need to pay you to see this montage
[2518.40s -> 2520.40s]  Like I will give you money
[2521.60s -> 2524.08s]  Like I I need to see this is important to me
[2525.28s -> 2527.28s]  I
[2545.60s -> 2551.44s]  Oh, I have dude you should see the I I have so many rage conflations about me. It's crazy so many
[2555.28s -> 2557.84s]  I had a I had a villain arc for sure
[2565.12s -> 2567.44s]  I feel like it just comes with like being a way extremer
[2574.16s -> 2577.36s]  We players are not all mentally healthy. Let me let me tell you
[2581.20s -> 2583.20s]  Take it from me
[2585.68s -> 2587.68s]  I
[2589.36s -> 2593.52s]  Had okay, I'd like to think I'm not a villain anymore. Fuck you
[2606.80s -> 2609.84s]  I really want this plate nice
[2610.64s -> 2615.92s]  Dude, I maybe is roaming
[2624.56s -> 2630.00s]  Why is there wukong just sitting top by the way, that's actually hilarious
[2637.04s -> 2639.04s]  You know, it's interesting
[2640.08s -> 2642.08s]  I
[2643.68s -> 2649.92s]  Feel like taric actually missed that stone. I was kind of side eyeing that but I feel like he missed that stone somehow
[2670.72s -> 2674.16s]  I feel like this is the easiest game I've ever played by the way
[2674.96s -> 2676.96s]  I'm on full autopilot
[2677.12s -> 2681.76s]  Brain still waking up and I feel like they're just walking into me on repeat. I'm just killing them all
[2682.72s -> 2684.72s]  I don't even know what the fuck's going on
[2685.76s -> 2690.80s]  Like they it feels like the enemy team has not like they didn't they didn't like understand we were playing league
[2691.44s -> 2693.76s]  Right like they queued up and they were like, oh, yeah, this is league
[2695.20s -> 2697.20s]  That's what this feels like
[2697.84s -> 2701.84s]  This is what I imagine if like Mike Tyson went into a preschool, you know what I mean? Like this is what this feels like
[2722.00s -> 2724.00s]  Mike say
[2727.52s -> 2729.52s]  I
[2733.76s -> 2738.00s]  Probably could have killed those guys but I don't want to the chill
[2747.44s -> 2749.44s]  I'm assuming the wukong is gonna come bot soon
[2754.72s -> 2756.72s]  There he is
[2757.52s -> 2759.52s]  I
[2762.32s -> 2765.76s]  Damn it I quenched late I actually killed both
[2767.20s -> 2769.20s]  That was a late cleanse by me
[2769.44s -> 2771.44s]  my bed
[2772.16s -> 2774.16s]  I don't want to take the risk coming back up
[2775.12s -> 2777.12s]  She stuns me they get one shot me
[2777.52s -> 2779.52s]  I should have killed the fucking guy though
[2781.28s -> 2785.28s]  The wukong I just backed up too far and then I quenched the stun for no like really late
[2787.20s -> 2789.20s]  I
[2795.20s -> 2797.20s]  I drew it was a man. It's all boys
[2797.92s -> 2802.16s]  Good evening. Good evening. Good morning. I don't know where the fuck you guys live. So good day
[2802.16s -> 2804.16s]  I
[2815.36s -> 2817.36s]  Fuck am I watching?
[2826.08s -> 2828.08s]  Wait that wukong lived
[2833.12s -> 2835.12s]  Whoa bro
[2836.40s -> 2838.40s]  Oh, I'm dead
[2839.44s -> 2841.44s]  Dude that wall was bs
[2843.44s -> 2847.36s]  There was like a little hole and then I flashed late because I was like, oh, I could walk out the hole
[2848.00s -> 2850.00s]  But I couldn't walk out the tiny little hole
[2852.08s -> 2857.04s]  Motherfuckers I shouldn't have even been there but like I'm stupid
[2858.00s -> 2860.00s]  I
[2861.92s -> 2866.48s]  Just push bot I was like, dude, that's such a bad fight, but I walked over to those like I'm really fat
[2867.60s -> 2870.88s]  Honestly, I probably could have killed him if I didn't say if I like flashed the
[2872.24s -> 2874.24s]  stun
[2875.68s -> 2877.68s]  Annie stuns the only
[2878.24s -> 2883.76s]  Like most over like I swear if they reduced Annie stun by like 0.5 seconds. She would never get played
[2884.72s -> 2886.72s]  Like actually
[2886.80s -> 2890.00s]  The only reason to play Annie is her stun is just so OP
[2890.88s -> 2896.80s]  Because it's like a it's like the reason they changed tarak so long ago where like when you have a point click cc
[2900.56s -> 2902.56s]  It's typically really broken
[2911.20s -> 2913.20s]  Okay, I'm just dead
[2913.84s -> 2916.00s]  Does tarak not have ult leveled up at six
[2921.68s -> 2923.68s]  He didn't level his ulti
[2937.36s -> 2939.36s]  Wow
[2940.80s -> 2943.04s]  Maybe it's maybe tarak old sucks
[2944.00s -> 2946.96s]  Maybe it's underpowered, you know
[2948.88s -> 2950.88s]  No, yeah, he must have misclicked
[2959.28s -> 2962.56s]  Honestly, I'm just briefing I'm like playing to aggro for like
[2963.84s -> 2967.36s]  Like I I threw my lead because I was like, oh shit. I'm gonna walk over and help the homies
[2967.92s -> 2971.36s]  You never walk over and help the homies when the homies are getting shit on because uh
[2972.32s -> 2977.04s]  If you have like 900 gold or a thousand gold lead like like I did or whatever you don't want to do that because
[2978.00s -> 2980.24s]  You'll give mf a ton of kills
[2983.60s -> 2985.60s]  We're in a good spot now though
[2994.32s -> 2998.32s]  But I am still a little wait tarak. Oh, I double this old winners
[2998.48s -> 3002.96s]  This tarak does not know how to play tarak by the way
[3005.36s -> 3007.36s]  He's throwing out his stuns so awkwardly
[3011.12s -> 3013.92s]  That's okay though. I mean, I apparently don't know how to play driving so
[3018.40s -> 3020.40s]  Can't really blame the guy
[3025.04s -> 3027.36s]  I mean you guys are doing dragon with no smite
[3029.04s -> 3031.04s]  I
[3031.60s -> 3033.60s]  Seems like doing dragon with no smite
[3044.80s -> 3049.60s]  I mean we could fight these fights, but it's like painful
[3052.48s -> 3054.48s]  We could easily fight these fights
[3055.44s -> 3057.60s]  I think a lot of it is just like
[3058.48s -> 3063.04s]  Tarak isn't confident enough to walk up and stun right like that's that's what I'm seeing the issue is
[3063.68s -> 3068.16s]  He's doing the thing where like he's not uh, he doesn't have the confidence to actually walk up since he's a melee champ
[3071.92s -> 3074.16s]  So he's walking up and like taking half his health
[3075.04s -> 3077.04s]  Uh, and it's making him nervous
[3077.68s -> 3079.68s]  It happens a lot with players
[3080.00s -> 3082.96s]  Who aren't very melee champ centric
[3083.92s -> 3086.96s]  Because melee supports are actually pretty risky or they're pretty scary rather
[3097.60s -> 3099.60s]  Oh, he's totally dead. I don't remember not
[3100.32s -> 3103.92s]  But yeah, melee supports are scary to play uh because you have to know
[3105.44s -> 3108.16s]  When you can get a kill by going in because you're gonna take damage, right?
[3108.88s -> 3112.48s]  That's just like the nature of melee supports
[3116.80s -> 3124.48s]  Nice we're coming back in a bit not bad. We threw a little bit early, but yeah, we're starting to get it back. We're chillin
[3127.28s -> 3128.96s]  Tarak's a never-good
[3128.96s -> 3135.60s]  I I'm always confused by Tarak because he feels like such a good champion like the champion itself feels broken as shit
[3136.56s -> 3140.32s]  Like whatever I whenever I see Tarak. I think to myself like
[3142.32s -> 3146.24s]  He's either unkillably like super OP or
[3147.44s -> 3149.44s]  they're like
[3149.52s -> 3151.52s]  0 and 10
[3151.52s -> 3155.12s]  There's no in between right like they either know how to play tarak or they don't is what it feels like
[3166.00s -> 3168.00s]  Oh
[3169.60s -> 3172.64s]  You I mean, yeah, you are wrong tarak actually requires mechanics
[3174.48s -> 3176.48s]  That's actually true
[3176.72s -> 3179.36s]  Where's like most supports like not always doesn't have mechanics, you know
[3180.00s -> 3184.48s]  And like what's crank doesn't have mechanics. They just hit their button and if it if it works they
[3185.12s -> 3187.12s]  They get a kill
[3188.24s -> 3191.76s]  Where's like tarak after you stun there is like stuff you have to do that does make sense
[3195.60s -> 3197.60s]  I
[3207.12s -> 3209.12s]  Or block
[3210.24s -> 3212.80s]  Do you think um, oh i'm gonna die
[3214.96s -> 3216.96s]  Oh, thank god
[3219.04s -> 3222.48s]  Do you think tarak's one of the harder supports I think he's I think he's pretty hard
[3223.04s -> 3229.12s]  Like I don't think he's well, I mean he's harder than the other supports like I think like
[3229.68s -> 3231.68s]  I don't think there's a single support that's hard
[3232.88s -> 3234.88s]  I know I'm I'm toxic for that but
[3236.08s -> 3238.08s]  I stand by it
[3252.64s -> 3254.64s]  I
[3256.24s -> 3258.24s]  Mean I'm just gonna die. I'm not gonna try and flash
[3258.96s -> 3261.12s]  I don't think I should have just flashed over
[3261.68s -> 3265.20s]  But I kind of got baited by the tarak ult. I wanted to see like if I could fight
[3265.68s -> 3267.68s]  But there's too much to see
[3268.16s -> 3270.16s]  I was like, oh he's ulting me. Let's go
[3272.00s -> 3276.00s]  I can tell this is a really low elo game because there's so much random deaths like
[3276.48s -> 3278.80s]  I'm I'm falling victim to like I'm autopiloting
[3279.28s -> 3282.96s]  And like I'm not thinking and I'm just talking to you guys and I'm just dying for free
[3283.52s -> 3287.12s]  But it's like there's so many people just dying for free. It's hilarious
[3287.76s -> 3289.76s]  Thresh Thresh isn't actually that far
[3290.40s -> 3292.40s]  so
[3292.64s -> 3297.68s]  Like a lot of people think like thresh mechanically is very difficult because he is harder than the other supports
[3298.08s -> 3300.48s]  But he's not actually that hard. He's like
[3301.28s -> 3304.32s]  Once you learn the thresh combos. He's pretty much
[3304.88s -> 3308.24s]  A very upfront champion
[3312.96s -> 3314.96s]  Yeah, like
[3317.68s -> 3323.20s]  Like lantern for example is one of the most broken things to ever be put in league and everybody fucks it up
[3324.08s -> 3328.24s]  Like people will will just mess up lantern because they'll throw it for souls or they'll mess up
[3328.24s -> 3330.72s]  Like you can literally just hold lantern perma
[3331.68s -> 3333.68s]  And your ad carry can walk up
[3334.80s -> 3339.12s]  Auto the turret and and and you literally like they literally can't play the game after that
[3345.44s -> 3348.56s]  Like the enemy team I mean because like there's nothing they can do to stop it
[3350.72s -> 3352.72s]  We can totally fight this by the way
[3353.60s -> 3357.20s]  So like I've done that before we're like my thresh. I know I have a good throw. Hold on
[3357.20s -> 3359.20s]  Let me let me win this team fight really quick
[3360.56s -> 3362.56s]  Give me a sec
[3364.32s -> 3366.32s]  The enemy has been seen
[3384.00s -> 3390.08s]  All right, cool. Sorry. I had to I had to win that team power quick. Okay. So as I was saying, uh, there's a lot more to thresh than
[3391.44s -> 3393.44s]  People think right
[3393.52s -> 3397.20s]  It's essentially people over complicate like what he needs to do
[3397.76s -> 3400.72s]  So it's like thresh is a very basic like when you see thresh in pro play
[3401.12s -> 3404.56s]  You you don't ever see like what you do, but it's very rare that you see like the sick
[3405.36s -> 3410.40s]  perma hooking like oh my god, like it's mainly like they pick him for like lantern
[3411.60s -> 3412.88s]  straight up
[3412.88s -> 3416.48s]  Like when they when they pick thresh and high elo, he's not picked to be the god tier like
[3416.96s -> 3422.08s]  Always landing perma cc hooks like flay god like he's picked to like shut down engage
[3422.72s -> 3424.72s]  and uh remove
[3425.76s -> 3428.08s]  Kill threat to your carries that's always picked for
[3430.88s -> 3432.88s]  That's he's literally just an ew bot
[3435.12s -> 3440.00s]  Armor stacking I mean, yeah, the the armor thing on thresh is nice, but it's I wouldn't say it's like op on his kit
[3442.64s -> 3446.08s]  It just makes him like not died to 80 carries in two seconds
[3446.48s -> 3448.48s]  What what has happened
[3450.64s -> 3458.48s]  But I instantly know I'm playing with a good thresh player when I can walk up to the turret
[3462.00s -> 3464.00s]  When I can walk up to the turret and the threat
[3476.80s -> 3481.28s]  Talk at the same time when I can walk up to the turret my thresh player won't walk up and auto the turret with me
[3481.60s -> 3483.60s]  That's like the sign of a good thresh player
[3484.24s -> 3489.12s]  When we don't know where the enemy is and instead of walking up and trying to hit the turret to like help you kill the turret
[3489.44s -> 3494.08s]  They'll stand in the back and literally just sit there and wait and hold lantern until uh
[3497.04s -> 3501.28s]  They just hold their lantern until like you can until you get ganked essentially
[3502.24s -> 3504.24s]  Your team has destroyed
[3504.72s -> 3508.88s]  And that's why like I said, I I just personally don't think thresh is mechanics. There's hard as people think
[3509.68s -> 3513.52s]  I do think he's he's very knowledge based like I think thresh has high knowledge caps
[3514.24s -> 3516.88s]  Where like if you're playing I don't know like lulu
[3517.52s -> 3521.84s]  Your skill is basically like do I w your your decision-making on lulu is literally
[3522.48s -> 3529.92s]  Do I w to speed or do I w to cc right like that's your that's your like decision making so it's like obviously much higher than that
[3529.92s -> 3531.92s]  but it's uh
[3534.56s -> 3536.32s]  You son of a bitch
[3536.32s -> 3538.32s]  But it's still not like that bad
[3539.20s -> 3541.44s]  I think thresh just intimidates people because
[3542.24s -> 3544.24s]  He can do so much
[3544.64s -> 3549.12s]  And so I think people just get intimidated but because they they think it looks overwhelming to learn the champ
[3553.92s -> 3558.24s]  I feel like that actually intimidates a lot of people in terms of like people not wanting to
[3559.04s -> 3561.04s]  Learn new champions and shits
[3561.84s -> 3563.84s]  I feel like a lot of it is just
[3564.64s -> 3566.08s]  um
[3566.08s -> 3568.88s]  People are nervous about learning champions that look overwhelming
[3569.60s -> 3571.60s]  right
[3572.48s -> 3577.92s]  Like a felios for example, I was talking about this yesterday a felios is not a hard mechanical champion like
[3578.72s -> 3580.72s]  he's difficult in terms of
[3581.60s -> 3584.56s]  The knowledge required like he's knowledge gated very hard
[3585.44s -> 3591.68s]  Right so like you have to play him a decent amount or like research him to understand what guns do what
[3592.16s -> 3597.04s]  How to interact with the guns stuff like that right but the actual mechanics of using the guns
[3597.76s -> 3599.76s]  It's actually not hard
[3600.40s -> 3602.40s]  Guys, what are we doing?
[3602.40s -> 3604.40s]  I
[3614.00s -> 3616.00s]  Guess we're just winning the fight
[3618.88s -> 3620.88s]  Pike
[3621.60s -> 3623.60s]  Like like I think pikes harder than thresh
[3626.40s -> 3629.28s]  Maybe that's a hot take but I think pike is harder than thresh
[3629.44s -> 3634.16s]  Because pike requires like really specific
[3637.12s -> 3642.80s]  Pike is a lot harder to play than he looks when you see people play him
[3644.80s -> 3648.56s]  Because there's like timers of when you can go in off of certain things
[3649.12s -> 3652.56s]  Like hitting his ulti consistently in teamfights is a little harder than people think
[3653.44s -> 3658.64s]  And knowing how to position in the lane like pike is capable of a lot more than people think
[3659.44s -> 3663.92s]  So I think pikes I think the reason the main reason I think pikes a little harder is because he's melee
[3668.88s -> 3675.52s]  Like melee champions are always going to be like mechanically more difficult than ranged if the melee champion is like
[3678.16s -> 3683.28s]  You have to engage to go in and do stuff because there's always the counter play factor
[3690.00s -> 3696.40s]  Support role. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's like I'm not saying overall like overall ranged champions require a lot more mechanics than melee
[3696.80s -> 3700.08s]  Just because you're ranged you can die in a global and you have to space and stuff
[3700.72s -> 3704.24s]  But I think that like in just the support you support support specific
[3704.72s -> 3709.04s]  I think melee is a lot harder to play. That's why you see a lot of like support players
[3710.40s -> 3714.48s]  We give like the best support players in the world are really good at like the engage melee supports
[3714.72s -> 3717.68s]  Not the like enchanters and that's why you see like why we praise
[3718.40s -> 3720.40s]  The best support players
[3721.60s -> 3728.48s]  Because like when you see somebody go in like perfectly on rakan or go in like find a way in without getting knocked up on like
[3730.64s -> 3736.48s]  I don't know something like when they find the angle on thrash and it's really nice
[3747.84s -> 3754.40s]  Rel I think rel sucks. I think that champ is so bad because she just like
[3758.96s -> 3760.96s]  She doesn't do anything
[3761.60s -> 3764.96s]  Like rel's rel's initial thing was like she she was supposed to go in
[3766.08s -> 3770.56s]  Be really tanky and then be like a stun bot for like team fights. She was a team fight monster
[3771.04s -> 3773.04s]  but the problem with rel is like
[3773.76s -> 3779.84s]  She has one chance essentially in lane phase like if anybody has fingers on their hands and they can move left and right
[3780.48s -> 3782.48s]  rel's really easy to dodge
[3782.72s -> 3786.40s]  Like it's actually like it's incredibly easy to beat a rel in lane to not die to her
[3787.20s -> 3793.12s]  Like you just have to move left and right, right? It's very simple. So it's like it's much more difficult to dodge like
[3796.72s -> 3800.08s]  Other engage champs if that makes sense like not a less you can still move left and right
[3800.16s -> 3802.16s]  But it's like he can walk at you while it's happening
[3802.72s -> 3804.72s]  Where it's like if rel walks at you
[3804.72s -> 3809.68s]  I'm still like just waiting for the animation and then I can simply move to the left
[3810.48s -> 3812.08s]  because like her
[3812.08s -> 3818.40s]  Animation is so slow on using her ability that I can like dash I can flash I can there's so much counter play
[3818.96s -> 3823.36s]  And it's like unless she flashes on you, but it's even then you can tell she's gonna flash on you. So it's like
[3824.80s -> 3827.92s]  I also feel like mid game rel has this issue where
[3828.64s -> 3835.04s]  She has her one trick ulti engage fight in teamfights, but after she does that she does literally nothing
[3837.20s -> 3839.20s]  Right she's like a one and done
[3841.12s -> 3843.68s]  That's why like she feels like she doesn't have other expression
[3850.88s -> 3852.80s]  She's countered so hard by the meta too
[3853.76s -> 3855.76s]  Milio counters rel engage
[3856.80s -> 3858.80s]  Thresh counters rel engage
[3859.28s -> 3863.76s]  Right like either either of those champions shits on rel engage and you can't do anything
[3875.76s -> 3877.76s]  Like I don't know if you've ever tried to play rel
[3878.32s -> 3885.20s]  Gone in and been like Thresh flayed, but it's the worst feeling. It's a bad feeling
[3887.76s -> 3890.88s]  It's like when people play leona, it's the same reason leona is shit right now
[3891.76s -> 3892.80s]  like
[3892.80s -> 3894.80s]  They both have the same idea of why they're bad, right
[3896.16s -> 3899.12s]  They like have they're both good at doing what they're supposed to do
[3899.68s -> 3903.68s]  Like you know stun and create pressure and point clicking shit, but the problem is is like
[3904.56s -> 3910.56s]  You can easily counter pick them so incredibly hard that they just become worthless the whole game
[3914.72s -> 3916.72s]  Have you ever gotten senna second intermission? Oh all the time
[3917.60s -> 3921.84s]  With senna being like with thresh being meta and senna being like a champion i'm playing a lot
[3921.92s -> 3923.92s]  I get that all the time
[3925.84s -> 3927.84s]  You don't even notice it though i'm gonna be real
[3929.04s -> 3931.12s]  When you kill the thresh or whatever and you get his souls
[3931.12s -> 3934.16s]  You don't even fucking notice it because like it's like 40 armor
[3938.16s -> 3940.80s]  And it's like your level 17 or some shit at that point
[3941.92s -> 3947.36s]  Like at the point you're getting it you're such a high level that like the 40 random armor like it's nice
[3947.44s -> 3949.44s]  But I never really notice it
[3956.08s -> 3958.08s]  Trying to get your teammates ahead isn't that good
[3958.48s -> 3961.84s]  You know what i've actually been doing uh as support on my main account
[3962.56s -> 3964.56s]  I've actually been
[3965.60s -> 3968.48s]  Roaming non-stop and it's super op
[3974.96s -> 3976.96s]  Because the key to roaming is
[3977.68s -> 3979.68s]  All you have to do to roam well
[3980.16s -> 3982.16s]  Is literally be there
[3982.24s -> 3986.80s]  One or two times in the first five minutes of the game to completely fuck over
[3987.36s -> 3994.48s]  The enemy one time on an engage or something and they get so far behind from it that you can literally just walk back bot
[3998.40s -> 4003.28s]  Like I do on senna like I'll push bot lane this this is my strategy on senna i'm gonna give it to you guys okay
[4003.84s -> 4009.12s]  So I don't I don't know if this works in low elo, but in like masters like high masters this works at least
[4010.80s -> 4013.92s]  This is all I do on senna every single player I play against on senna
[4014.64s -> 4019.44s]  Every single one except for like pike players even nautilus blitz they they all concede lane level one
[4020.00s -> 4023.12s]  Every single one of them right they just they just let me push level one
[4023.84s -> 4025.84s]  And so I'll push the waves in level one
[4026.40s -> 4032.56s]  And I'll either crash wave two or wave three depending on how far they're giving me like push power right
[4033.20s -> 4037.68s]  So I will always crash wave two or wave three bot and I will immediately
[4039.12s -> 4041.12s]  roam mid
[4041.12s -> 4043.04s]  every time
[4043.04s -> 4044.64s]  and
[4044.64s -> 4046.64s]  Even if I don't get a kill
[4047.04s -> 4052.08s]  Usually it fucks over the enemy mid laner so badly because on that exact timer
[4053.04s -> 4056.64s]  There's usually a gank happening on mid
[4060.08s -> 4065.60s]  So a lot of the time people think that you're roaming to get a kill for the laner you're not
[4066.16s -> 4068.16s]  You're roaming to counter
[4068.48s -> 4070.80s]  Pressure from the other players in the game
[4073.44s -> 4078.48s]  How many times have you guys been like oh we can win this 2v2 you see the enemy jungler your jungler comes
[4078.48s -> 4082.56s]  You're like oh, we're gonna bait this and then all of a sudden the support shows up and you're like god damn it
[4083.20s -> 4085.20s]  And then you die and you're like what the fuck
[4085.76s -> 4090.64s]  That right there is how easy it is to play support because all you have to do is show up
[4091.36s -> 4092.48s]  once
[4092.48s -> 4093.60s]  twice
[4093.60s -> 4096.32s]  And now that entire lane is fucked for the enemy team
[4097.28s -> 4099.28s]  You
[4102.16s -> 4103.84s]  Roaming is so easy
[4103.84s -> 4110.48s]  The only thing people fuck up roaming really bad when they roam on timers where their adc can't safely farm
[4111.20s -> 4115.28s]  So what ends up happening is on that timer right where like I told you wave two three, right?
[4116.24s -> 4122.48s]  What happens is you push that wave and you roam mid. Let's say nothing happens. Okay. I can just walk back bot
[4123.20s -> 4124.96s]  It's you lose nothing
[4124.96s -> 4129.60s]  And if usually at that point you're not you have like three inner gold so there's no point in backing right now
[4129.68s -> 4132.24s]  Let's say like I noticed that my jungler is like
[4133.12s -> 4136.08s]  Invading top side. I just walk over to top and help him
[4137.44s -> 4139.44s]  Because you have like three to four
[4140.24s -> 4146.48s]  You have like three to four waves before the enemy bot lane the enemy bot lane has to play it almost perfectly
[4147.04s -> 4154.00s]  To be able to abuse your roam on certain timers
[4155.76s -> 4157.92s]  They essentially have to play it perfect to abuse the roam
[4158.64s -> 4160.40s]  What I mean by that is like
[4160.40s -> 4163.76s]  The way the best way to abuse support roaming is you either a
[4165.12s -> 4167.68s]  If you have the ability to dive you can pretty much a
[4169.92s -> 4174.72s]  Immediately dive like push the next wave and then immediately dive if you like have that ability say playing
[4174.72s -> 4179.92s]  We own a draven or something but even then it's a little risky because then the ad carry can just walk back
[4180.08s -> 4184.56s]  And they only lose one wave and you gave up, you know a stack chance. So it's not that bad
[4185.12s -> 4186.32s]  two
[4186.32s -> 4190.80s]  You can um stack the wave now stacking the wave is the best way to counter it
[4191.60s -> 4195.44s]  Because let's say i'm roaming for an extended period you stack like a three wave
[4195.84s -> 4200.24s]  And then all of a sudden you're crashing it and my and then you want to like you're up a level because you've been gaining xp
[4200.24s -> 4202.24s]  And the ad carry has to back off
[4202.24s -> 4209.04s]  But the way to counter that is you simply just walk back on the timer of the stacked wave crashing as an ad carry or as a support
[4209.60s -> 4211.60s]  It's so incredibly easy to do
[4211.60s -> 4213.60s]  It's actually brainlessly easy to do
[4214.40s -> 4216.40s]  like all it's literally
[4217.04s -> 4222.64s]  You can roam all you want bot lane as long as you are in bot lane for the stacked wave crashes
[4222.80s -> 4226.08s]  Or you are in bot lane when your jungler is bot side of the map
[4230.64s -> 4232.64s]  It's easy as fuck
[4233.92s -> 4238.32s]  But support players drooling themselves so they like to essentially
[4240.08s -> 4246.16s]  Support players like to like afk in the lane phase. They like to literally sit there and just do nothing
[4248.00s -> 4252.00s]  That's like the average support I see is they will stand and do nothing
[4254.72s -> 4256.80s]  And and i've said this before but i'll say it again
[4256.88s -> 4262.32s]  Being a good support is not being a better player than the enemy team being a good support is queuing up to play league of legends
[4263.92s -> 4269.28s]  That's that's all it takes all it takes to be a good support is queuing up with the intent to push buttons in the game
[4270.48s -> 4272.48s]  And not just afk
[4286.80s -> 4288.80s]  You
[4303.12s -> 4305.12s]  Hmm
[4316.80s -> 4319.76s]  You
[4346.80s -> 4349.76s]  You
[4376.80s -> 4378.80s]  You
[4406.80s -> 4409.76s]  You
[4436.80s -> 4439.76s]  You
[4466.80s -> 4468.80s]  You
[4497.44s -> 4506.32s]  All right, I'm back. What's up? I don't remember what we're talking about. Oh supports. Yeah, they're all stupid
[4511.28s -> 4515.28s]  Don't afk on support you'll gain lp so it's that it's actually that easy
[4527.76s -> 4530.80s]  Honestly, I don't think supports are stupid. I think it's more of a
[4531.92s -> 4535.04s]  How do I phrase this it's in my opinion it's more of like a
[4537.76s -> 4539.76s]  They're like they've never they don't have to learn
[4545.20s -> 4550.80s]  Support players like don't have to learn uh important things because they can get away with not doing it
[4551.12s -> 4553.12s]  So they get they develop bad habits. That's all it is
[4557.68s -> 4559.68s]  You
[4562.56s -> 4564.96s]  Do have a spot if I play with yeah
[4569.68s -> 4571.68s]  Best role to climb
[4571.84s -> 4574.40s]  I think every role is good to climb as long as you're good
[4575.20s -> 4577.20s]  Classic jara. Oh, I don't see
[4577.52s -> 4581.36s]  Whatever you linked like I don't know about links in the chat because I had to turn them off a long time ago
[4582.88s -> 4584.88s]  So I can't see it
[4586.80s -> 4588.80s]  I
[4590.48s -> 4592.48s]  Would say the climbing is just about like whatever
[4592.96s -> 4595.36s]  Because every role you can climb on right like every single role
[4595.92s -> 4599.36s]  So climbing a lot of the time is just about what you think
[4604.72s -> 4608.16s]  Is most fun for you and you can get the best that I would say
[4609.20s -> 4611.04s]  objectively
[4611.04s -> 4614.56s]  The best roles to climb on are jungle and support for just like
[4614.80s -> 4616.80s]  higher elo
[4617.20s -> 4619.76s]  Well jungle and lower elo support and higher elo
[4621.28s -> 4623.28s]  I wouldn't climb on support in like gold
[4624.40s -> 4628.00s]  Because you're not gonna have a good time trying to like help bad players play the game
[4629.68s -> 4631.52s]  Bad that's mean
[4631.52s -> 4636.08s]  People who don't like you can get it like a gold ezreal 30 kills by being the better support
[4636.48s -> 4638.08s]  But you won't always win
[4638.08s -> 4644.08s]  Whereas like if you really want to control solo queue and your teammates aren't like good enough to carry at that level
[4644.56s -> 4650.96s]  By themselves, right like you get frustrated just pick something that has more agency in the game
[4659.12s -> 4661.44s]  You lost 18 of 24 is jungle you want to turn any role?
[4662.32s -> 4665.60s]  I mean you could play it. It's if you think it's any curious
[4666.56s -> 4668.72s]  Interesting. I wouldn't say it's like fun
[4670.16s -> 4672.16s]  But it's not it's not bad
[4675.12s -> 4677.12s]  You're in gold
[4677.60s -> 4679.60s]  I mean you could try it
[4680.16s -> 4682.56s]  My view on it is if people were wondering if they want to play a role or not
[4683.12s -> 4686.00s]  My view is just try it see if you like it because if you don't like the role
[4686.00s -> 4689.12s]  You're not going to be able to put in enough games to get good at the role, right? So like
[4690.16s -> 4692.16s]  Just give it a try see if you enjoy it or not
[4692.16s -> 4695.52s]  And if like it's not fun then if it's not your play style, it's not fun
[4696.08s -> 4698.80s]  Because 80s are very unique play style from all the other roles
[4700.32s -> 4702.32s]  Like the reason
[4702.56s -> 4704.56s]  Like there the reason
[4704.80s -> 4709.76s]  People don't like playing ad carry and like like watching ad carry streamers and shit
[4710.48s -> 4713.84s]  Is because it ad carry is like it's boring
[4716.08s -> 4718.08s]  Any carries like
[4719.12s -> 4723.12s]  Zero like like if there was a graph of shit going on when you're playing ad carry in the game
[4723.20s -> 4728.96s]  It's like this that is like spikes to 100 and then it's back to like this, right? It's like
[4729.52s -> 4731.52s]  30 seconds
[4731.84s -> 4735.12s]  Ad carry is a lot of every game is different
[4736.16s -> 4738.16s]  Right every game when you play 80s different
[4739.44s -> 4741.44s]  uh because
[4742.00s -> 4747.28s]  You're always with a different player like a different support unless you do oq so every ad carry's game's difference
[4747.92s -> 4749.92s]  coupled with uh
[4750.32s -> 4754.08s]  You spend a lot of the game just farming like you don't get to interact with the enemy a lot
[4754.88s -> 4758.72s]  So you just kind of farm a lot of the game and even then you also like
[4760.40s -> 4764.24s]  You basically are farming for like little dopamine hits of like team fights and stuff that you get around the game
[4764.48s -> 4766.48s]  So that's kind of fun
[4768.64s -> 4771.12s]  But it's like I said, it's all you you can climb on any role
[4771.76s -> 4775.04s]  I think 80 carry requires the most mechanical skill to climb because
[4776.08s -> 4778.08s]  The difference between uh
[4778.40s -> 4781.12s]  Climbing is like a jungler is about being in the right spot at the right time, right?
[4781.20s -> 4783.84s]  Like you need to path this way get objectives, etc
[4784.00s -> 4789.68s]  Climbing is an ad carry is more about like this person fucked up their positioning. I'm gonna kill them type shit
[4812.08s -> 4814.08s]  We're gonna start a queue
[4818.48s -> 4820.48s]  Also, I want to I want to say something
[4820.56s -> 4821.76s]  uh
[4821.76s -> 4823.76s]  If you are playing
[4824.40s -> 4828.48s]  Make sure and this is just a really good standardized bit of advice
[4829.12s -> 4833.36s]  Make sure you're always tracking what the enemy cooldowns are what their spells are stuff like that's
[4834.08s -> 4836.08s]  Okay
[4837.36s -> 4840.72s]  Because playing the game is is not just about like farming and and you know
[4840.80s -> 4843.84s]  Like your team goes into you auto and shits like right now mid's mia, right?
[4843.92s -> 4849.36s]  I can see that varus is mia, but it is a varus. So like i'm not too worried about being like level 2'd by varus
[4850.32s -> 4853.84s]  Not that much right so I can kind of play backward because I know that
[4855.20s -> 4857.92s]  It's a high chance. He's not gonna run bottom level 2 is a varus now
[4857.92s -> 4860.00s]  If that was like a fizz or some shit I immediately back up
[4860.88s -> 4867.60s]  So we notice that it's pretty obvious rakan probably got w level 2. We don't know what it is, but he has q so he doesn't have shield
[4868.16s -> 4870.16s]  Which means
[4872.16s -> 4874.16s]  Because he doesn't have shield
[4876.48s -> 4879.68s]  It's hard for the rakan to get back out if he fucks up and engage
[4880.64s -> 4885.76s]  So you need to think about these type of things right now. This is wave 4. I believe and because it's wave 4
[4886.48s -> 4891.28s]  We're gonna get level 3 on wave 4. You always get level 3 on wave 4 if you have full xp
[4894.16s -> 4896.16s]  You get level 2 on wave 2
[4897.04s -> 4901.68s]  And you get level 3 on wave 4 and uh these timers for when you get
[4902.88s -> 4905.54s]  Certain level ups bottling are very important
[4907.68s -> 4909.68s]  Now i'm gonna hover over here
[4910.40s -> 4912.40s]  You see how fiddle is right here
[4913.36s -> 4915.68s]  I'm actually gonna just walk in here and see if I can like
[4917.28s -> 4919.28s]  Yeah, we see him nice
[4919.60s -> 4922.00s]  See this is exactly what I was talking about before
[4922.56s -> 4924.56s]  Do you see what my support is doing?
[4925.20s -> 4927.20s]  I I left the lane
[4928.24s -> 4929.20s]  Guys
[4929.20s -> 4933.04s]  I walked to like stand next to my jungler after we pushed the wave in
[4933.60s -> 4934.96s]  My lulu
[4934.96s -> 4939.04s]  Is hanging out by herself bot lane
[4939.20s -> 4941.20s]  Okay
[4941.44s -> 4943.44s]  They should just chill it
[4958.64s -> 4960.64s]  You don't want to do that
[4960.72s -> 4965.44s]  You don't ever want to be the guy who's like by yourself bot lane as a support
[4966.88s -> 4968.24s]  because
[4968.24s -> 4970.96s]  You don't like supports don't need gold right not really
[4971.92s -> 4973.76s]  And you don't need farm. You don't need all that shit
[4973.92s -> 4977.60s]  So if you're adc rooms and unless the wave is fucked and they're just being stupid
[4977.60s -> 4980.72s]  And you have to fix the wave or something you don't want to be by yourself in the lane
[4981.60s -> 4983.60s]  It just doesn't do anything
[4985.68s -> 4988.64s]  How about an auto tower oh, uh, I used uh
[4989.36s -> 4990.48s]  Tilda
[4990.48s -> 4994.88s]  So there's a way there's actually a setting you can have in the game where when you hit a button
[4995.68s -> 5000.48s]  It makes it so that I can't physically hit anything but a champion. It's target
[5000.80s -> 5002.80s]  It's called target champions only
[5003.44s -> 5008.00s]  And it's basically like here. I'll do it for you right now watch. You see how like I can hit the tower. You see how it's the red
[5009.04s -> 5010.16s]  sword
[5010.16s -> 5011.44s]  but
[5011.44s -> 5014.80s]  So when I hit this button, I can no longer hit the tower or the minions
[5016.16s -> 5018.16s]  But I can still hit the champions
[5019.92s -> 5024.56s]  So essentially when you're fighting at a big minion wave or you're fighting under turret
[5024.56s -> 5026.56s]  You don't want to miss click
[5027.12s -> 5029.12s]  You just hit target champions only button
[5029.84s -> 5033.84s]  And it makes it a thousand times easier because you can literally only hit the champion
[5036.40s -> 5038.40s]  It's really nice
[5047.60s -> 5051.28s]  And you can make the button anything you want obviously I just I use tilda. It's the default
[5055.12s -> 5057.12s]  I
[5057.68s -> 5061.60s]  Actually want to kill these guys, but I need to wait for the wave to push out just the hair
[5062.88s -> 5066.72s]  The jungler could be bought but it is a fiddlesticks. So it's like I don't really care about a fiddlesticks being bought
[5067.36s -> 5069.36s]  We can straight up just kill them
[5081.44s -> 5083.44s]  Okay, well apparently we can't kill them
[5084.72s -> 5086.72s]  because
[5087.44s -> 5089.92s]  Apparently my Lulu didn't want to walk up
[5091.12s -> 5099.68s]  That's so frustrating man. I did fuck up my uh my auto there, but I am a little I I am kind of curious what happens
[5100.40s -> 5102.72s]  I'd have to go watch the vod. I fucked up my kill in the zaya
[5102.80s -> 5106.32s]  I think I walked left instead or down my movement was bad
[5106.88s -> 5110.96s]  Like essentially when they fought right I walked like this. I should have walked like this
[5111.92s -> 5114.40s]  Because you want to cut off the zaya from the gank
[5114.96s -> 5118.96s]  Now I do think when lulu just blindly ran away. I think she kind of grieved
[5119.76s -> 5124.08s]  You don't need to insta run from ganks, especially when like you could see what I have right? I have dirk and sheen
[5125.60s -> 5129.60s]  Something that a lot of people do as well is they will see that like the numbers are uneven
[5130.00s -> 5131.20s]  And they'll instantly run away
[5131.20s -> 5135.04s]  They don't think about like how to win the fight or like what the the win con is of the fight
[5135.52s -> 5139.12s]  Because that's what I was saying before we got ganks, right? I was like fiddle can't gank us and he can't
[5139.20s -> 5142.08s]  Pre-6 fiddle does nothing in the gank. I had cleanse
[5142.64s -> 5145.20s]  Uh, they don't actually beat us in 3v2
[5145.76s -> 5151.20s]  So the problem was is we weren't focusing the same target. I went for the zaya and she backed really far up
[5151.92s -> 5153.92s]  Now if we had played forward a bit
[5154.64s -> 5157.44s]  Like say she played a little more forward with me that would have gone a lot better
[5157.44s -> 5162.80s]  Or if I had played a little more back with her it was basically like we don't have comms. So the you know, it got rough
[5165.20s -> 5168.48s]  Now fiddle is six now, so it's a little scary
[5169.60s -> 5173.52s]  I don't like playing versus fiddle sticks for like the reason of like 90 of the time
[5174.56s -> 5178.24s]  Players don't know how to ward around fiddle people put wards in weird spots
[5180.64s -> 5184.64s]  We should have won that fight though. I'm a little salty mainly myself
[5192.24s -> 5194.72s]  So this too lulu keeps speeding me up
[5195.84s -> 5197.60s]  um
[5197.60s -> 5200.56s]  I want to be honest with you. I don't like when lulus do that
[5203.68s -> 5206.24s]  It's like a pet peeve thing of mine when lulus use their speed
[5207.12s -> 5210.64s]  Like I'm okay with it if I need to dodge something or I need to chase somebody
[5211.04s -> 5214.56s]  But I think it's just so much less value than using it to cc early game
[5215.36s -> 5222.40s]  Early game the cc of lulu like using w is so broken to me because they they just physically can't move their character for
[5223.12s -> 5225.44s]  Like 1.5 seconds, which is crazy
[5228.32s -> 5230.32s]  I
[5232.00s -> 5234.00s]  Think fiddles bot
[5234.64s -> 5236.64s]  You can kind of tell
[5238.48s -> 5240.48s]  You see how they're playing really aggressive
[5241.20s -> 5243.20s]  They don't beat us 2v2
[5243.36s -> 5245.84s]  So I'm thinking and they just cleared this ward out
[5247.04s -> 5251.12s]  I'm thinking fiddle is either on dragon or he's bush ganking bot somewhere
[5253.20s -> 5255.20s]  So I don't really want to walk up
[5257.84s -> 5262.48s]  You see how this guy is confidently hitting the turret this is making me think fiddles trying to lane gank
[5265.44s -> 5267.44s]  Because they cannot beat us 2v2
[5269.68s -> 5271.68s]  Like I think fiddles in here
[5273.36s -> 5277.84s]  So I'm actually just gonna play safe until we see him on the map. I don't know
[5279.68s -> 5281.68s]  I'm not gonna take the chance
[5287.84s -> 5289.84s]  Because uh
[5290.88s -> 5295.60s]  You got to think about like what you see and what you don't see on the map like we can't physically see fiddle, right?
[5295.92s -> 5297.92s]  But think about this. We don't see him top
[5298.24s -> 5303.28s]  That's something you have to think about we we had a ward on rift just now for 15 15 seconds, right?
[5304.16s -> 5306.16s]  We didn't see him top
[5306.40s -> 5308.88s]  So like if he's not top, where is he?
[5311.52s -> 5313.52s]  Now I think he finally left
[5313.84s -> 5315.84s]  This looks like he went to dragon
[5316.80s -> 5318.80s]  Yeah
[5326.80s -> 5330.80s]  What are we doing by the way, I mean, I guess I'm just gonna die
[5333.28s -> 5339.76s]  Now would be the time to speed me. I mean, I don't even know what to say about that. Malzahar just didn't walk
[5340.32s -> 5342.32s]  Gragas didn't flash his e
[5343.12s -> 5345.12s]  Malzahar didn't walk
[5346.16s -> 5348.96s]  You always walk there by the way, I want to make this clear
[5349.52s -> 5352.80s]  If you're a mid laner and you're playing a late game scaling mid
[5353.36s -> 5358.32s]  You always walk to the fight no matter what though if it's at if it's going if it's doing that
[5359.52s -> 5361.52s]  Okay guys
[5362.32s -> 5364.32s]  We need to walk to fights
[5364.32s -> 5366.32s]  We need to walk to fights
[5367.04s -> 5375.28s]  We need to walk to fights and Lulu you need to follow up when I go in don't run
[5378.08s -> 5380.24s]  I'm just gonna type it because I'm actually fucking annoyed
[5382.24s -> 5383.60s]  I'm a little frustrated
[5383.60s -> 5386.88s]  I still think the game is 100% winnable, but I'm playing draven
[5387.04s -> 5389.76s]  We're playing like I'm playing fucking ezreal or some shit
[5390.80s -> 5392.80s]  And I can't walk up because essentially
[5393.20s -> 5396.24s]  We know fiddle was bought for the last two three minutes, right? He just sat down there
[5404.80s -> 5407.44s]  What is my lulu doing bro? What are you doing?
[5410.88s -> 5414.96s]  No, we we fight this go. Yeah, this guy doesn't get to do this for free
[5420.16s -> 5422.16s]  Now they have a gale force so I need to be a little care
[5423.36s -> 5425.36s]  This guy has no ulti though
[5428.00s -> 5434.24s]  Like this is what I'm losing my mind man. I dude just follow
[5438.88s -> 5442.32s]  No, what she was doing was she was trying to protect her ward
[5444.24s -> 5446.08s]  She saw the recon hitting the ward
[5446.08s -> 5448.72s]  But the Ziya walked up to get a free to just die
[5449.28s -> 5453.44s]  The problem is my Lulu was like, oh, I don't want to give up my ward and she wasn't thinking
[5458.48s -> 5461.76s]  Please uh just sit with me, okay
[5463.20s -> 5465.20s]  Caps sorry
[5465.20s -> 5468.08s]  I need you to follow me always
[5469.84s -> 5474.48s]  Even if it looks scary you gotta follow, okay
[5478.88s -> 5480.88s]  So
[5483.68s -> 5485.20s]  Also, uh
[5485.20s -> 5489.12s]  One thing is there's actually not a lot of fighting that happens in lower elo
[5489.76s -> 5490.88s]  so
[5490.88s -> 5493.52s]  A lot of these players don't know how to fight early because
[5494.24s -> 5498.40s]  One thing that I think has gotten really bad about league lately just in the past few years
[5499.12s -> 5502.24s]  Is people don't ever limit test and league ever anymore
[5502.88s -> 5504.88s]  They always just play like pussies
[5505.52s -> 5508.00s]  Every single player in league plays like a fucking pussy nowadays
[5509.04s -> 5511.52s]  And it's it's literally just like sad to see
[5518.88s -> 5524.64s]  Like right there, why aren't we wing use w on the ziya?
[5526.56s -> 5528.56s]  Not too speed
[5530.56s -> 5532.00s]  Like
[5532.00s -> 5536.56s]  I'm losing my mind because all you have to do there is w the ziya she gets cc'd we kill her in the w
[5536.96s -> 5540.80s]  I'm telling you lulu players are like hard wired
[5541.60s -> 5545.20s]  For some reason to not play correctly
[5561.84s -> 5564.56s]  I'm never gonna catch this guy he's got gale forcing tier two boots
[5567.20s -> 5574.24s]  Yeah, I mean I I have to go for it though because if I don't go for kills now the game's over
[5574.80s -> 5578.64s]  So it's either we go for it or we lose so I'm willing to like look stupid
[5582.00s -> 5585.84s]  Honestly, this game was my fault for the one 2v3 that happened early
[5585.92s -> 5589.28s]  I misplayed it and if I didn't misplay that we would have won the game off it
[5590.48s -> 5592.48s]  Now the game's pretty much over
[5593.28s -> 5598.00s]  Like it's solo queue so we can always come back, but the problem is uh, I don't think
[5598.48s -> 5602.00s]  We have good enough players to come back like look at what lulu's doing lulu
[5603.28s -> 5606.48s]  Why are you bought solo at the moment? Think?
[5609.12s -> 5611.12s]  Like what ah
[5612.40s -> 5614.40s]  What are we doing?
[5614.56s -> 5624.80s]  This is exactly what I was telling you guys doesn't make sense
[5625.44s -> 5627.92s]  Remember when I told you supports easy all you have to do
[5628.64s -> 5633.44s]  Is be a human remember when I said that 40 second or four minutes ago before the game started
[5636.08s -> 5639.92s]  All you have to do to play support is think push buttons and be active in the game
[5640.32s -> 5642.64s]  And if you can do those things you'll get challenger on support
[5645.36s -> 5651.20s]  Like it blows my mind like what look what you did what are you doing?
[5671.28s -> 5674.00s]  This is a this is a forfeit though. I'm gonna lose my minds
[5675.28s -> 5677.28s]  I'm gonna lose it
[5688.80s -> 5696.32s]  My bad guys I'm an auto filled ad I'm just bad. It's on me. I apologize
[5696.32s -> 5698.32s]  Oh
[5704.64s -> 5706.64s]  Man these players are crazy
[5710.00s -> 5712.08s]  I'm actually really surprised we're just not forfeiting now
[5715.44s -> 5720.24s]  The best way to play the game is something that like I fall victim to to where I fuck this up sometimes right
[5720.88s -> 5722.88s]  But the best way to play the game a lot of the time is
[5723.60s -> 5726.10s]  You essentially don't play to take risks
[5728.08s -> 5732.56s]  I know it sounds silly because you you got to find essentially you have to find the um
[5737.84s -> 5745.84s]  My mouths are hard just let um let this guy this 1 000 gold walk away. Hey mouse if you moved by the way
[5746.48s -> 5748.48s]  You get 1 k gold
[5753.60s -> 5760.40s]  Mid isn't hard roll I can mid in my sleep
[5765.28s -> 5767.84s]  It's not ad is easiest roll
[5775.76s -> 5782.56s]  I'm ad carry streamer I play ad but lulu is small brand
[5783.12s -> 5785.12s]  I
[5789.28s -> 5794.00s]  That was mean lulu took some some crossfire there that she didn't need to take that was my bad
[5796.48s -> 5798.48s]  That was toxic
[5813.20s -> 5818.56s]  I'll be real I think uh today is going to be a mute all kind of day
[5819.12s -> 5821.92s]  Listening to low elo players talk about the game
[5822.64s -> 5825.68s]  And then they think that they're right about the game and like how it works and all this shit
[5826.08s -> 5829.68s]  It actually like hurts me like it shouldn't I should just laugh it off
[5829.76s -> 5833.92s]  But sometimes when I see a low elo player talk about how they think the game should be played
[5834.32s -> 5836.32s]  And I just know that they're wrong
[5836.32s -> 5838.32s]  It actually like physically hurts me
[5838.88s -> 5843.52s]  It does it physically hurts
[5853.60s -> 5855.68s]  But I should follow my own rule where
[5856.40s -> 5860.00s]  If you're playing with people that aren't as good like they don't see what you see
[5860.80s -> 5864.32s]  Right there. There's like something where it's better to play safe and scale
[5864.88s -> 5869.36s]  Even on driven it's better to play safe and scale than to go for plays in lane
[5873.04s -> 5875.04s]  Mainly because
[5876.40s -> 5880.96s]  If you go for plays in lane and let's say your support is not as good as you
[5881.28s -> 5884.16s]  Or your support's not confident in their ability to 2v2, right?
[5884.56s -> 5889.12s]  Then you're just gonna lose so you're like forcing that person to be in an uncomfortable situation
[5889.68s -> 5890.80s]  So
[5890.80s -> 5893.92s]  Like it's hard for me as a player to just play safe
[5894.40s -> 5896.72s]  When I see the enemy making mistake after mistake
[5897.12s -> 5900.24s]  It's like something that I have trouble like personally working on
[5900.80s -> 5905.76s]  Right, just like a personal issue where like I'll see an enemy make a mistake positional wise
[5905.84s -> 5909.52s]  I'm like, oh shit. Let's abuse this but a lot of the time the problem that happens is
[5910.64s -> 5914.64s]  You have somebody who doesn't know that that person made a mistake or doesn't see the same mistake as me
[5915.04s -> 5918.24s]  And because there's no comms. I can't relate to them that we should fight, right?
[5918.56s -> 5924.72s]  So if I go in and they don't know that we should be fighting there, I I end up dying and it looks it feels really bad
[5927.52s -> 5929.52s]  Which is I mean
[5929.76s -> 5934.32s]  My fault. It's like a personal thing because you can't control your supports. You can only control yourself
[5935.28s -> 5937.52s]  It's just something that like I suck at doing sometimes
[5939.52s -> 5941.52s]  Right
[5942.08s -> 5944.08s]  So that's just on me
[5948.24s -> 5950.24s]  So
[5964.08s -> 5970.16s]  We could actually kill the Zyra now by the way, she's like 60 hb like we could kill her
[5978.24s -> 5980.24s]  So
[5994.08s -> 5998.48s]  What is my Gragas doing oh he got her though nice
[6005.04s -> 6007.04s]  Bro use w
[6008.48s -> 6010.48s]  To cc people
[6011.36s -> 6013.36s]  Not to speed people
[6018.48s -> 6020.48s]  That was a good example too. Oh well
[6027.20s -> 6032.24s]  I just got to get better at doing that where I play safe though. That's on me. That's just a personal thing. I got to get better at
[6038.40s -> 6040.40s]  You
[6059.84s -> 6063.36s]  Oh, man, I think we're warmed up though. What ad carry do you guys want to see next game?
[6064.80s -> 6066.80s]  That was that was a brutal ass game
[6067.68s -> 6069.68s]  I'm gonna be real that was a brutal ass game
[6071.28s -> 6074.48s]  What ad carry streamer do you guys want to see or ad carry stream what ad carry?
[6076.56s -> 6078.56s]  Champion do you guys want to see this game?
[6082.40s -> 6087.12s]  I just goofed up and tried to play too aggressive with a player that wasn't willing to play aggressive that was on me
[6088.88s -> 6090.88s]  That's my bad
[6091.68s -> 6093.68s]  I'll I'll play better
[6096.80s -> 6098.80s]  I
[6109.12s -> 6111.36s]  This guy this guy goes scion
[6118.16s -> 6121.60s]  Oh never changed twitch chat never changed
[6126.88s -> 6128.88s]  I
[6140.88s -> 6144.08s]  Well the thing is is you have I have to change my mindset so like the thing
[6144.40s -> 6146.72s]  Okay, let me explain something just like a personal thing with me
[6147.52s -> 6152.32s]  I'm very very very good mechanically at this game, right? Like it's my best trade. It's like I have very good mechanics
[6153.44s -> 6156.00s]  So and I also have like an autistic weird brain
[6156.96s -> 6158.96s]  Where I can see
[6159.84s -> 6161.84s]  I I have really good pattern recognition
[6162.24s -> 6168.48s]  So when I see that the enemy is fucking up, I know that I'm pretty much always going to be better at the 2v2
[6169.44s -> 6171.44s]  okay, so
[6172.32s -> 6175.04s]  Because I know that I'm always going to be better at the 2v2
[6176.64s -> 6178.64s]  I I always want to take the fight
[6179.84s -> 6184.32s]  When I see that they make a mistake like they miss a skill shot or they walk up too far
[6184.88s -> 6186.08s]  Stuff like that, right?
[6186.08s -> 6189.36s]  But the problem is when you're balling you have to work with a teammate
[6190.08s -> 6194.00s]  And that's part of just playing ad carry, right? And if you're in solo queue, you can't always do it
[6194.48s -> 6196.08s]  So you have to
[6196.24s -> 6198.24s]  I I have to like train myself
[6199.20s -> 6204.00s]  To just be okay with them making mistakes and us not abusing those mistakes
[6205.12s -> 6207.76s]  It's very frustrating for me personally because i'm a perfectionist
[6208.24s -> 6212.32s]  So it's very frustrating for me to like see this happening and i'm like, oh, I want to abuse this because I know we can
[6212.72s -> 6214.72s]  But we have to like I have to like
[6215.12s -> 6221.60s]  Tell myself not to and to just like not fuck up the wave state not take bad trades and shit because every time there's there's more to it
[6221.60s -> 6226.96s]  To so if like I walk up and I take a fight, right? Let's say like when rakan wed in when the fiddle ganked for example, right?
[6227.92s -> 6229.92s]  Uh, if I take that fight
[6230.40s -> 6234.24s]  I'm now banking that fight on lulu also playing correctly, right?
[6234.48s -> 6239.68s]  Like they they missed all their abilities and they fucked up, but I also messed like
[6240.64s -> 6246.96s]  You nobody can play perfectly every game like I can't teammates can't nobody can't it's league and we're all humans, right?
[6247.20s -> 6252.80s]  So you have to bank when you're doing that on like your teammate being able to know what you want to accomplish in that moment
[6253.44s -> 6258.96s]  In solo queue with no comms and it's really hard. Like it's it's a really bad mindset that I have sometimes
[6260.16s -> 6262.16s]  But it's hard to get over because like
[6263.20s -> 6264.48s]  I like
[6264.48s -> 6266.80s]  The laning phase for me is the most fun part of the game
[6267.76s -> 6268.96s]  I
[6268.96s -> 6274.48s]  Love landing fists because in my opinion the landing phase is like a little mini chess game between the enemy ball and right?
[6275.68s -> 6278.16s]  It's like a it's like a chess game with like mechanics
[6278.80s -> 6280.00s]  Where it's like
[6280.00s -> 6282.48s]  How how well can like I auto space them, right?
[6282.96s -> 6284.72s]  Can I can I space them well?
[6284.72s -> 6285.52s]  Can I space them?
[6285.52s -> 6290.24s]  Like can I by spacing? I mean can I walk into them trade and not take damage back, right?
[6290.80s -> 6294.80s]  And I'm always thinking to myself. Okay, can I do that? I can and then I'm like I want to do this, right?
[6295.28s -> 6299.04s]  And then I'll like get somebody to half and then they'll panic and they'll engage on me
[6299.52s -> 6306.32s]  And the problem is though is like I said without comms or without like people who are recognizing what you're trying to accomplish
[6307.12s -> 6311.12s]  sometimes uh supports and in junglers people get flustered
[6311.84s -> 6318.24s]  And it will go badly and it's my fault at the end of the day because I'm choosing to that playstyle of relying on my teammates
[6318.72s -> 6324.48s]  Instead of like knowing that I can probably outscale and play better late game and just like keep good cs and not die and shit
[6324.96s -> 6326.96s]  Which is what you guys should all do
[6327.92s -> 6333.60s]  And that's what I tell people to do when they ask me how to play ad I tell you like don't die scale up get items
[6334.32s -> 6338.16s]  But like because I've played the game for so long and my favorite part of the game is
[6340.16s -> 6342.96s]  Lane phase and like winning lane and playing that little chess game
[6343.28s -> 6345.28s]  I fucked myself over in a lot of games
[6345.76s -> 6347.04s]  Because I'll like
[6347.04s -> 6351.52s]  you know force fights that like my teammate would have to play well in as well to win
[6352.00s -> 6355.28s]  And uh, I'll make a mistake or they'll make a mistake and we'll just lose the game off it
[6355.76s -> 6357.76s]  And it's not a good playstyle
[6359.76s -> 6361.76s]  Right it's not a good playstyle
[6362.40s -> 6366.56s]  That's just like something that like I know other people probably also have
[6367.12s -> 6371.52s]  And I'm telling you that like if you want to climb you got to get out of that mindset and get into the mindset of like
[6372.80s -> 6374.80s]  consistency
[6376.32s -> 6380.24s]  Because you can see last game for example, uh, I just straight up like
[6380.96s -> 6382.96s]  Lost the game off of me
[6384.08s -> 6389.20s]  Trying to fight when my support didn't know how to fight or want to fight and we lost the game off it
[6391.84s -> 6393.36s]  Like I was too aggro
[6393.36s -> 6399.92s]  And even though if they did play correctly we win they didn't so we lost so it's basically like it's just not like a good, uh
[6400.96s -> 6402.96s]  It's not a good, uh
[6403.04s -> 6405.04s]  What's the word I'm looking for
[6405.12s -> 6407.12s]  strategy
[6411.20s -> 6413.20s]  Because last game was my fault
[6413.84s -> 6419.20s]  Because I'm good enough at the game that I know that I can't play like that if I want to be consistent
[6419.84s -> 6421.84s]  And I still point like it. So it's my bad
[6426.24s -> 6428.72s]  All right, what are we playing this game boys? We got Rengar
[6429.28s -> 6431.28s]  karma jinn
[6431.28s -> 6434.48s]  What if people want to see let me see if any of the 80 carries people want to see if I could play these
[6434.88s -> 6436.48s]  I
[6436.48s -> 6442.00s]  Can't play vein into this vein would be way too hard in the karma jinn. I would just get zoned off the wave
[6450.96s -> 6455.28s]  I could play a fellios this is actually a good a fellios game
[6459.52s -> 6463.04s]  You know what kind of sucks I feel kind of bad playing a fellios
[6463.76s -> 6465.76s]  When I'm on my like teaching accounts
[6466.24s -> 6468.24s]  Like this account I like teach you guys
[6468.32s -> 6470.32s]  I feel bad playing a fellio sometimes
[6471.44s -> 6476.40s]  Uh, because I know a lot of people don't want to learn a fellios or play a fellios
[6477.20s -> 6479.20s]  Because he is like really
[6480.56s -> 6482.56s]  He's very unique
[6483.20s -> 6485.68s]  Like he's he's hard to learn for a lot of people
[6486.40s -> 6488.40s]  So I feel I always feel kind of bad doing it
[6489.60s -> 6491.20s]  Right
[6491.28s -> 6495.52s]  But I'll be real. I don't know in this specific situation outside of like jinx
[6497.20s -> 6499.20s]  I didn't really know what else to pick
[6500.16s -> 6504.40s]  Like jinx is good kaisa's probably okay, but you still get zoned off the wave on kaisa
[6512.00s -> 6514.88s]  Because like if we if we look at this right, uh
[6515.20s -> 6517.20s]  I
[6517.68s -> 6519.12s]  So would have been
[6519.12s -> 6522.96s]  I guess okay, but when you're picking a champion for bot lane, right?
[6524.16s -> 6526.16s]  When you're picking a champion for bot lane
[6526.32s -> 6529.20s]  One thing that you guys should think about when picking like what you know
[6529.20s -> 6531.92s]  What champion you want to play unless you're a one trick and then play whatever you want
[6532.16s -> 6537.60s]  But if you're like somebody who wants to actually like play the meta and learn why champions are meta and when to pick what?
[6541.04s -> 6543.04s]  They picked jinn karma now
[6543.84s -> 6549.76s]  We have a lulu if we had something with a hook like a nautilus a blitz a thresh a pike
[6550.24s -> 6553.12s]  Like if we had something like that I could pick a low-range fighter
[6553.68s -> 6556.56s]  Right, like I could pick a low-range fighter if we had a hook champ
[6558.00s -> 6560.96s]  But because we don't have a hook champ and we have a uh an enchanter
[6561.44s -> 6566.96s]  I have to pick something that can safely consistently farm and not get zoned off by their bot lane
[6567.68s -> 6569.84s]  So there's not a lot of options that can do that
[6570.48s -> 6571.68s]  There's like
[6571.68s -> 6575.04s]  I didn't want to pick you could pick ezreal here. It's not the worst, but we had a lulu
[6575.04s -> 6577.20s]  So I didn't want to pick ezreal because lulu goes to waste
[6578.00s -> 6582.48s]  So it's like you could pick jinx, but I kind of didn't want to pick jinx this game because jinx bores the shit out of me right now
[6583.36s -> 6584.80s]  so uh
[6584.80s -> 6586.32s]  This would be a good jinx game though
[6586.32s -> 6591.12s]  If you guys are curious like this would be a completely fine jinx game your e stops rangar jump
[6593.20s -> 6596.64s]  Uh, you can follow up really easily with lulu like this would be a good jinx game
[6599.92s -> 6603.84s]  But a felios it's a good a felios game too. It's both. It's good a felios game good jinx game
[6604.56s -> 6606.56s]  Um, it could be a good zerry game
[6607.20s -> 6612.16s]  Zerry wouldn't be that bad here with lulu and against their comp. Uh, they're already squishy
[6612.72s -> 6615.60s]  She's really mobile can get away from like ring our ganks pretty easily
[6616.48s -> 6619.60s]  Tristana, I okay, so trist is unique because
[6621.12s -> 6623.76s]  You only pick tristana if you plan on winning lane
[6624.48s -> 6625.76s]  okay
[6625.84s -> 6630.16s]  Tristana doesn't actually scale better than jinx in any way
[6631.92s -> 6633.92s]  Like she does not have a better scaling than jinx
[6634.88s -> 6639.84s]  Trist trist vs jinx three items jinx wins every time in teamfights no matter what
[6640.64s -> 6642.88s]  Like you she just does what trist does better
[6643.76s -> 6645.12s]  um
[6645.12s -> 6649.52s]  Now the reason you pick trist is because you do want to win lane you want to like jump in you want to kill them
[6649.52s -> 6650.80s]  You want to be aggressive, right?
[6650.80s -> 6653.28s]  So that's what you're picking trist for is that I get kills in lane
[6654.08s -> 6656.64s]  The problem is is again what we were just talking about right?
[6656.64s -> 6660.96s]  Let's say I pick trist to get kills in lane now. Let's say my uh, my
[6661.60s -> 6666.00s]  Support doesn't want to be aggressive and let's say like the jane and the karma have a really good push
[6666.64s -> 6667.52s]  Okay
[6667.52s -> 6670.64s]  Something that trist is really weak at is being pushed in
[6671.20s -> 6674.56s]  Right, that's one of her weakest things because she has she struggles especially early game
[6675.12s -> 6677.12s]  She struggles quite a bit on farming under turret
[6678.16s -> 6679.04s]  so
[6679.04s -> 6680.88s]  let's say
[6680.88s -> 6686.64s]  It's just like a coin flippy pick you could pick trist if you had like a support duo for sure
[6687.36s -> 6691.36s]  Into into jinn trist is amazing into jinn. It's one of jinn's hardest actual counters
[6692.00s -> 6694.48s]  But again, it's not about countering the champion
[6694.48s -> 6698.64s]  It's about countering the lane and what the lane is going to do to you and and being able to play around that
[6699.52s -> 6701.52s]  And this lane is a shove lane
[6701.52s -> 6705.36s]  Jinn karma doesn't fight you they poke you and shove waves in that's what they do
[6705.36s -> 6706.72s]  They're a prio win
[6706.72s -> 6708.56s]  So they're just going to shove and shove and shove right
[6709.12s -> 6711.12s]  So because they're just going to shove and shove and shove
[6711.28s -> 6716.00s]  I need to play something that isn't going to have issues playing under turret or something that could shove back if I need to
[6717.36s -> 6719.92s]  Right, which is why jinx a failure us are both good
[6724.00s -> 6726.56s]  Ezreal again would just get shoved in stuff like that, right?
[6726.56s -> 6728.96s]  Oh, yeah, these are things you actually have to think about when you're playing the game
[6729.52s -> 6730.96s]  for certain
[6730.96s -> 6732.48s]  champions
[6732.48s -> 6734.88s]  In certain matchups because a lot of the time
[6735.52s -> 6741.52s]  People will pick a champion that's meta and they won't understand why they're still losing the matchup even though they're good at that champion
[6742.16s -> 6747.44s]  And it's just that you're not bad at the champ. The matchup is just unplayable. You could put faker
[6748.24s -> 6753.20s]  Double lift fucking goomy assi in certain matchups and they will just lose they will lose the matchups
[6753.52s -> 6755.84s]  And it's because no matter how good your mechanics are
[6756.72s -> 6759.20s]  If the matchup is played correctly, it doesn't it's not winnable
[6761.20s -> 6763.76s]  And that's why you see in pro play drafting is so important
[6763.76s -> 6767.52s]  It's perfect example of why in pro play drafting is 10 times more important than solo queue
[6767.84s -> 6770.80s]  And it's because when everybody plays the matchups correctly and shit, right?
[6772.88s -> 6774.88s]  When everybody's playing the matchups correctly and shits
[6776.08s -> 6779.28s]  The matchup like skill becomes a thousand times more important
[6780.64s -> 6785.20s]  Or like, you know how the matchups being play like the champions become way more important
[6785.92s -> 6787.92s]  Whoa, what the fuck?
[6788.16s -> 6790.72s]  I'm on there. Just fuck them. What the hell is going on? There we go
[6794.64s -> 6798.88s]  Uh another little tip for you guys. Oh, I fucked that but another little tip for you guys is
[6801.68s -> 6804.56s]  Melee champions or melee minions take
[6811.04s -> 6813.04s]  One turret shot two autos
[6814.40s -> 6817.84s]  Or sorry, two turrets shots one auto and casters take one auto one turret shot
[6819.60s -> 6821.92s]  When you're under turrets like luck, okay, so
[6822.88s -> 6826.72s]  Learning this will be actually a pretty good game to explain to you how to farm under the turret actually
[6827.60s -> 6830.88s]  I was thinking about like what I could teach you guys because we're just gonna get shoved in a lot this game
[6832.64s -> 6834.64s]  It's actually not that bad though
[6840.00s -> 6846.24s]  Uh, so right now we could actually space forward here. Okay, that did not hit me that was bs, but sure
[6852.72s -> 6854.72s]  I
[6856.80s -> 6859.04s]  Did the same thing I did last game man
[6860.80s -> 6862.80s]  I did the same thing you said I walked up
[6864.24s -> 6866.72s]  It wasn't it was a good fight, but again
[6867.68s -> 6872.24s]  I keep doing that or like I see the fight and I'll take the fight because I know it's a good fight
[6873.28s -> 6876.00s]  But lulu was too far back. So I ended up just inting
[6878.32s -> 6880.32s]  It's really stupid
[6881.28s -> 6883.28s]  Like that was such a dumb play by me
[6897.76s -> 6899.76s]  Because I had to blow both my sums right there because uh
[6901.28s -> 6905.44s]  The gin or I mean the gin was in a really bad spot and the karma was in a really bad spot because I was level
[6905.44s -> 6908.16s]  Three and they were level two and they were walking up to contest waves
[6909.12s -> 6913.12s]  But my uh lulu was behind me and when you're playing, you know
[6913.44s -> 6916.64s]  So will cue you have to play as a team with your teammate
[6917.52s -> 6919.52s]  Okay, so this gin is kind of griefing right now
[6925.92s -> 6929.12s]  He's griefing by like walking up when I'm blue gunning him
[6929.84s -> 6931.84s]  I
[6934.88s -> 6938.64s]  Don't know what lulu's doing. Oh, she's killing that guy nice. Yeah, they're they're griefing really hard
[6938.64s -> 6940.64s]  So the blue guns op for what you just saw
[6941.60s -> 6945.60s]  All you have to do with the blue gun if you really want to just like have a funny ass overpowered fucking
[6947.20s -> 6950.72s]  When they're farming under the turret like that, just hit the minions
[6950.72s -> 6961.04s]  Okay, we're getting ganked let's back up
[6966.80s -> 6973.36s]  So I kind of did a cardinal sin there I would say like a sin of like I overstayed a bit I think
[6975.12s -> 6977.12s]  Oh, okay, we'll fuck off dude
[6977.68s -> 6982.32s]  That was greedy. I should have backed out the turret, but I didn't think karma was actually gonna do that
[6982.32s -> 6987.68s]  But uh, I did overstay because you can see like this is the perfect example of why I overstayed so they stopped my back, right?
[6988.96s -> 6991.28s]  I can give you guys a really good example of what just happened
[6992.16s -> 6996.24s]  I overstayed and when I overstayed I didn't actually get anything out of it
[6996.64s -> 6999.52s]  Like I got what you saw. I just have extra gold for nothing
[6999.92s -> 7003.12s]  So now I just have extra gold, right and because I have extra gold
[7003.20s -> 7006.00s]  The jinn actually gets a net positive because they stopped my back
[7006.40s -> 7010.32s]  So he gets a free plate here. I miss a cannon and even though i'm still up 10 cs
[7011.04s -> 7014.88s]  It's like I could have been up 10 cs not given a plate and not
[7015.52s -> 7016.88s]  Missed a cannon
[7016.88s -> 7018.88s]  So it's it's basically like
[7020.00s -> 7022.00s]  It's interesting
[7022.88s -> 7026.64s]  Should you get prio for your jungler every game? No, no, that's not important
[7027.36s -> 7030.08s]  Some games prio is important
[7030.16s -> 7035.60s]  It's very important some games, but you don't need to always be thinking about getting prio for jungler
[7035.92s -> 7040.96s]  That's not something you should be like thinking about like always, right? Like you think about it in terms of like timers
[7041.52s -> 7046.56s]  That's important, but prio for jungler always is not like something you should be
[7047.36s -> 7049.36s]  worrying about
[7049.76s -> 7059.04s]  Because if you're perma shoving and you're like, oh I have prio for my jungler, but then your jungler doesn't do anything
[7060.00s -> 7063.12s]  Like having that prio if you don't have prio it doesn't do anything
[7065.36s -> 7070.64s]  Like I'd rather hold the wave in like a certain spot. Oh my god, I suck
[7080.16s -> 7082.16s]  I
[7101.76s -> 7107.60s]  Mean it worked out I think if I was six I triple killed them there, but
[7108.00s -> 7110.00s]  I think we actually
[7110.88s -> 7114.00s]  Almost I think we actually triple killed them too if Lulu helps me, but again
[7114.96s -> 7116.96s]  You guys know what I'm gonna say I go back to the thing
[7137.60s -> 7139.60s]  I
[7160.16s -> 7162.16s]  Don't know if Rengar has ulti or not
[7162.88s -> 7164.88s]  I
[7166.56s -> 7168.56s]  Want to shove this because
[7175.44s -> 7177.44s]  Chill
[7182.80s -> 7186.64s]  I want to shove it in for a second and I really don't have anything to do so I'll just stand here
[7187.04s -> 7189.04s]  You want to also be back backed
[7190.00s -> 7191.76s]  Once it's hit for when to buy boots
[7191.76s -> 7195.76s]  I bought boots a felios. You can buy boots really early. He's like he's a champion where
[7196.40s -> 7200.80s]  The more attacks you do is actually very valuable and positioning on a felios is very important
[7201.36s -> 7203.12s]  It's kind of like um
[7203.12s -> 7207.36s]  Some ad carries like you don't need boots really early like like with like jinx for example
[7207.36s -> 7208.88s]  I usually go free boots
[7208.88s -> 7213.68s]  Right, or I go boots like after my kraken but with a felios
[7214.64s -> 7217.84s]  Uh, I really like the early mobility the early trading
[7218.56s -> 7220.56s]  Stuff like that
[7224.40s -> 7231.04s]  Okay, so always be watching the map too. We see the Rengar's top right we can actually just straight fight these guys 2v2 right now
[7232.16s -> 7234.16s]  Uh, what?
[7238.24s -> 7240.24s]  Wait what
[7241.20s -> 7245.84s]  What's my Lulu doing homie what what are we he's ulting us
[7248.16s -> 7250.16s]  Oh
[7257.04s -> 7261.52s]  So you're saying helping the ad carry is bad got it
[7268.88s -> 7271.52s]  I can't believe my lulu just walked away from me
[7272.56s -> 7275.84s]  And just like watched like you work as a team
[7276.16s -> 7279.28s]  This is something that I cannot stress enough
[7281.84s -> 7283.84s]  Play as a team
[7284.40s -> 7286.40s]  When you play league of legends
[7286.40s -> 7290.40s]  This tells me more than anything because this happens even in grandmaster
[7290.40s -> 7294.40s]  I see teammates who will be selfish and not help each other
[7295.12s -> 7297.12s]  Just help each other
[7297.68s -> 7300.88s]  Help each other please man. We are a team
[7301.52s -> 7306.72s]  Don't just run and leave your adc
[7309.76s -> 7312.32s]  Like i'm not even flaming you but like dude you can't do that
[7313.60s -> 7319.04s]  You can't be upset that like like I can't dodge every spell right to the league
[7319.12s -> 7322.08s]  I feel like something that I noticed that happens a lot in league now
[7322.08s -> 7329.28s]  This is players will have this weirdly high expectation for everyone to play absolutely perfect at all times
[7329.60s -> 7334.40s]  And and they want me to like be gumiasi and I'm like dude
[7335.20s -> 7338.48s]  I dodged two of the gin bullets. I dodged a karma queue
[7339.76s -> 7344.40s]  Like you literally like I can't dodge literally everything will slow right like that's not how it works
[7352.88s -> 7355.44s]  Like dude I'm gonna lose my mind with this guy
[7359.28s -> 7361.28s]  I
[7361.28s -> 7363.28s]  I
[7385.44s -> 7387.84s]  Will is blaming me
[7392.24s -> 7394.24s]  It's okay
[7395.20s -> 7403.92s]  It's okay. I don't need to be upset. It's fine the lulu player is totally okay
[7408.88s -> 7416.40s]  You know sometimes people think they're right it's just what happens in the worlds
[7421.76s -> 7428.24s]  Right it's just it is what it is no big deal
[7442.16s -> 7447.44s]  Sorry, I'm trying really hard to not be an asshole right now this lulu player is making me like
[7448.40s -> 7452.08s]  Making me want to like fund Thanos. You know what I mean like this guy is like making me
[7453.52s -> 7455.52s]  Like this guy like we talk about
[7455.84s -> 7458.96s]  We like in league we talk about like the players
[7459.92s -> 7462.08s]  Like we talk about ad carry players having ego
[7463.12s -> 7465.12s]  I genuinely think
[7465.52s -> 7471.36s]  Support players have five times the ego ad carry players have but with like a third of the skill
[7471.76s -> 7473.76s]  I
[7475.52s -> 7477.84s]  Think ad carry players do have massive egos
[7480.40s -> 7482.40s]  But again, I don't think that like
[7483.12s -> 7487.60s]  I think support players are genuinely the dumbest motherfucking humans on the planet
[7488.16s -> 7492.96s]  And they think that they're the best players to ever touch the game and it hurts my fucking balls
[7501.36s -> 7503.36s]  I
[7515.12s -> 7520.00s]  Hey, would you be willing to have a
[7521.52s -> 7523.52s]  Vod review
[7523.60s -> 7525.92s]  With me in discord after the game
[7526.96s -> 7529.92s]  Let's just see I want to see if like this person is willing to listen to reason
[7532.08s -> 7534.08s]  Let's see
[7557.04s -> 7559.52s]  I'm trying to not tilt but it's really frustrating
[7559.92s -> 7563.76s]  Because this player is playing specifically for kda
[7565.44s -> 7571.20s]  And they're playing like they don't understand how like I can already tell you if I go look at this person's op.g
[7571.76s -> 7574.96s]  They only play for kda. I can tell you right now right here
[7575.52s -> 7579.36s]  This person plays only for kda never takes any risks
[7579.92s -> 7584.24s]  Doesn't ever help their ad carry ever when they get behind doesn't ever walk up to like
[7584.72s -> 7586.32s]  Try and fight doesn't do any of that
[7586.56s -> 7590.16s]  I can tell you right now without even looking at their op.g from how this person plays
[7590.72s -> 7593.68s]  That they have high kda is but really low win rate
[7598.40s -> 7600.72s]  But I don't want my entire stream to be bitching about this Lulu
[7600.72s -> 7602.72s]  So we'll try and focus on how to win from this position
[7603.60s -> 7607.92s]  So i'm sure you guys get shitty supports too. So we'll try and focus on how to win from the current position we're in
[7616.56s -> 7625.20s]  Yeah, it doesn't get better. I mean I'll be honest with you my grandmaster supports on my main suck
[7625.36s -> 7627.36s]  Like it doesn't get better
[7627.44s -> 7633.12s]  They get better like mechanically at the game right like the higher elo supports get better mechanically
[7633.76s -> 7636.32s]  But they get worse they don't get better when like
[7637.52s -> 7641.68s]  It doesn't get better. It's always like you'll either have a really good support or you'll have somebody who sniffs glue
[7647.28s -> 7650.24s]  All right, I'm just dead
[7653.36s -> 7655.36s]  Or I'm not dead
[7673.52s -> 7675.52s]  Okay
[7676.96s -> 7683.44s]  Honestly our biggest issue here is I need to get bloodthirster ASAP once I get BT the game gets a lot easier
[7692.48s -> 7694.48s]  We could kill this guy right now
[7694.80s -> 7697.20s]  If the Lulu helps me we can actually just straight kill these guys
[7698.32s -> 7703.36s]  Because I can ulti to heal myself right we have Lulu ult I have ult to heal myself and I'm strong
[7703.52s -> 7707.92s]  She has ignite I have ult I have everything we could easily
[7709.76s -> 7711.76s]  Kill that that Taliyah right there
[7713.60s -> 7716.88s]  I mean yeah, whatever man, this is what I'm talking about
[7721.44s -> 7728.24s]  Again, are you willing to get into discord and vod review? Yes or no
[7733.36s -> 7735.36s]  I
[7737.04s -> 7739.04s]  Mean I have to be honest with you
[7741.20s -> 7743.92s]  The reason this is frustrating is because as an adc player
[7744.48s -> 7747.04s]  You want to be able to rely on your support right?
[7747.76s -> 7752.56s]  You want to be able to make plays go in fight and rely on your teammates because as an adc player
[7753.20s -> 7755.60s]  Support an ad or like a duo right like you want to play it together
[7757.52s -> 7759.52s]  No, no man. I'm not attacking you
[7760.56s -> 7763.12s]  I'm saying let's discord after
[7764.32s -> 7768.48s]  You can explain your POV and I'll explain mine
[7775.68s -> 7782.08s]  Maybe we can like improve this player like get them to be a better player and not ruin every game they play in
[7784.16s -> 7786.16s]  Like that would be that would be the goat
[7786.88s -> 7794.32s]  Like the app that did not hit me by the way that hip-hop should be us but
[7803.92s -> 7805.92s]  I don't even understand
[7810.08s -> 7812.08s]  Oh man
[7816.88s -> 7818.88s]  This is the person's
[7821.60s -> 7823.76s]  By the way, this is the person so be dodgy g
[7825.04s -> 7830.32s]  Average win rate 50% win rate like I said has really good kda's on all his champs
[7832.00s -> 7834.00s]  But he doesn't win
[7834.88s -> 7836.88s]  I'm telling you right now
[7836.96s -> 7840.96s]  The biggest thing in league that the fakest thing in league of legends
[7841.92s -> 7844.64s]  Is believing that you are a good player based on kda
[7846.32s -> 7849.28s]  If I go look at any challenger level support player right now
[7850.08s -> 7852.08s]  Their kda's will be like
[7852.48s -> 7854.48s]  four
[7854.48s -> 7858.00s]  They'll still have good kda, but it'll be like four and three and it'll be on
[7859.52s -> 7861.28s]  That's your mutual
[7861.28s -> 7863.28s]  I'm gonna be real with you right now t
[7864.00s -> 7865.92s]  This lulu player
[7865.92s -> 7868.24s]  Like I you could tell me that this person
[7869.04s -> 7872.88s]  Sniffed glue as a kid and their parents never told them to stop and I would believe you
[7873.92s -> 7875.92s]  I'm not even meaning like I would say that makes sense
[7877.12s -> 7880.40s]  I mean like I said, I don't I don't even care. I don't care if it's a girl a guy
[7881.04s -> 7886.24s]  The e-girl thing is like that doesn't bother me right like it could be a girl a guy a pigeon they could they could fucking
[7887.04s -> 7888.16s]  They could
[7888.16s -> 7892.96s]  Relate as a fucking peanut in a in a fucking plane. I don't care about that at all
[7896.24s -> 7898.24s]  You don't mean like so that shit doesn't bother me at all
[7899.44s -> 7903.84s]  Like them like I actually think it's stupid when people are like, oh, it's an e-girl e-guy like I
[7904.40s -> 7906.40s]  I think that's dumb as shit
[7906.40s -> 7908.40s]  Because that argument's so crap
[7908.40s -> 7911.68s]  Because like I don't give a shit if it's a guy or girl because like, you know what I mean
[7911.68s -> 7915.04s]  I'm more upset at the fact that this person is delusional than anything
[7916.08s -> 7918.08s]  That's like what's tilting me
[7928.56s -> 7930.56s]  Here I'm just gonna mute
[7930.80s -> 7935.76s]  We'll do one more game on this account after this game and I'm gonna mute from the start of the game for you guys, okay?
[7942.64s -> 7945.20s]  Dude if he didn't actually get me into the wall there
[7945.20s -> 7949.52s]  I tried to walk forward so that I wouldn't get condemned in the wall if he didn't stun me I kill him
[7950.32s -> 7952.32s]  Ah, that's annoying
[7952.88s -> 7956.08s]  That was actually such a good hitbox for him my bad
[7960.56s -> 7975.68s]  Nice huge shut down nice job. If you're wondering why I'm even here by the way. I'm actually I'm not trolling
[7976.24s -> 7981.52s]  I'm trying to get this turret because this gives me a lot of gold at the moment. I'm not actually worth that much gold
[7981.92s -> 7984.72s]  There's nothing going on on the map. There's no objective or anything like that, right?
[7985.12s -> 7987.84s]  So I'm trying to push in top waves right now so that I can get gold
[7988.40s -> 7992.40s]  To try and like hyper inflate my two item before this next dragon
[7993.12s -> 7997.20s]  Because this next dragon is going to be incredibly important if we if we want any chance to win
[7998.32s -> 8000.32s]  We have to win this next dragon
[8000.40s -> 8003.68s]  And the only way for me to do that is to either get really lucky
[8005.04s -> 8007.04s]  Or go get some gold and a side win
[8007.84s -> 8010.24s]  It's just support difference every game it is
[8010.96s -> 8012.48s]  I want to point this out
[8012.48s -> 8015.36s]  This person is playing this victim complex bullshit
[8015.36s -> 8018.34s]  Like you know what I mean, but it is it is actually support death
[8046.32s -> 8057.04s]  Sorry, I'm tilted. I'm playing bad this game
[8058.80s -> 8061.76s]  I need to mute these players because these players are actually tilting me
[8063.36s -> 8066.88s]  Like I was fine with it before but I'm actually getting a little irritated. That's made me play bad
[8067.92s -> 8070.00s]  So I need to mute them so I don't keep inting
[8072.32s -> 8074.96s]  Like it's affecting my gameplay and it's it's pissing me off
[8076.00s -> 8078.00s]  That's just my bad
[8086.00s -> 8088.00s]  T split are you here T?
[8088.88s -> 8090.88s]  Yo T message this Lulu
[8091.60s -> 8094.64s]  I mean this in the nicest way. I don't even want to be toxic
[8095.44s -> 8097.44s]  I genuinely want to use this for content
[8101.04s -> 8103.04s]  Like this guy's been flaming me the whole game
[8103.36s -> 8105.92s]  Like I want to use this for content to show you guys that
[8106.40s -> 8109.44s]  It is so easy to tell people how the game should be played
[8110.16s -> 8113.20s]  So easy if you if you can communicate by talking
[8116.96s -> 8122.24s]  Because this guy's been doing nothing but flaming me the entire game this little right, but he's an absolute
[8122.80s -> 8124.80s]  Like he played the lane completely bad
[8125.20s -> 8127.60s]  Then he then he stopped trying to win
[8128.48s -> 8131.36s]  Stop shielding me stop doing anything right after he played the lane bad
[8133.84s -> 8138.40s]  Then he started playing the victim thing when I asked him to be a human and like come over and like help me and play teamwork
[8138.80s -> 8140.80s]  You gotta remember I didn't flame him a single time
[8141.20s -> 8144.72s]  Right like I didn't say a single negative thing to this guy in game. I said let's work as a team
[8145.44s -> 8147.44s]  He got upset
[8150.72s -> 8156.80s]  Like I genuinely think it'd be great content if I could talk to this guy on discord and just like oh, I'd be so good
[8163.60s -> 8165.60s]  I
[8174.16s -> 8176.96s]  Dude, I'm I'm trying to kill these people guys
[8179.44s -> 8184.32s]  That wasn't bad though, we got 800 golden not the worst, but I don't know if my team can stall this
[8185.28s -> 8187.28s]  Maybe if they can like kill this they can stall it, but
[8187.28s -> 8196.00s]  No, they're yeah, that's that's gg that was a disgusting tolly. I know you
[8217.52s -> 8219.52s]  You
[8234.16s -> 8238.08s]  All right, I'm gonna add him and he'll probably not add me but I might as well try
[8241.04s -> 8243.04s]  This would be such a good learning experience
[8247.36s -> 8249.36s]  Oh
[8252.48s -> 8256.64s]  Excuse me dude, I've had like bad heartburn today. I need to take one of those heartburn pills
[8262.56s -> 8266.96s]  What Lulu what man just say just let it out let it out
[8269.84s -> 8273.28s]  Let it out baby yo, Lulu
[8274.16s -> 8277.20s]  Let's just just have a talk
[8280.16s -> 8287.76s]  Yo, let's discord we can bother of you since I'm so bad
[8290.88s -> 8292.88s]  Yeah
[8297.52s -> 8299.52s]  Trust
[8300.32s -> 8312.00s]  You you just blamed everyone by yourself, but you didn't play correctly at all
[8315.12s -> 8320.64s]  You played lane completely wrong didn't help each other
[8322.88s -> 8325.20s]  Left people to die on repeats
[8327.04s -> 8329.04s]  Then played victim
[8329.52s -> 8331.52s]  You
[8339.04s -> 8341.44s]  I genuinely want to help you
[8359.92s -> 8361.92s]  You
[8366.08s -> 8373.84s]  This guy screenshotted what I just said and put it in the the endgame chat
[8382.56s -> 8386.40s]  What is happening right now what is going on
[8387.12s -> 8392.48s]  There is no way that this is not an npc
[8399.92s -> 8405.52s]  There is no way this is not an npc. There's no way
[8407.52s -> 8409.52s]  There's no way
[8409.68s -> 8411.68s]  There's no way
[8414.48s -> 8423.68s]  It's Geronimo Lamal it is me yes, bro just come talk in discord. I'm not even gonna flame you
[8430.08s -> 8432.08s]  What does this even mean
[8432.64s -> 8438.96s]  Bro, I don't think I've seen anybody more insecure in my life
[8441.04s -> 8447.76s]  Bro you are so insecure it's cringe how insecure you are
[8451.04s -> 8460.72s]  Like oof good luck man on the climb to masters, but Jesus christ
[8462.80s -> 8464.80s]  That's sad
[8466.72s -> 8468.24s]  Oh
[8468.24s -> 8470.24s]  God I
[8470.24s -> 8472.24s]  Dude, I don't even know what to say like I'm gonna be real
[8472.80s -> 8477.12s]  I was like I'm not even gonna flame the guy right I just genuinely want to like
[8478.00s -> 8480.00s]  improve the community
[8480.96s -> 8484.88s]  Because that was three straight supports in a row. They didn't know how to play lulu
[8485.76s -> 8490.64s]  And I'm not even gonna flame the guy's skill. He's not a lulu player right? He doesn't play lulu. That's fine
[8491.12s -> 8495.20s]  But the issue was that I had with that guy specifically was that
[8496.00s -> 8498.00s]  It's okay to be bad at the game
[8498.24s -> 8499.12s]  Right
[8499.12s -> 8501.68s]  There's nothing wrong with being bad at league everybody has bad games
[8502.16s -> 8506.00s]  But when we're playing a game together and you're saying it's winnable and you want to win the game
[8506.40s -> 8508.40s]  You can't pick and choose
[8508.96s -> 8510.96s]  Who to like help win the game
[8511.92s -> 8519.20s]  Like if I'm sitting there bot lane we're both being dove by jinn and you're intentionally trying not to take damage and not die
[8519.76s -> 8521.76s]  Because you want to value your kda
[8522.32s -> 8524.08s]  over everything else
[8524.08s -> 8526.88s]  So that I you know what hold on let me think about this
[8528.48s -> 8530.48s]  I think I figured this person out
[8531.68s -> 8534.40s]  This person lives in delusion and I think I figured this out
[8534.40s -> 8539.12s]  Let me let me explain this a lot of players do this, but I think I'm figuring this out as I'm as I'm thinking about this
[8540.16s -> 8542.16s]  so
[8542.16s -> 8546.08s]  This person has really good kda's on their profile right this like this eye catching person
[8546.40s -> 8548.40s]  They've really really good kda's on their profile, right?
[8549.36s -> 8553.44s]  This person doesn't ever take risks doesn't ever do anything
[8554.16s -> 8557.84s]  To try and win the game outside of like just like existing and hitting buttons
[8560.88s -> 8563.76s]  And what they do is they will always have good kda's
[8564.64s -> 8567.84s]  And they will they will sit here and never like I know why they're losing
[8568.40s -> 8573.28s]  They will sit here and they will do this shit where they have good kda's they they don't ever die that much blah blah blah
[8574.08s -> 8578.56s]  But what they do is they lie to themselves and they say look how good my kda's are
[8579.36s -> 8581.36s]  If I had better teammates, I'd always win
[8584.88s -> 8586.16s]  Like
[8586.16s -> 8588.16s]  I cracked the code actually
[8588.88s -> 8592.08s]  That's totally what it is the players actually like
[8592.72s -> 8596.40s]  Play so safe and they play to like for statistics, right?
[8596.80s -> 8598.80s]  They play like purely for the stats
[8599.36s -> 8604.56s]  And then they can say that it was their team's fault that they didn't win because they played
[8605.36s -> 8607.36s]  Really bad, but they didn't die
[8610.00s -> 8616.88s]  Because I mean in theory I could have a perfect kda on every ad carry I play
[8617.60s -> 8623.68s]  Right, all I'd have to do is literally walk walk up get one kill and then afk and stand in the base the rest of the game
[8625.52s -> 8628.08s]  And I could be like yo, why is my team not able to carry? What's happening?
[8631.36s -> 8636.48s]  Right like you could literally do that. No, I seriously think the person's self gaslighting himself
[8636.72s -> 8643.28s]  Like I'm serious. I think this person's like self gaslighting where they they're like, oh, it's my team's fault every game
[8643.76s -> 8647.84s]  Right, like they're always blaming their team for their their their loses and their mistakes and shits
[8648.24s -> 8650.24s]  and it's sad because like
[8650.24s -> 8653.04s]  There's a reason you're d2 and I'm not saying that to be toxic
[8653.04s -> 8655.36s]  I'm saying that like you haven't improved in four years
[8655.76s -> 8659.36s]  And you haven't improved because all you're doing is playing to blame your team every single game
[8659.68s -> 8664.40s]  When I just saw like 500 mistakes that you made that we could have won the game off of early game
[8666.72s -> 8668.72s]  You
[8671.52s -> 8674.24s]  Here I remember somebody wanted me to play a Caitlyn game last game
[8674.96s -> 8676.96s]  So, uh, we're gonna play kate
[8677.68s -> 8680.88s]  I don't remember. I don't remember who it was in the chat somebody's like two people said kate
[8681.60s -> 8683.60s]  But uh, we'll do a kate game for you guys
[8684.08s -> 8686.08s]  Uh, I got your boys. Don't worry
[8696.96s -> 8698.96s]  All right, I'm gonna take
[8699.84s -> 8706.80s]  Ghost flash because they have three melee champs four melee champs. They have they have recon zed clad gragas. So I'm gonna take a ghost flash
[8708.16s -> 8710.16s]  These are gonna be my runes this game
[8710.32s -> 8713.36s]  I'm gonna take a little more mr because I don't think we're gonna be fighting too much in lane
[8713.60s -> 8715.60s]  We're pretty much just gonna be poking them
[8715.84s -> 8717.04s]  With karma kate
[8717.20s -> 8721.28s]  So I'm gonna take a little bit extra mr because I'm gonna be playing for mid delay game. I'm just scaling
[8721.28s -> 8723.28s]  And these are gonna be the runes that I take
[8734.48s -> 8737.04s]  Giving class on adc or the easier to play ones
[8737.60s -> 8742.32s]  In adc, uh, I usually do like when I'm playing on this account right now. This is like my teaching account
[8743.28s -> 8748.00s]  It's a little lower mmR. Right. It's like d1 low masters. I usually, uh, play
[8748.24s -> 8753.76s]  80 carries that like the chat wants to see me play so that you guys can learn like good and bad matchups and things like that's
[8755.44s -> 8759.44s]  The last two games I got way too tilted by shenny support players
[8760.32s -> 8765.20s]  Like egos and all that shit. I got way too frustrated and I played bad the last two games. So we're gonna
[8766.16s -> 8768.72s]  Honestly, I'm just gonna I think I'm just gonna mute these people at the very start of the game
[8769.52s -> 8774.32s]  Normally, I wouldn't suggest you mute people because you like playing as a team is really important
[8774.88s -> 8778.88s]  Because like, you know, you need to communicate and all that shit, but I am just like I'm gonna mute them
[8780.80s -> 8782.80s]  Because I
[8782.88s -> 8786.80s]  Dude, my mental is taking a fucking hit right now. So we're gonna just chill and play
[8790.64s -> 8795.76s]  I just don't know how to play nauta. I think that was really good. I just don't I don't know how to play her
[8797.20s -> 8799.20s]  I think she's a great champ
[8800.08s -> 8802.08s]  I think she's a great champ
[8804.16s -> 8810.16s]  Like I've been getting shit on by nila on my main account like a lot of grandmaster nyla's have been dumbstaring me
[8820.08s -> 8822.64s]  I think she's just really good at abusing solo queue
[8823.76s -> 8825.76s]  Like the the issue with nila
[8825.84s -> 8828.32s]  Is from what I've seen all the losses I've had with nila
[8829.36s -> 8832.08s]  People don't um, it's like the thing I was telling you about before
[8833.04s -> 8835.04s]  People don't play aggressively
[8835.44s -> 8841.04s]  In the lower elos like even in grandmaster people don't play like aggressively enough. It sounds crazy to say that but it's true
[8841.68s -> 8846.00s]  They don't play aggressively enough in lane so you can get away with just picking nila and scaling
[8846.48s -> 8850.72s]  And nila at like one item you'll always be up in levels, right because that's how the champion works
[8852.32s -> 8855.60s]  The champion works and like you'll always be up in levels because of her passive so
[8855.76s -> 8862.72s]  You basically just like scale through existing. It's pretty it's pretty interesting
[8864.48s -> 8866.48s]  All right, so we're playing cake karma
[8868.96s -> 8872.64s]  Oh, I missed the minion because I suck I'm gonna ward this bush
[8874.48s -> 8876.64s]  Uh, just because I don't want the recon in the bush
[8877.52s -> 8879.52s]  So
[8884.16s -> 8889.84s]  Now that the bush isn't warded anymore, um, okay, what are the nice I was gonna say what I want to do is I actually want to play
[8892.24s -> 8893.44s]  Oh, I suck
[8893.44s -> 8895.68s]  I actually wanted to play. Oh man. I'm so bad at kate
[8895.92s -> 8900.48s]  I wanted to play on the top side of the wave so that I'm not standing near the bushes, right
[8901.12s -> 8903.12s]  Because if you stand near the bushes
[8904.00s -> 8908.32s]  The recon can obviously like w me and I just get fucked so I'd rather play in a safer spot
[8909.60s -> 8911.60s]  I can't believe I missed 2cs. I'm so fucking bad
[8912.64s -> 8916.72s]  Now I want to push in wave 3 and I want to go buy a call so I'm gonna ping to push
[8925.60s -> 8931.84s]  Okay, so I actually want to back here and I'm gonna go buy a call so this is called a cheater recall
[8933.52s -> 8937.20s]  You usually have perfect cs to back on this timer
[8938.08s -> 8940.08s]  Go and you can go buy a call. Okay
[8940.56s -> 8944.24s]  This is like something that you can do if you're in a lane that's going to be perma shoving
[8944.72s -> 8946.72s]  So what happens is the reason it's called the cheater recall
[8947.28s -> 8953.04s]  Is because we push the wave in they had to stay and form the wave, right now watch
[8956.32s -> 8961.36s]  They have to push this wave in right now if karma was here instead of roaming this roam is fine by the way
[8961.60s -> 8964.16s]  But if she was here instead of roaming she could actually hold the wave
[8965.52s -> 8970.24s]  And if you notice here, I don't actually miss that many minions, right? We're chillin
[8974.96s -> 8979.04s]  Now we can slow push this we're safe I should actually fast push this
[8980.08s -> 8987.92s]  Because I wanted to bounce I don't want to slow push this but I can't uh, I can't fast push this at level 3 by myself
[8992.32s -> 8994.32s]  So we're just gonna chill
[8994.72s -> 8997.76s]  Kaelin's really good at abusing like early lane phase
[8998.32s -> 9003.52s]  Bullying just based on like what our kit does. We see recon on the map top side. You get you see that
[9004.80s -> 9006.80s]  So because we see recon
[9008.08s -> 9011.20s]  I can walk up a bit and we could play a little aggro here
[9011.76s -> 9013.76s]  You
[9014.24s -> 9019.52s]  Can kind of see like I don't have to play behind the minion wave you see what I'm doing to this guy, right?
[9020.96s -> 9023.84s]  I hate this game. We can quit we can we can forfeit. It's fun
[9027.12s -> 9029.12s]  I hate this game
[9030.00s -> 9032.00s]  I really hate this game
[9032.00s -> 9035.12s]  Dude, what is wrong with me right now? It's like my brain doesn't work
[9038.08s -> 9040.08s]  It's the two of us that are here
[9041.20s -> 9043.20s]  280 k nerf tellin you
[9047.52s -> 9049.52s]  So recon's gonna be bot right now
[9050.88s -> 9053.68s]  I know he's gonna be bot uh, so I need to be a little care
[9054.96s -> 9056.96s]  Now my karma is here
[9059.20s -> 9062.32s]  There we go, so you notice how I didn't use any spells. I'm not I'm just chillin
[9065.84s -> 9068.40s]  Dude are you kidding me man?
[9068.64s -> 9074.24s]  I'm gonna be honest. I'm getting really tilted by these players now
[9074.96s -> 9076.96s]  Like the recon w's in
[9077.36s -> 9080.08s]  They just stand there and watch me die
[9081.60s -> 9085.52s]  Okay, it's fine. Listen, I'm not gonna get too mad about it. It's fine. I should have flashed the knockup
[9085.84s -> 9089.12s]  I guess even though in reality I should never have to flash the knockup
[9089.60s -> 9092.24s]  But I I should have flashed it because I can't trust the teammates
[9092.72s -> 9096.72s]  So what I'm saying is right there karma and fiddle were both right here. I was being chased down
[9097.20s -> 9101.52s]  They they stood here. They didn't they didn't walk up to do anything. They just stood and waited
[9102.88s -> 9105.44s]  That pisses me off because I hate when players
[9106.64s -> 9108.40s]  play
[9108.40s -> 9110.96s]  Selfish and scared. It's my biggest pet peeve
[9113.92s -> 9118.80s]  It drives me fucking crazy man, sorry, I'm getting I'm losing my mind
[9122.80s -> 9124.80s]  Like it's so easy
[9125.12s -> 9129.76s]  Let's wrap this up. It's fine though. I I shouldn't have walked up and ego did it's on me
[9140.72s -> 9142.72s]  Okay, I want to soul push this wave
[9143.84s -> 9145.84s]  Stay out of my way
[9148.80s -> 9150.80s]  Yeah, I'm losing it
[9151.04s -> 9158.00s]  This by the way would be an example of a bad time for karma to run. She needs to come back bot
[9162.16s -> 9164.16s]  There's absolutely no reason for it to roam on that timer
[9165.28s -> 9168.56s]  There's also no reason for it to be in that bush over there. We should be playing up to try
[9168.64s -> 9172.72s]  We're playing k karma, right? We should be playing forward so that we can actually be aggressive
[9173.92s -> 9175.20s]  K karma's a lane bully lane
[9175.20s -> 9179.12s]  We don't want to sit here and just do nothing if you pick karma you want to be aggressive
[9179.12s -> 9182.96s]  You want to be playing up you want to be stunning you want to be doing like aggressive things playing the game
[9186.40s -> 9189.04s]  We're level six. I'd really like to like go in. Yeah, like
[9196.96s -> 9201.36s]  That was actually not bad by the karma she w'd the zaya and then I got to trap off of it
[9201.36s -> 9203.36s]  So that wasn't too bad
[9203.60s -> 9205.60s]  Not the worst
[9209.44s -> 9213.44s]  Not not bad
[9216.64s -> 9229.44s]  That was good that was good really nice really nice. Okay, so I'm gonna back here because I don't want to overstay for the wave
[9239.12s -> 9241.12s]  I
[9243.28s -> 9245.28s]  Got boots
[9247.92s -> 9249.92s]  You don't think a lot of it is too
[9250.64s -> 9254.80s]  I think a lot of it is people get really scared when they like rakan is really strong in this meta, right?
[9254.80s -> 9258.48s]  Like he's very very powerful. He's he's like numbers are a little too high right now
[9258.48s -> 9260.40s]  So like everything he does is just a little too good
[9260.96s -> 9266.24s]  So I think people get nervous around rakan, especially with zaya because it's like when people would get nervous around non-illusion
[9266.48s -> 9269.28s]  The lane like plays itself. It's very strong. It's very hard to beat
[9269.84s -> 9273.76s]  But you can still see people making mistakes when they play the lane. So you got to watch for that type of stuff
[9280.24s -> 9283.44s]  Now a good way to play against a zaya once you hit six
[9287.76s -> 9289.76s]  Is you don't want to
[9291.36s -> 9293.44s]  You don't want to ever walk melee range of her
[9293.92s -> 9296.16s]  Or give her the ability to just kill you with the feathers
[9296.88s -> 9298.88s]  your main goal here is going to be
[9299.12s -> 9301.12s]  Try and stay in a good spot when it comes to
[9302.16s -> 9304.16s]  Feathers like I want to be to the side of her
[9304.64s -> 9308.64s]  The side of her is the best option like where she can't pull in like I'll get hit by maybe a few
[9309.04s -> 9311.04s]  But she can't pull in all of them
[9312.64s -> 9314.32s]  That's a really
[9314.32s -> 9317.60s]  Key thing when playing versus her because I remember back in the day
[9317.60s -> 9320.32s]  I didn't know how to play for saya and I would always get fucking frustrated as shit
[9321.20s -> 9324.00s]  So rakan's five. I want to hit tab see rakan's five
[9324.96s -> 9326.96s]  We shouldn't be able to die here
[9329.68s -> 9333.92s]  I want to push this wave in but I also need to stay away from where the rakan could be
[9336.00s -> 9338.32s]  So if you want to push waves in and reset the wave
[9339.12s -> 9340.24s]  Uh
[9340.24s -> 9344.00s]  Make sure that you're standing as far away as you can from where they can engage on you
[9349.04s -> 9352.48s]  Now they're about to be six rakan is so they have a really strong level six
[9352.48s -> 9356.80s]  She has pickaxe and noon quiver. We do want to be a little hesitant here. We don't want to fight
[9358.48s -> 9360.64s]  Now i'm gonna kind of push this in a bit
[9361.76s -> 9365.52s]  We should have been spam pushing the whole wave because that's how k karma plays. We just push
[9366.24s -> 9368.08s]  push push push
[9368.08s -> 9371.36s]  But we played uh that that early roam by karma
[9372.80s -> 9374.80s]  Kind of put us behind on that
[9375.44s -> 9379.44s]  It's not a big deal. It's just something that we have to adjust
[9383.20s -> 9385.60s]  Why does this say 88 and this say 90
[9388.08s -> 9390.08s]  Which one is it?
[9397.92s -> 9399.92s]  Is it 88 or 90
[9407.44s -> 9409.44s]  I mean that guy's dead
[9410.16s -> 9412.16s]  I don't know what that karma's thinking but
[9413.44s -> 9415.92s]  Uh we probably have to give this drake
[9420.00s -> 9424.88s]  I mean, maybe we could fight it if fiddle had ulti but him not having ult. Yeah, there's no way
[9431.04s -> 9434.00s]  The higher one counts ward kills why?
[9436.24s -> 9439.12s]  I think that's so stupid so they might try and engage here
[9439.84s -> 9446.16s]  Unless they somehow know fiddles in the bush, which would be impressive because we know it's not warded
[9448.32s -> 9450.32s]  So that'd be pretty impressive if they knew that
[9464.24s -> 9465.76s]  We could actually ref
[9469.60s -> 9472.80s]  I'm just gonna ghost
[9477.20s -> 9481.04s]  This is crazy what the fuck oh, this is interesting
[9486.16s -> 9490.24s]  They saw fed a hundred percent. Yeah, I don't know where though it must have because he used this thing
[9491.76s -> 9493.76s]  If it'll use his uh, whatever it's called
[9495.84s -> 9498.24s]  His effigy I'd have to go look
[9500.08s -> 9502.08s]  I
[9502.64s -> 9504.64s]  Guess I didn't see it
[9506.16s -> 9508.32s]  Uh, I should back I can get dove here
[9508.80s -> 9512.48s]  We don't know where gregas is like if gregas happens to be like he ease over this wall or something
[9513.20s -> 9516.00s]  I could get dove really easy. I'm greeting really hard
[9517.20s -> 9519.60s]  Greeting usually gets you killed typically
[9520.72s -> 9522.72s]  I shouldn't be doing this
[9524.24s -> 9527.52s]  They're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right
[9528.48s -> 9532.64s]  It's like if you know something it's going to be a bad habit you should not do it
[9535.44s -> 9537.44s]  Just cue the bush
[9538.08s -> 9540.24s]  Okay, that was I meant use like an actual cue
[9543.36s -> 9546.24s]  They could also be in the alcove so I'm a little hesitant, but it's fine
[9552.24s -> 9556.24s]  Okay, so the reason I stayed was because now I have my uh, I have my medic, right
[9557.12s -> 9561.04s]  Because we we finished the coal and we finished the mythic at the same time or finished the wave so
[9562.96s -> 9566.72s]  Now I have two options I go gale force here, uh to dodge a lot of their shits
[9567.52s -> 9570.32s]  Or I can do what sounds like a fun option
[9572.00s -> 9574.00s]  We're gonna do shield bow
[9574.40s -> 9577.04s]  I'm gonna show you guys why I like shield bow on katlyn
[9578.16s -> 9580.16s]  It's not the best mythic
[9580.16s -> 9582.32s]  But it's good into certain comps
[9583.84s -> 9585.84s]  If you don't want to get uh
[9587.20s -> 9589.20s]  Gale
[9589.76s -> 9595.04s]  Because I have a lack already this game. I don't have bloodline, right? So I kind of want to go shield bow
[9600.64s -> 9604.40s]  And then I'm gonna end up going either ie or I'm gonna end up going
[9608.08s -> 9610.80s]  Like bloodthirster seconds ie or bt
[9612.32s -> 9614.32s]  probably ie just because uh
[9615.28s -> 9617.76s]  I think I think it's actually easier to go ie this game
[9624.72s -> 9628.40s]  But yeah, this is a kind of boring game our team's doing really well though, so we just chill
[9636.96s -> 9639.12s]  We got to be a little care, okay
[9645.28s -> 9647.28s]  So
[9655.60s -> 9662.16s]  It was kind of hard to do anything there even though I got like a few autos on the gragas it's a little difficult to actually play the game there
[9667.20s -> 9672.64s]  Because if I walk up too far like see we're cons there if I walk up too far I just get uh killed by rakan
[9675.12s -> 9677.12s]  All right, I'm just gonna reset and go get boots
[9679.84s -> 9684.08s]  Typically ad carry is really fucking boring uh in games like this
[9685.52s -> 9687.52s]  where
[9687.52s -> 9689.52s]  You can't really blow the game open
[9693.04s -> 9697.28s]  Oh, I'm dead maybe wait karma shield me. I'm not dead
[9700.32s -> 9702.32s]  Nice
[9704.80s -> 9706.80s]  Yeah
[9721.44s -> 9724.08s]  Motherfucker co-read me man. Here's like go
[9726.88s -> 9728.88s]  We can fight this though. They have no ults
[9734.40s -> 9738.08s]  Like this is actually fightable. They have no ziyar and no uh draggas are
[9741.92s -> 9746.08s]  And this is also why it's really important that you relay to your team the cooldowns of your team
[9747.04s -> 9749.76s]  Remember that don't forget that if somebody uses a big cooldown
[9750.08s -> 9755.76s]  Tell your team because that was an illegal dragon, right like they just that was one of the most illegal things
[9755.84s -> 9757.84s]  I've seen in a while
[9757.84s -> 9759.92s]  Homie completely grieved that
[9764.32s -> 9766.32s]  Oh
[9778.08s -> 9781.92s]  That's another very very very important thing that you need to take away from playing
[9782.40s -> 9785.04s]  League and being like this is what I was saying about the teamwork and shit earlier
[9786.56s -> 9789.84s]  Being good at the game is a lot of spreading knowledge as well, right
[9790.08s -> 9796.00s]  Like if you if your team doesn't know if a flash is up or down you have to play completely differently, right?
[9796.64s -> 9800.08s]  Like you got to think about the game in that in terms of that as well like how many times have you seen like
[9800.80s -> 9804.16s]  You know, you're like, oh, I can walk up here if this guy can't flash ult me or something, right?
[9808.16s -> 9810.16s]  It happens all the time
[9812.40s -> 9814.88s]  I wonder if I can kill a duskblade zed. I don't know
[9820.16s -> 9822.16s]  I probably could
[9830.96s -> 9832.96s]  Uh, I should go mad
[9835.36s -> 9838.32s]  What do you think about team oh and other top lane as ad carry?
[9840.32s -> 9844.96s]  I play team oh ad carry when I'm playing for fun sometimes. It's okay
[9845.28s -> 9847.28s]  I'm much better
[9848.88s -> 9850.88s]  Fuck
[9854.00s -> 9856.00s]  Yo, go look on your game, man
[9856.40s -> 9860.24s]  So during the mid game is Caitlyn a few things that I can kind of teach you
[9860.32s -> 9863.44s]  This was kind of a boring lane phase, right? Like we didn't really do that much
[9864.00s -> 9869.12s]  The lane phase was essentially just like we died once and then, you know everything all helped real close
[9870.16s -> 9872.16s]  When you're walk up the fights like this
[9872.72s -> 9875.04s]  Make sure that you're putting traps down in places
[9877.36s -> 9879.36s]  Where the enemy has to walk
[9884.48s -> 9885.92s]  Just like that
[9885.92s -> 9890.08s]  playing 80 playing Caitlyn is not always about just like auto-ing and getting queues and shits
[9890.48s -> 9894.00s]  If you noticed during that fight I put two traps here two traps here
[9894.40s -> 9897.84s]  I forced the enemy team into like a location where they had to eat traps
[9898.00s -> 9904.24s]  Or they uh, they can't find us right and even if like
[9907.28s -> 9914.40s]  They avoid the traps they're still having to like move their character in a very unique specific way that they probably don't want to do
[9918.32s -> 9921.28s]  So you should always be thinking where should I put these traps down at the start of the fight
[9921.28s -> 9924.56s]  Not like how do I get autos off think about using your traps to zone
[9925.12s -> 9928.32s]  And that I control the team fight before the fight starts rather than using it to
[9929.84s -> 9933.04s]  Do damage because they'll step in the traps themselves
[9934.16s -> 9937.92s]  People will just people are stupid. They're bad. People aren't paying attention
[9938.64s -> 9940.64s]  Everything I'm bad
[9940.88s -> 9945.04s]  You know what I mean? People can't pay attention to every bush that you're putting traps in during a big fight
[9945.36s -> 9947.84s]  It's it's too much attention span. Nobody has it
[9955.52s -> 9957.52s]  I
[9961.76s -> 9963.76s]  Nice
[9964.08s -> 9966.08s]  I'm gonna go grab this red
[9967.36s -> 9970.00s]  Oh big tip for all the ad carries in chat guys
[9971.04s -> 9972.56s]  I'm gonna tell you right now
[9972.56s -> 9974.56s]  Once the 20 minute mark happens in league
[9975.20s -> 9977.20s]  Your jungler's camps are no longer his
[9978.16s -> 9982.08s]  I know I know junglers are gonna hate me for this. Okay. Listen. If you're a jungle player
[9982.08s -> 9984.96s]  You're like fuck this guy now. I hate him. Listen, you know, it's true
[9985.36s -> 9990.40s]  You know at 20 minutes your camps no longer like they're not yours anymore, man. Okay
[9990.96s -> 9997.52s]  Like you you you are full items at this point. Okay, like I want to be honest you would I'm taking your camps
[10000.32s -> 10002.96s]  I'm trying to get my third item as fast as humanly possible
[10003.12s -> 10014.16s]  Because ad carries spike on three items extremely hard
[10020.96s -> 10024.56s]  Man, I want to walk top but we have no vision of this area so it's a little scary
[10028.72s -> 10030.72s]  Like I said, I typically don't like to take
[10031.60s -> 10033.60s]  Jungles camps early game ever
[10034.24s -> 10035.44s]  Because like
[10035.44s -> 10037.04s]  Like that's why I say like at 20 minutes
[10037.04s -> 10041.68s]  Usually you have two items at this point if you're like farming decent and you know, you know, etc
[10042.24s -> 10046.00s]  Sometimes they'll be faster, but usually it's around average of like you'll have your items at this point
[10048.80s -> 10051.68s]  Always be tabbing to the teamfights even if you're farming as well
[10060.72s -> 10062.72s]  So
[10073.52s -> 10075.52s]  Zed is in this bush
[10079.52s -> 10086.72s]  Wait, where is he wait, I'm stupid. Where'd he go? Oh, he died. I killed him. Wow. I'm really smart
[10090.88s -> 10092.88s]  I
[10092.96s -> 10096.96s]  Like didn't notice that I killed that guy. I'm so dumb
[10102.48s -> 10104.48s]  80 carry brain right boys
[10107.52s -> 10111.28s]  I was like playing that so scared too because I was like I was like is he there
[10121.20s -> 10123.20s]  Pull the dragon out
[10124.00s -> 10132.00s]  Oh, I asked this yesterday, but what do you guys think the coolest looking dragon is I swear it's the uh, I think mountain drake looks fucking sick
[10151.04s -> 10153.04s]  I
[10168.96s -> 10171.84s]  Welcome to the here you saw it. I like the time to push man, right?
[10172.40s -> 10176.48s]  Jera height. Uh, that's mainly because we our karma just got picked off
[10176.48s -> 10183.68s]  And I don't want to give them the option of pushing the wave so by pushing the lane
[10198.72s -> 10200.72s]  Hold on
[10201.04s -> 10207.60s]  Nice by pushing the the lane in it takes away an option for the enemy
[10208.40s -> 10210.64s]  That's something that a lot of people think like oh, I just want farm
[10210.64s -> 10215.04s]  I don't care about the farm right like when I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game
[10215.68s -> 10217.20s]  and I'm pushing like a
[10217.20s -> 10220.80s]  mid mid wave in before a fight if we're just sieging around the baron
[10222.24s -> 10226.64s]  Having that wave pushed in gives them gives us another option. I'm like what we can do in the game
[10227.60s -> 10229.68s]  And it takes you three seconds to push it in so
[10230.80s -> 10232.80s]  If the fight's already over
[10233.44s -> 10237.20s]  And you have time always be paying attention to like trying to push in waves
[10237.76s -> 10242.80s]  So that you can create a little bit of that pressure. Yo, hey, thank you so much for the 14 man. Welcome back
[10243.92s -> 10246.24s]  What do I get next? I kind of want to get bt
[10247.28s -> 10249.28s]  I'm gonna get bt
[10251.52s -> 10254.16s]  I could get doms, but I think bt's better because
[10254.80s -> 10259.12s]  The uh, I already have overheal right so the shield from bt plus shield bow plus ie
[10259.44s -> 10262.08s]  I don't think I'll be able to die. Okay. I think I'm unkillable
[10262.96s -> 10264.96s]  Act actually like actually unkillable
[10266.08s -> 10270.40s]  So here I'm gonna actually give these camps the feddle because he's literally pathing to them. I don't want to be an asshole, but
[10270.64s -> 10272.64s]  I
[10286.08s -> 10288.96s]  Wow, what just happened I'm bad
[10290.64s -> 10292.88s]  I feel like I got hooked by clad
[10294.48s -> 10296.48s]  Oh, he flashed. Okay
[10296.64s -> 10297.76s]  Yeah
[10297.76s -> 10301.76s]  I was like I feel like what just happened was like I mispositioned because like I went up here
[10301.76s -> 10304.96s]  Right like I ghosted one up here because there was two people here two people here
[10305.28s -> 10310.64s]  I put traps down these kind of sloppy traps and then I positioned here and then clad flash cued me under the yeah
[10310.72s -> 10312.72s]  Okay, that makes sense
[10312.72s -> 10314.72s]  I'm just bad
[10316.08s -> 10318.08s]  It was okay though because
[10319.52s -> 10322.32s]  If the entire enemy team has to literally
[10323.12s -> 10330.40s]  Like double flash on you to kill you under the turret and then your team follows up. It's not that big of a deal
[10331.04s -> 10333.04s]  Gale force would have saved me there though. Actually
[10334.56s -> 10336.56s]  Okay
[10339.36s -> 10343.04s]  Gale force totally gonna save me because he has serpents
[10345.76s -> 10350.16s]  Serpents definitely shits on chobo. I'm kind of stupid for going chobo this game
[10353.12s -> 10355.84s]  I wanted to try it out because I when I before when I was playing Caitlyn
[10356.16s -> 10358.88s]  Like before the eye reworking everything everybody would go
[10360.00s -> 10363.60s]  Or there was like one guy in challenger would go shield bow into shit every game
[10364.08s -> 10368.56s]  And I wanted to see if like it was still viable, but there might just be better options now like always scale force
[10369.84s -> 10371.84s]  bt or something
[10374.64s -> 10376.64s]  Oh my god, I flashed late i'm dead
[10376.96s -> 10384.00s]  Dude I flashed late for some reason. I'm so dumb my bad
[10385.76s -> 10387.52s]  I was giving an mb
[10387.52s -> 10389.52s]  Like my brain is moving slowly
[10390.24s -> 10392.24s]  Like I can feel it turning
[10392.96s -> 10394.96s]  I'm just playing bad
[10394.96s -> 10398.32s]  Like I was baiting the clad to go in on me because karma was there
[10398.64s -> 10401.20s]  But what I need to do is I need to trap on top myself when he goes in
[10402.00s -> 10404.00s]  Then I need to flash knit
[10404.00s -> 10406.00s]  And the clutch just dies
[10407.12s -> 10409.12s]  You can also just kill him
[10410.32s -> 10412.56s]  I was gonna say they have nothing
[10415.60s -> 10417.60s]  We just play for dragon here
[10422.24s -> 10425.60s]  I don't know why i'm playing so bad today. I played bad yesterday too. I don't know what's going on
[10426.24s -> 10428.24s]  My like brain is broken
[10437.60s -> 10439.60s]  I
[10445.20s -> 10447.20s]  Dude that recon was trying so hard
[10466.64s -> 10468.64s]  Oh
[10482.72s -> 10484.72s]  I've made so many mistakes this game
[10487.60s -> 10492.32s]  I fucked up positioning mechanics farm all kinds of shit
[10497.60s -> 10501.84s]  I still don't want Lord Dom's actually
[10508.40s -> 10510.40s]  I don't think Lord Dom's is good this game
[10512.40s -> 10515.20s]  Like they have no armor like quite as murk treads
[10517.12s -> 10519.12s]  Which I feel like
[10520.08s -> 10522.08s]  Really bad indoor team, but
[10526.64s -> 10528.64s]  I
[10530.96s -> 10533.28s]  Uh, oh a little tip that you guys can have for Caitlyn too
[10534.24s -> 10536.24s]  when you are
[10536.24s -> 10538.24s]  Like barons up in in 50 seconds, right?
[10538.24s -> 10543.44s]  So a little thing you can do that's actually kind of fun is you want to be at the objective before the like
[10544.00s -> 10545.52s]  Rule with them one of the objectives coming up
[10545.52s -> 10548.32s]  You always want to be on that side of the map before the before the objective comes up
[10549.44s -> 10551.28s]  But
[10551.28s -> 10553.28s]  You can put down traps, uh
[10554.16s -> 10556.16s]  in the bushes
[10556.16s -> 10559.44s]  Around the objectives and people will face check them and you can just one tap on the way game
[10561.52s -> 10563.52s]  It's actually incredibly fun
[10566.96s -> 10569.68s]  Like you just put them in the corners of the bushes where people have to walk
[10576.00s -> 10578.00s]  Like right here I can put it right between the turret
[10586.32s -> 10594.00s]  I don't know why I didn't ghost I'll be honest. I have no idea why I didn't ghost
[10597.12s -> 10599.36s]  I was like saving it for something. I'm not sure what
[10602.56s -> 10605.04s]  Next year a birthday present who the fuck knows
[10609.20s -> 10611.20s]  Oh, I could have one shot that guy if I was better at Cait
[10611.84s -> 10613.28s]  I
[10613.28s -> 10616.24s]  Did a really classic combo right there. I just didn't queue because I'm bad
[10618.56s -> 10621.68s]  I should have when he hit the trap your two headshots sit on him for a few seconds
[10621.68s -> 10625.04s]  So what I should have done is I should have instantly queued on top of the trap then auto auto
[10625.04s -> 10626.32s]  And he would have died
[10626.32s -> 10631.28s]  Because your queue does the max damage when they're trapped too. So it would have been like just a perfect three shot
[10632.00s -> 10636.24s]  But like I said, I don't play kate enough and my muscle memories kind of trash sometimes so
[10637.76s -> 10639.76s]  That was my bad
[10642.16s -> 10644.16s]  Oh
[10650.00s -> 10653.28s]  We're getting cluttered I don't know where he is but
[10653.28s -> 10655.28s]  I
[10671.28s -> 10673.28s]  Shouldn't have done that
[10674.80s -> 10678.80s]  I'm limit testing really hard right now. I suggest you guys don't limit test
[10678.80s -> 10680.56s]  Well, actually, I do think you should limit test
[10680.64s -> 10684.08s]  But not if you want to win like play safer like right there. The play wasn't to go back in
[10684.64s -> 10687.28s]  The play was to like back off, but I wanted to see if I could like
[10690.32s -> 10692.32s]  I wanted to see if I was terrible or not
[10693.60s -> 10695.12s]  You know
[10695.12s -> 10697.12s]  I was
[10697.52s -> 10700.08s]  But yeah, I mean the combo with kate is like if they're trapped
[10700.64s -> 10703.84s]  You want to queue while they're in the trap essentially because
[10705.20s -> 10708.80s]  Your auto will always give you the range. So if you auto and then queue
[10709.20s -> 10711.20s]  Um
[10711.44s -> 10714.32s]  When when they're trapped they get uh not a lot of people know this
[10714.88s -> 10719.44s]  Because I just found this out like a few years or like after I should have uh
[10720.88s -> 10722.88s]  When you queue on top of a k trap
[10723.04s -> 10729.28s]  The way kate's queue works is when you queue the initial like it hits initially and then it does less damage to the targets behind it, right
[10730.48s -> 10732.80s]  It's very narrow and then it likes it like gets bigger. So
[10733.84s -> 10735.60s]  when they're trapped though
[10735.60s -> 10739.36s]  It does the maximum queue damage that it can do in like the isolation of the queue
[10739.84s -> 10742.72s]  So that's why when people are trapped you want to open up with your queue
[10745.28s -> 10748.80s]  You either want to net into the queue and then double auto
[10749.36s -> 10752.08s]  Or you want to net or you want to like you want to queue
[10752.96s -> 10755.76s]  Then trap net at the same time then double auto
[10756.24s -> 10761.36s]  You basically it's a very interesting way to play you always want to try and overlay a trap on your trap
[10761.92s -> 10767.36s]  So when they get trapped you can overlay a second trap to either in front of them or behind them
[10767.68s -> 10771.52s]  And what'll happen is there's actually like a little mini like I want to say one second
[10772.32s -> 10775.52s]  Cool down of being able to be trapped right like a little 1.5 two second cooldown
[10776.16s -> 10779.76s]  But what can happen is they sit in the trap then what you can do is your net can slow them
[10780.16s -> 10782.56s]  So you can you can actually queue in the first trap
[10782.88s -> 10789.04s]  Then you can drop a second trap net slow them into the second trap and then triple auto headshot them from all three of the
[10789.04s -> 10791.04s]  net the two traps
[10791.12s -> 10793.12s]  It's really complicated sounding
[10796.88s -> 10798.88s]  But
[10802.88s -> 10806.32s]  This man does redeemed end my stream whenever you want
[10813.52s -> 10815.52s]  What
[10817.12s -> 10819.12s]  Why
[10822.00s -> 10824.00s]  Why would you want to end my stream right now
[10829.52s -> 10831.52s]  Why would you want to be that guy?
[10838.16s -> 10840.16s]  Wow, okay
[10840.16s -> 10842.16s]  You
[10850.16s -> 10856.88s]  Don't shit don't end just change the camera position did you just spend 1 million points
[10859.52s -> 10863.44s]  To tell me to put the camera back on the right side of my fucking
[10864.32s -> 10866.32s]  Hey
[10869.20s -> 10873.76s]  No way no way you just did that
[10877.92s -> 10883.28s]  I was like this man is just flexing he's just like yeah, I got some points to spare
[10883.68s -> 10885.68s]  I guess I could like throw him, you know
[10889.52s -> 10891.52s]  All right fine
[10894.24s -> 10896.24s]  You
[10901.76s -> 10904.40s]  There's that better is that better
[10910.16s -> 10913.28s]  Drink water actually that's a good one. I'll be our be I'm gonna get some water
[10916.08s -> 10919.12s]  Should we plan our main I kind of want to try and hit GM
[10920.08s -> 10923.12s]  Yeah, let's get on our main account. It's like 1 p.m. So it's like 3 p.m. Eastern
[10924.08s -> 10925.68s]  I think
[10925.68s -> 10927.68s]  I can get cues at the moments
[10930.00s -> 10934.40s]  Let me get some water and then we'll queue up or we'll queue up then get some water real quick
[10942.96s -> 10946.48s]  Because I think I think it's late enough than day I can get cues now without waiting 40 minutes
[10946.80s -> 10957.36s]  By the way, it is it is a teaching stream when I'm doing that like ad carry academy thing
[10957.36s -> 10960.48s]  So if you guys have any questions you want to ask or like you guys can ignore that
[10961.04s -> 10963.04s]  If you guys have any questions you want to ask or anything like that
[10963.92s -> 10966.40s]  You know if we're just chilling between games just ask whatever you want
[10966.40s -> 10970.48s]  I I can answer a lot easier between games that I can't in game
[10971.52s -> 10973.12s]  You know, it's a lot easier for me to see that shit
[10973.12s -> 10975.76s]  I try and answer in game, but like sometimes I'm like focusing and shit
[10976.48s -> 10978.48s]  So it's a little harder
[10984.96s -> 10988.00s]  I'm gonna get some water though. So I'll be right back. Okay
[10989.36s -> 10991.36s]  Talk amongst yourselves
[10991.68s -> 10993.68s]  Is kraken troll on kate?
[10993.68s -> 10995.68s]  No kraken's good on kate
[10995.92s -> 11001.68s]  You can go kraken into bloodthirster or kraken into ie if you really need it if um if they have like tanks
[11001.68s -> 11003.68s]  So they have like scion
[11003.84s -> 11006.88s]  So 20 stuff like that that you have to like you're the only damage
[11006.96s -> 11011.92s]  Let's say you're like the only tank killer on the team. You're like the only 80 damage you have to go kraken sometimes
[11033.68s -> 11035.68s]  You
[11063.68s -> 11065.68s]  You
[11093.68s -> 11095.68s]  You
[11123.68s -> 11125.68s]  You
[11153.68s -> 11155.68s]  You
[11184.64s -> 11186.64s]  You
[11189.52s -> 11191.52s]  Oh, I just sat down sweet
[11197.44s -> 11199.44s]  Swears I
[11200.00s -> 11202.00s]  Like just sat back down. I was like, oh, yeah
[11203.60s -> 11207.04s]  Let's go kupoff. Oh somebody declined it. Fuck
[11208.64s -> 11210.64s]  All right boys, let's go
[11213.76s -> 11222.80s]  I got I got so many things in front of me right now. I got water. I got fucking rice cake
[11236.24s -> 11240.40s]  You also have with my hair today, what the fuck there we go
[11243.68s -> 11253.36s]  All right boys, what are we playing?
[11265.12s -> 11268.24s]  I don't really care about banning you me most of the time, but we'll just do it
[11274.64s -> 11281.36s]  I don't remember what we're talking about. Oh supports. Yeah, they're all stupid
[11285.60s -> 11288.72s]  Sky, oh, that's so good. That's so good
[11288.72s -> 11302.88s]  All right, what am I playing or is Varys
[11303.60s -> 11320.48s]  You just play jinx milio jinx milio pretty pretty gross land pretty gross land
[11329.36s -> 11331.36s]  Um
[11331.60s -> 11334.48s]  Kaisa, I didn't want to pick kaisa into Varys
[11335.44s -> 11339.84s]  I could have picked kaisa this game, but I kind of wanted to pick jinx because milio jinx is really good
[11340.48s -> 11342.48s]  It's like a super super op land
[11347.52s -> 11349.76s]  Somebody dodged okay, take us out
[11354.48s -> 11357.36s]  All right, I'm back. What's up?
[11358.32s -> 11362.16s]  I don't remember what we're talking about. Oh supports. Yeah, they're all stupid
[11366.40s -> 11372.64s]  I mean listen every 80 carries default state of mind listen. I'm not wrong
[11382.72s -> 11384.72s]  I ain't wrong
[11385.28s -> 11388.72s]  I need to see if this guy is the pike player or not
[11390.24s -> 11394.40s]  Before I ban this because like I don't want to play versus pike usually pikes are all like one tricks and shit
[11394.72s -> 11396.72s]  I don't want to play versus a pike player
[11397.28s -> 11400.00s]  But I needed to know that my support wasn't the pike player, you know
[11403.36s -> 11405.36s]  He doesn't seem to care
[11407.68s -> 11410.56s]  Ash milio is really good too. Yeah, no ash milio is really good
[11415.28s -> 11417.28s]  I
[11420.16s -> 11422.16s]  Sub tragedy
[11430.56s -> 11434.72s]  Dude I always have to first pick every game every game I have to first pick every single one
[11445.68s -> 11451.60s]  You're not liking the camera over there. Oh
[11455.84s -> 11457.84s]  My bad
[11474.80s -> 11476.80s]  Can we revert it with points
[11479.04s -> 11484.08s]  Are you motherfuckers trying to like bid war the to where my camera is right now
[11489.28s -> 11491.28s]  Is that what's happening
[11501.68s -> 11503.68s]  Hmm
[11504.80s -> 11506.80s]  You know what's interesting
[11510.32s -> 11512.32s]  I don't know what some I want to take here
[11514.24s -> 11516.32s]  I almost want to take cleanse because they have
[11519.04s -> 11521.04s]  They have a felios queue
[11521.76s -> 11523.44s]  Lulu cc
[11523.44s -> 11526.64s]  Hecarim fear and ariel. I mean Ari charm
[11527.52s -> 11530.32s]  But every single one of those is avoidable if I'm not bad
[11530.64s -> 11539.12s]  It's hard to tell because like every single one of those things is like avoidable if I'm not trash at the game
[11542.00s -> 11544.00s]  So it's like you would be just be taking cleanse for like
[11549.12s -> 11553.68s]  But you do take away a lot of their ability to kill you if you take cleanse
[11553.84s -> 11555.84s]  I
[11567.04s -> 11569.44s]  I'm gonna greed I might regret this though
[11570.48s -> 11572.48s]  Like my gut is telling me to take cleanse
[11573.52s -> 11576.80s]  Because if I take cleanser they only have one way to kill me
[11583.84s -> 11585.84s]  Oh
[11587.68s -> 11592.96s]  Look guys, it's 20. Yo, it's all stylish. I think no, this is the fake stylish
[11595.04s -> 11597.04s]  Wait isn't 21 stylish the fake stylish
[11600.00s -> 11604.16s]  Is that the real one or the fake one there's like a fake one out there and I don't know if that's the real one or the fake one
[11608.56s -> 11610.56s]  Oh, it's stylish nice
[11611.52s -> 11613.52s]  What reverse again
[11617.52s -> 11619.52s]  I'll take long long three
[11641.20s -> 11646.72s]  We'll take long three this game just because I'm
[11654.48s -> 11656.48s]  Warm up a bit
[11658.64s -> 11663.12s]  I actually like long three more against double range because you can't get poked out
[11671.52s -> 11674.40s]  Why don't you like ghost over hill I do like ghost
[11675.28s -> 11676.72s]  um
[11676.72s -> 11679.36s]  This game particularly I don't think ghost has more value though
[11680.88s -> 11682.56s]  because
[11682.56s -> 11685.76s]  The only like ghost is really good against like triple melee
[11688.56s -> 11691.84s]  Like I like ghost a lot against like triple melee jumps or comps
[11692.72s -> 11696.24s]  But there's only two melees and one of them. I don't even consider heck or my melee
[11697.92s -> 11699.92s]  That comes like a fucking
[11700.56s -> 11702.56s]  You motherfucker
[11704.96s -> 11706.96s]  Heck I'm something an assassin song
[11722.08s -> 11726.08s]  You know what's interesting this Lulu is bullying the fuck out of us
[11726.32s -> 11729.84s]  I'm trying to get level two
[11736.88s -> 11743.04s]  So I think Lulu has we could we could just double either guy
[11747.04s -> 11749.04s]  Why would you do that
[11756.88s -> 11760.48s]  I'm confused as to like what's happening here
[11766.72s -> 11768.72s]  Why aren't we fighting these guys
[11770.48s -> 11772.48s]  This this senator this this
[11772.88s -> 11774.56s]  Seraphine's trolling
[11774.56s -> 11776.56s]  So all she had to do there was double e
[11777.04s -> 11782.00s]  That's it. If she double e'd either of them. They instantly die because we have heal. They don't have heal and we have exhaust
[11782.72s -> 11789.60s]  They've they've they have ghosts so all you have to do to win that is double e walk up exhaust the aphelios and we win like he dies
[11793.04s -> 11797.36s]  I'm impressed that this guy's I I don't want to be mean nevermind
[11799.36s -> 11801.36s]  I there's no reason to be mean
[11802.08s -> 11805.04s]  Maybe he just doesn't uh play seraphine that much
[11807.52s -> 11810.16s]  I mean, yeah, he like the seraphine should be walking up right now
[11810.16s -> 11812.16s]  You see how like far back she is
[11812.64s -> 11814.96s]  I can't walk up like at the moments. I just can't
[11825.68s -> 11827.68s]  Oh, that was good fucking juke
[11829.52s -> 11831.52s]  I really want to push this
[11834.40s -> 11836.56s]  Oh my stylish in god
[11840.56s -> 11842.56s]  Is kind of a god
[11846.72s -> 11852.64s]  Yeah, what the fuck that was insane. I mean it's fucking smurfing
[11856.24s -> 11859.04s]  Jesus like that was dirty
[11862.72s -> 11864.72s]  Guys nuts
[11870.16s -> 11872.16s]  I
[11888.40s -> 11892.88s]  Didn't put any points in my e because when we were in the lane I didn't have enough uh
[11893.12s -> 11895.12s]  I
[11896.72s -> 11901.68s]  Didn't have enough man. Let me use e anyway, so there was no real point to put it in there at the time
[11902.24s -> 11904.24s]  I kind of wish I had e now, but
[11918.32s -> 11920.32s]  Oh, that was a misposition Jesus
[11923.12s -> 11927.20s]  I'm just off today. I don't know why I don't need to push this. I can just let it sit
[11928.56s -> 11932.24s]  I thinned it a tiny bit now what we can do here is we just let it sit there
[11933.04s -> 11935.04s]  The phallios can't walk up
[11937.04s -> 11941.76s]  Now I would want the seraphine to be like in the bush over there like like up a bit right
[11942.40s -> 11946.72s]  Because if she stands in that bush a phallios can't walk up whereas if she's behind me
[11947.44s -> 11949.76s]  A phallios can walk up stand in that bush and soak xp
[11950.48s -> 11953.44s]  So stopping the xp soak is very important
[11956.72s -> 11961.20s]  I need to run to this fight. I think the fight's over already. I think my team trolled, but I'm still gonna run to it
[11976.72s -> 11978.72s]  Not bad
[11980.24s -> 11982.24s]  Nice
[11982.80s -> 11984.80s]  So i'm very low right now
[11985.20s -> 11989.68s]  Um, I think the only thing to do is actually just the back so the way the wave is set up right now
[11990.96s -> 11992.96s]  I can't push it before they get back to lane
[11993.44s -> 11995.68s]  It will like slow push towards them
[11996.72s -> 11998.72s]  But I don't think I have a choice
[12000.00s -> 12002.80s]  I'd have to this is something that i'm actually I'd have to actually rewatch
[12003.92s -> 12005.92s]  I no I think it's actually frozen
[12006.64s -> 12009.12s]  But I think maybe I should have cleared one minion maybe two
[12010.16s -> 12012.32s]  So that it doesn't like crash and it stays frozen
[12015.20s -> 12017.20s]  Unless I did it correctly
[12017.76s -> 12022.40s]  Maybe i'm overthinking it. All right, I think I did it right. Yeah, I did. Okay, nevermind
[12023.20s -> 12025.20s]  I thought I was like overthinking it
[12025.20s -> 12027.20s]  I
[12039.28s -> 12041.92s]  What I think about ghost instead of heal on jinx, I think it's great
[12042.96s -> 12046.40s]  Like I said, um, this game specifically, I think heal has more value
[12046.80s -> 12049.60s]  But I think in a lot of games ghost is very good
[12051.20s -> 12053.52s]  Ghost is good on ash good on jinx good on afelios
[12054.16s -> 12058.08s]  Zary like ad carries at the moment the ghost meta is really good because they're like
[12058.48s -> 12064.72s]  There's a really heavy like tank bruiser meta going on right coupled with like an enchantery meta or like a
[12065.20s -> 12067.20s]  bot lane where it's like a bunch of melees
[12067.52s -> 12070.40s]  I suck Jesus and because of that. I think it's actually
[12072.24s -> 12076.72s]  Ghost is super good. I just this game. There's only two melees in the enemy team and um
[12080.24s -> 12083.20s]  I didn't want to just farm lane this I wanted to be able to fight early
[12083.92s -> 12088.80s]  Well, okay, so the reason you take ghosts is because you farm lane
[12090.48s -> 12093.68s]  You're not looking to fight early when you take ghost. That's the whole point of ghost
[12094.08s -> 12096.08s]  It's a scaling. It's a hundred percent a scaling
[12096.64s -> 12099.52s]  Summoner, so if you're playing in lower elo, um
[12100.40s -> 12103.04s]  And you you know you want to take ghost or you want to try it out
[12103.52s -> 12106.00s]  Just realize that like you are trying to scale
[12107.68s -> 12109.68s]  Oh somebody afk'd
[12110.56s -> 12112.56s]  Okay, that's cringe
[12113.92s -> 12121.36s]  Like if you're in say you're in like gold silver plat whatever elo you're in
[12121.84s -> 12124.32s]  That's like you deemed as like, you know a bit of the lower elos
[12124.64s -> 12127.12s]  I don't even pick plots that low but a golden silver, right?
[12127.92s -> 12132.16s]  Um because gold is average so it's like not even low typically, but everybody says it's low
[12132.72s -> 12134.72s]  Uh
[12135.12s -> 12140.64s]  If you if you take ghost just understand that you are playing for mid game bronze still you're playing for mid game
[12140.64s -> 12145.36s]  Yeah ghost is fun. I I would take personally. I would probably take heal in bronze
[12146.00s -> 12150.24s]  Uh just because I think you can take advantage of lane phase really hard in bronze
[12153.36s -> 12155.36s]  Like bronze elo to me is like
[12156.08s -> 12159.28s]  I should have reported that guy. I'm stupid bronze elo to me is like
[12160.16s -> 12161.44s]  uh, you can
[12161.44s -> 12167.12s]  Learn how to abuse people's lane phase really hard because people will fight a lot in bronze, right?
[12167.12s -> 12172.32s]  Like they will take bad trades or they will like try and fight because they don't know typically if you're bronze
[12172.32s -> 12176.40s]  You probably don't know like the champions very well and the damage stuff and stuff like that
[12176.88s -> 12181.36s]  So what ends up happening is like you probably just die a bunch or there are probably a lot of deaths in bronze
[12182.00s -> 12184.00s]  so
[12184.72s -> 12186.72s]  I would say
[12186.88s -> 12192.48s]  Playing to like be able to help yourself early game with all the fighting going on is going to have a lot more value than ghost
[12193.20s -> 12200.48s]  Ghost is more of like a we hit mid game or a giant fight broke out and I can like it's an extended long fight
[12200.48s -> 12202.48s]  And I can get ghost utilization
[12202.64s -> 12205.44s]  Also ghost is really valuable when you have good mechanical skill
[12206.08s -> 12208.48s]  Like ghost requires very good positioning typically
[12209.20s -> 12214.56s]  Because you're repositioning a lot in the fight and that's why ghost is so good because you can reposition back for back for back forward
[12215.04s -> 12217.04s]  and you can essentially like
[12217.20s -> 12219.20s]  space the enemy and
[12219.20s -> 12221.20s]  Get free damage
[12223.36s -> 12225.84s]  Free boots too depends on the champion and the matchup
[12226.88s -> 12227.76s]  like
[12227.76s -> 12230.16s]  If I'm playing jinx and I'm playing into like
[12231.20s -> 12232.24s]  I don't know
[12232.24s -> 12234.32s]  Let's say I'm playing into like heisellulu. Okay
[12234.88s -> 12236.08s]  You can take free boots
[12236.08s -> 12239.36s]  You don't need early boots in that matchup because it's an enchanter farm
[12239.68s -> 12242.16s]  80 carry versus an enchanter farm 80 carry. Okay
[12242.88s -> 12247.12s]  Now if I'm versus let's say I'm versus like a blitzcrank. Let's say I'm playing jinx and I'm versus blitz
[12247.84s -> 12252.16s]  Like I typically don't want to have to wait till nine minutes to get boots because blitzcrank is gonna shit on me
[12252.96s -> 12257.44s]  So I will take different runes versus that blitzcrank to allow myself
[12258.64s -> 12262.96s]  The option of like let's say I have 1100 gold and I back I can get early boots and now
[12264.00s -> 12266.24s]  The blitzcrank has a much harder time
[12270.88s -> 12275.12s]  Dude I almost want to ban zed because I don't want to get shit on by stylish, but I think it's cringe
[12276.56s -> 12278.56s]  I don't want to like ban stylish outs
[12282.48s -> 12284.48s]  I
[12295.12s -> 12299.20s]  Often is 80 carry bot. Do you play parallel to your support? You try to always
[12301.60s -> 12304.88s]  Essentially the perfect way to play bot win is you're both hitting one target
[12306.00s -> 12309.44s]  At the same time trading on one target at the same time you're making like a little triangle
[12310.32s -> 12313.44s]  And you're both just like standing next to each other and you're both hitting that one target, right?
[12315.60s -> 12318.88s]  That's the best way to play bot lane, but it's very hard in solo queue obviously to do that
[12321.52s -> 12323.52s]  But if you have like a duo you can practice it
[12324.40s -> 12326.80s]  Sorry it went down the wrong pipe 80 carry tier of us
[12327.92s -> 12329.76s]  I should make one
[12329.76s -> 12331.52s]  I have this thing where
[12331.52s -> 12333.52s]  Even though i'm like grandmaster level
[12335.44s -> 12337.44s]  I still think I suck
[12337.44s -> 12341.60s]  I have this like running lack of confidence because I used to be challenger and now I'm like hard stuck gm
[12342.24s -> 12344.48s]  So like I have this lack of confidence in what i'm talking about
[12345.92s -> 12350.16s]  So like I feel like if I were to make a tier list it would be based on like a gm players
[12350.72s -> 12351.68s]  skill
[12351.68s -> 12354.64s]  And I I don't know if like I don't want to get ripped apart by people
[12356.88s -> 12359.36s]  But I guess I could make a tier list from my own opinion
[12367.44s -> 12369.44s]  So
[12376.00s -> 12381.44s]  Like let me see tier list maker i'm sure there's a tier list maker with champions, right?
[12398.32s -> 12400.32s]  You
[12412.56s -> 12416.48s]  Yeah, there it is wait this is terrible what is what are these pictures?
[12422.96s -> 12425.60s]  I'm just what what is this what is this?
[12426.56s -> 12428.56s]  Why is niko on here?
[12439.52s -> 12442.02s]  I want to use this one, but this one doesn't have zerry
[12446.16s -> 12450.24s]  I'm trying to find one with zerry on it that doesn't look like shit it says this one has zerry
[12451.04s -> 12453.70s]  But it looks like it looks shitty. I don't I don't enjoy that
[12455.60s -> 12457.60s]  I
[12465.52s -> 12467.68s]  Hold on we're gonna play ash this game because they picked xerath
[12468.64s -> 12471.60s]  Like I just saw him first pick xerath, so I want something that can engage on the xerath
[12473.44s -> 12477.36s]  So we're gonna go ash these are gonna be my ash runes this game boys. Um
[12481.36s -> 12483.36s]  So I want to go presence of minds
[12486.00s -> 12488.00s]  I don't know
[12490.00s -> 12496.00s]  I kind of do but I kind of don't I think presence of mind kind of sucks it feels kind of shitty
[12500.64s -> 12504.32s]  Hmm we can just do overkill we can go lakrity
[12507.12s -> 12510.24s]  I probably won't go kraken sir this game so we could probably just go lakrity
[12510.96s -> 12515.12s]  Even though kraken sir is not baton ash. I kind of want to go board crush
[12522.08s -> 12524.08s]  But I could go
[12528.00s -> 12531.84s]  I actually don't know what I want to take if I want to take borderline or lakrity. I'm gonna take lakrity. We'll try it out
[12533.28s -> 12535.28s]  And then we'll do ghost. Okay. Um
[12536.16s -> 12538.16s]  What's he gonna say?
[12538.64s -> 12541.28s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, I need to find the right tier list
[12545.92s -> 12550.08s]  I mean I can just use this right I can't where's zerry
[12557.36s -> 12559.36s]  Oh, oh there we go
[12560.88s -> 12564.56s]  Yeah, this is good. Okay. I was like I was trying to figure it out. I was like what the fuck
[12565.44s -> 12570.16s]  Uh, I think just straight out of the gate. I was putting jinx and s tier
[12571.52s -> 12574.72s]  I think jinx is just an s tier champion. She's crazy op
[12576.72s -> 12580.00s]  Like jinx just does whatever champion wants to do but like better than them
[12580.56s -> 12582.16s]  She's blind pickable
[12582.16s -> 12584.16s]  Her two item three item spike is crazy
[12585.28s -> 12589.20s]  She's doesn't have a lot of like really bad matchups and lane phase anymore
[12590.00s -> 12593.04s]  They gave her scaling like crazy high like she's just good
[12594.56s -> 12597.12s]  Good build paths, etc. Like it's just a good champion
[12599.84s -> 12604.96s]  Uh, I would say it's also hard to do tier lists because you have to do tier lists for like low elo and high elo
[12605.28s -> 12608.24s]  Right because if I'm doing like a low elo tier lists
[12609.04s -> 12611.04s]  You're putting mf like here
[12611.84s -> 12615.68s]  Right like mf super good. If you're doing a high elo tier list mfs like here
[12617.44s -> 12619.44s]  It's it's hard to explain
[12619.92s -> 12621.92s]  And like in low elo i'm putting calista here
[12622.64s -> 12624.64s]  But in high elo i'm putting her here
[12625.76s -> 12627.76s]  So it's it's really interesting
[12631.44s -> 12634.08s]  Right because it's all based on like people's mechanical skill too
[12635.04s -> 12637.20s]  But yeah, we did a tier list between games I guess
[12638.48s -> 12643.20s]  So far I think jinx is definitely s tier. I wish there was like an s plus tier
[12645.44s -> 12647.44s]  But jinx is definitely s tier
[12647.68s -> 12649.68s]  Draven's hard to choose for me
[12649.68s -> 12653.92s]  Like I want to put him in a tier because he has a lot of counter matchups, but in solo queue
[12654.48s -> 12656.48s]  Draven feels insane
[12658.72s -> 12662.72s]  So it's hard because I I don't think draven I think draven's overrated personally
[12663.52s -> 12665.52s]  Because I know how to beat draven players
[12665.92s -> 12667.92s]  But I also think in high elo
[12669.28s -> 12672.08s]  When people also know how to deal with draven players the game
[12673.04s -> 12677.04s]  I also do feel like uh
[12678.72s -> 12682.48s]  Good draven players and good people who know how to play around draven players make draven op
[12682.96s -> 12686.40s]  Uh, but it's also the the opposite where good players who know how to play around draven
[12686.80s -> 12689.44s]  Can counter pick draven and make him worthless. So it's it's really
[12690.80s -> 12692.80s]  It's really hard
[12702.32s -> 12710.48s]  All right, let me say morgana versus
[12714.72s -> 12716.72s]  Moo moo
[12717.92s -> 12721.36s]  Jin players, jin players are psychopaths man. I
[12723.12s -> 12726.80s]  I don't think jin's very good right now. I think he could be good if they gave him like a quality life change
[12727.20s -> 12729.20s]  Isn't he getting buff next patch?
[12729.36s -> 12731.36s]  I
[12731.84s -> 12733.84s]  Think he's getting buffed
[12735.20s -> 12739.36s]  I think he should do I jin's such a fun champ. He's just like a little shitty
[12749.68s -> 12752.48s]  We can actually just straight fight them right now if i'm a moo moo just queues
[12755.92s -> 12757.92s]  Because uh morgana is worthless level one
[12759.36s -> 12761.36s]  I
[12764.48s -> 12766.48s]  Actually just straight up want to fight these guys right now
[12768.48s -> 12770.48s]  Go go go
[12780.72s -> 12782.72s]  I hope he missed both his queues
[12783.36s -> 12786.08s]  Dude this this a moo moo's killing me man
[12787.04s -> 12793.12s]  Oh my god, I uh bro, what am I watching?
[12795.36s -> 12797.36s]  What are the what are these queues brother?
[12800.00s -> 12802.00s]  Fuck
[12803.20s -> 12807.36s]  Holy shit, all right, I should have taken a long sword
[12811.68s -> 12814.40s]  A moo moo is not feeling himself today. Let me tell you what
[12817.04s -> 12819.04s]  He is not feeling himself
[12834.80s -> 12838.96s]  Chase even if there's comms chase. Okay, we run
[12839.36s -> 12841.36s]  Uh
[12846.00s -> 12850.40s]  I don't know if we can fight this we can try I'll follow you
[12864.24s -> 12866.24s]  Well, I mean that guy should die
[12869.92s -> 12876.32s]  Dude what I don't even know what's happening right now. This is this is crazy
[12880.08s -> 12884.48s]  This is this is ridiculous both mid laners just got like three kills out of nowhere
[12894.48s -> 12896.08s]  We went from like a ridiculously
[12896.08s -> 12900.80s]  We went from like a grandmaster game to like a diamond game like somehow
[12903.84s -> 12906.48s]  Like the moo moo's like kind of whipping some shit
[12907.84s -> 12912.56s]  Uh, I took a bad trade early then fucking this shit is funny as fuck
[12916.00s -> 12918.08s]  So I'm gonna I'm gonna actually rush tier two boots this game
[12919.52s -> 12921.52s]  Because I actually really
[12921.76s -> 12923.76s]  Really really
[12923.92s -> 12925.92s]  Want to be mobile against their team
[12926.16s -> 12931.44s]  Like I'm just gonna straight up leave go buy t2 boots and that's gonna be my my power spike for ash right now
[12933.60s -> 12937.28s]  They have so many things that I can dodge on their team like look at the shit right like
[12937.84s -> 12939.20s]  Morgue binding
[12939.20s -> 12942.24s]  T2 boots super easy to dodge if she can't flash it on me, right?
[12942.24s -> 12947.04s]  Or if she can't flash melee range that Morgue bind it's I should never get hit by unless I have no fingers
[12947.84s -> 12949.84s]  Ezreal cute easy to dodge
[12950.24s -> 12958.08s]  Zerath easy to dodge this guy whatever the fuck, uh, kha'zix bugman. He's a melee champ. So boots have value, etc
[12963.12s -> 12966.88s]  Also the cool thing about boots boots rush ash is she doesn't have damage
[12968.72s -> 12972.32s]  That uh, if I'm good at spacing like the better at spacing you are
[12973.84s -> 12975.84s]  You can actually just 1v2
[12976.56s -> 12978.56s]  Especially against double skill shots like this
[12980.08s -> 12982.08s]  It's pretty fun
[12982.08s -> 12984.08s]  Fuck
[13005.84s -> 13007.84s]  If I juke that last q I would have killed that guy
[13008.64s -> 13014.40s]  Dude Zerath actually fucked us so bad though. That was a good fight until Zerath just showed up and beat our ass
[13026.24s -> 13028.24s]  Yeah, just get the just get the minion wave
[13031.44s -> 13033.84s]  It's kind of funny to watch though because I do so little damage
[13034.40s -> 13038.56s]  But I also like just perma slow so they can't do anything about it
[13041.60s -> 13045.68s]  Hopefully when tf gets six he can come bot and we can fuck over there balling
[13047.44s -> 13049.44s]  I'm hoping that that's the case
[13055.44s -> 13058.96s]  Uh, we're gonna roam to mid kha'zix is also mid tf dead
[13059.92s -> 13061.92s]  That's a good roam
[13067.28s -> 13076.56s]  I'm gonna push this so that maybe we can play for a dragon because they might go for a dragon here and I think we can stop it
[13079.28s -> 13081.28s]  We have tf ults
[13084.88s -> 13086.88s]  Yep
[13088.96s -> 13093.76s]  Just leave we don't need to actually chase or do anything crazy. We're just stopping the dragon. That's all we're doing
[13095.36s -> 13097.36s]  Right, we don't want to give him a free drake
[13102.24s -> 13104.72s]  See the t2 boots are just broken they're broken as shit
[13111.76s -> 13116.56s]  Because you can just see like I can I can pretty much just I'm just too fast for them to deal with
[13119.68s -> 13121.68s]  Like look at this. It's it's insane
[13130.72s -> 13137.52s]  And that's why I value like the tier 2 boots on champions, especially like ash where you can be extra egregious with it
[13138.00s -> 13140.00s]  Because like her slow
[13140.48s -> 13144.40s]  Imagine it's like, you know, it's the same idea as vain right when you think about it. It's like, okay
[13144.56s -> 13148.48s]  So what's really annoying trying to run away from a vein, right?
[13148.96s -> 13153.84s]  She gets boots too and you're like god damn it man. She's so fast same thing with ash. Oh wait now you're slow
[13155.12s -> 13157.36s]  So it's even more annoying you try you try and go in on her
[13157.44s -> 13163.20s]  She just spaces you walks away a bit now you're just sitting there waddling towards her slowly just upset tilted frustrated
[13164.72s -> 13166.72s]  You know, it's like your middle school dance
[13174.80s -> 13176.80s]  You
[13185.12s -> 13187.12s]  You know what
[13189.36s -> 13191.36s]  I think this is actually a shield bow game
[13192.80s -> 13196.56s]  It is I was gonna go bork, but I think this is a shield bow game
[13198.32s -> 13201.12s]  It could be a gale force game too both both are both are viable
[13201.52s -> 13206.80s]  But uh, I actually I might be one of the I might be in the minority here with this
[13207.44s -> 13210.80s]  I think bork rush on ash is actually good sometimes
[13212.24s -> 13216.00s]  Like I think if I was versus some tanks like, you know, like a scion or something like that
[13216.40s -> 13218.40s]  I actually think bork rush and ash is kind of cracked
[13219.76s -> 13224.00s]  Like yeah, it stalls out like you make the argument like it stalls out your three item or your two item
[13224.56s -> 13226.56s]  But it's it feels kind of nuts
[13226.80s -> 13231.44s]  Also, this is a really op thing that you can do. I should have hawk shot it sooner
[13231.92s -> 13236.40s]  I knew that they were doing uh rift, but I'm not paying attention as much as I should be
[13237.44s -> 13239.44s]  so
[13243.84s -> 13249.44s]  Because what you can do is you can uh hawk shot to tell your team where the enemy jungler is and get information yourself
[13253.60s -> 13255.60s]  I mean this more gone is level five
[13257.52s -> 13259.92s]  We could fight just because morgue is five right now
[13261.76s -> 13263.76s]  Uh, I kind of want to try
[13268.56s -> 13272.16s]  Uh-oh my moomoo didn't want to go in my bad
[13275.76s -> 13277.76s]  I'm a little sad. I'm not gonna lie because
[13278.24s -> 13282.16s]  I do feel like we win these fights, but a moomoo wants to wait for six
[13282.96s -> 13285.52s]  Which is fine, but like I said, you guys know me
[13285.60s -> 13288.40s]  I like to actually fight and be active in the lane early
[13289.12s -> 13291.12s]  Because I know that we can fight right
[13292.24s -> 13294.24s]  And so it's like obviously, you know
[13303.52s -> 13307.12s]  Oh, this is really rough I can't do anything
[13307.52s -> 13309.52s]  I
[13309.60s -> 13311.60s]  Because there it's here
[13312.48s -> 13317.36s]  TF's coming with ult though. I don't have ult. God damn it if I'd ult this would be so god tier
[13320.08s -> 13324.80s]  God you have no idea how OP this would be if I'd ulti man whenever I'm bad
[13327.44s -> 13329.76s]  I want to push this wave out. I'm assuming they're all backing
[13331.84s -> 13336.72s]  I think we penta there it with ult we even killed the top laner. Oh, I'm dead. Why did I stay?
[13338.08s -> 13339.60s]  I knew
[13339.60s -> 13340.56s]  Cosyx would do that
[13340.56s -> 13346.08s]  I have to retrain my brain cosyx players are rats and I have to retrain my brain to remember that they will sit in a bush for
[13346.24s -> 13349.12s]  30 minutes lose all of their farm to get one kill
[13350.16s -> 13352.16s]  I like always forget that
[13355.20s -> 13357.52s]  Like cosyx players are absolute fucking rats
[13361.68s -> 13366.48s]  Like I respect Rengar players more than cosyx players. Yeah, I said it. I know hot take
[13366.64s -> 13368.64s]  I know but I do
[13371.84s -> 13373.84s]  I'm gonna try and arrow right here
[13377.28s -> 13379.28s]  Got him
[13380.24s -> 13384.00s]  You know that guy's pissed by the way that damn it
[13390.80s -> 13392.80s]  He's gonna try and ult me from the bush
[13393.60s -> 13397.20s]  You can always tell that you're about to get ulted when an Ezreal big big tip for you guys
[13397.60s -> 13401.36s]  If an Ezreal ever walks out of vision, expect that he's ulting you
[13403.12s -> 13404.72s]  I you would not believe
[13404.72s -> 13409.84s]  You would not believe the amount of people that I kill with Ezreal by simply walking into a bush and ulting them
[13410.32s -> 13412.32s]  And they forget that I exist
[13412.96s -> 13415.36s]  I'm not I'm not even it happens so often
[13416.56s -> 13419.36s]  They're just like, oh, yeah, he went in the bush. He's gonna hit his ult key
[13420.24s -> 13425.92s]  Like I it is comical how often it happens and I'm sure you guys have died to it too
[13427.44s -> 13431.44s]  Because it's like a thing where like you never see you barely you don't see Ezreal that often right
[13431.92s -> 13434.40s]  So because you probably don't see Ezreal too often you're always like
[13436.64s -> 13438.64s]  Oh interesting type shit
[13443.12s -> 13445.68s]  I'm gonna grab this plate and then I'm gonna back up
[13446.40s -> 13450.08s]  Cause it's just coming down here. So I'm gonna back the fuck up
[13451.52s -> 13453.52s]  So I don't have arrow for 20
[13454.08s -> 13456.08s]  Ezreal has triforce. We need to back up a bit
[13459.20s -> 13464.00s]  Mmm, we might have to give dragon I could see giving dragon being okay though. It's not that bad
[13472.64s -> 13474.64s]  Yeah, it's not it's not the worst to give drake here
[13475.92s -> 13477.92s]  I could even back so we don't get dove
[13479.44s -> 13482.32s]  Like if we back now we might lose bot turret, but I can't walk up
[13485.84s -> 13489.28s]  Yeah, that's what I didn't want to have happen see that's
[13492.72s -> 13496.32s]  I'm telling you bad rats absolute rats
[13496.96s -> 13504.32s]  Cause it's players are rats man absolute literal rats
[13513.36s -> 13516.16s]  Oh, that's classy. That's a good dodge
[13516.32s -> 13518.32s]  I
[13523.92s -> 13530.72s]  Can't even walk up bot. Uh, I can wait for the turret, but I can't walk up. I'll just die
[13532.16s -> 13537.20s]  That's another thing you have to just accept like I'm down 40 cs this game because we've just been getting
[13538.00s -> 13540.00s]  We excited and we've also been getting uh
[13542.00s -> 13544.00s]  Like a moomoo is not very good
[13544.96s -> 13549.92s]  I don't I don't have a better way to say it. I don't have like a nice way to say it. He's not having a good game
[13551.36s -> 13553.92s]  And when your support doesn't have a good game, you don't have a good game early
[13554.88s -> 13561.36s]  So the best thing you can do is just try and uh farm up what you can don't die and scale for late
[13563.92s -> 13567.12s]  It's all you can really do as an ad carry when your support sucks
[13568.80s -> 13570.80s]  It feels really bad, but
[13571.76s -> 13573.76s]  Sometimes you just got to accept it, right
[13574.32s -> 13576.32s]  I
[13581.84s -> 13588.24s]  This Ezreal's not bad, but he's not good either. Oh, yeah, this guy's gonna try and hold me. I'm an old kill ran chair
[13592.32s -> 13594.32s]  Nice
[13604.72s -> 13606.72s]  I don't have ult up yet guys
[13607.44s -> 13609.44s]  I don't have ult up yet. I can't ulti
[13610.72s -> 13612.88s]  I have ult now, but we need to bait them in a bit
[13615.76s -> 13620.24s]  I don't even want to use my ult right now to be honest with you like I I really don't
[13622.08s -> 13626.00s]  You know, what's funny that xeris actually pretty good. I've played against him a few times in the past few seasons
[13626.72s -> 13629.60s]  He's actually not bad. He used to be a support main
[13631.04s -> 13633.04s]  Like he played xeris support
[13634.96s -> 13636.96s]  That's why I recognized his name
[13643.44s -> 13648.16s]  We should not go for this refs. I'm on a bad timer for this
[13650.08s -> 13652.58s]  Because I'm really low hp and mana
[13659.20s -> 13662.48s]  Oh, I don't have mana to arrow here guys
[13664.88s -> 13666.88s]  I
[13671.28s -> 13676.32s]  Do not want to arrow that because the the fiora can totally the fiora can do whatever it's called and
[13681.76s -> 13684.48s]  The fiora can uh, what's it whatever it's called, uh
[13685.20s -> 13687.52s]  W it if she's fast enough and I didn't want to get my team killed
[13689.04s -> 13691.04s]  The real issue here is that we're forcing
[13691.60s -> 13693.60s]  Okay, I'll tell you exactly what the real issue is
[13694.96s -> 13697.68s]  We're forcing too many fights for no reason right now
[13698.32s -> 13702.56s]  So like we're all forcing tons of fights at the moment, right? But there's no reason for us to force these fights
[13704.64s -> 13710.00s]  That's that's why my team's getting uh tilted right like for some reason the amumu and the uh
[13710.56s -> 13712.56s]  TF are both just like inting
[13712.64s -> 13715.76s]  And they're both getting frustrated, but we actually win the game if we play it slow
[13717.52s -> 13720.56s]  Like we can we can slow play this game out in scale, but it just takes time
[13724.88s -> 13730.96s]  Because I specifically picked ash so that we could we had an answer for sarah
[13731.92s -> 13734.96s]  Because we have tf and ash right so we have we have a really good answer for him
[13735.68s -> 13737.68s]  the problem is um
[13738.40s -> 13740.40s]  We need to like stop tilting and just like
[13740.80s -> 13745.28s]  Understand that we can deal with him later. He's not like a he's not like an a soul right like a soul
[13745.28s -> 13747.68s]  It's one of those champs that like you can't deal with
[13747.68s -> 13749.68s]  You
[13751.20s -> 13753.60s]  Why did my amumu wait to use ulti?
[13755.04s -> 13757.04s]  What
[13757.04s -> 13759.04s]  He was in range
[13760.16s -> 13762.16s]  I know he was
[13768.40s -> 13769.36s]  Oh
[13769.36s -> 13773.20s]  Nice, okay, we got a kill we need tf to play the game too though
[13773.76s -> 13777.36s]  Our tf is really tilted so he's just sitting bot
[13780.80s -> 13782.80s]  Amumu is extra tilted too, but I mean
[13783.60s -> 13786.72s]  I'll be I'll be honest the amumu is playing worse than tf. It's just that he's
[13787.44s -> 13789.44s]  Dude, I hate when stuff happens like this
[13789.68s -> 13794.48s]  Stop stop pinging the guy man. He's already frustrated. You pinging him is not going to make him less frustrated
[13795.60s -> 13797.60s]  You're just gonna piss him off more
[13798.72s -> 13800.72s]  Like just play dude
[13801.68s -> 13808.16s]  We have a really good team comp like we're behind right now, but we have a good team comp
[13814.48s -> 13816.48s]  We should give this dragon by the way
[13818.00s -> 13820.00s]  Like a thousand percent we don't have tf ults
[13821.12s -> 13824.96s]  Like maybe maybe we could fight this but the morgues here so she can special my arrow
[13825.36s -> 13827.36s]  They got rift like we should give the drink
[13827.60s -> 13832.32s]  We also have no vision control of this area
[13833.44s -> 13838.16s]  Uh, so this is another thing of like why you guys wonder like why I play uh support in this hero
[13838.88s -> 13842.40s]  Like I get asked a lot like why are you a support man now? I'm still an 80 man, but
[13842.96s -> 13846.48s]  The thing is it's really hard uh to play the game when your supports
[13847.28s -> 13849.28s]  Don't ward correctly
[13850.16s -> 13854.16s]  We can give this guys we can give it's not a huge deal and ours top we don't have to fight this
[13855.28s -> 13857.28s]  Guys we don't have to fight this
[13857.36s -> 13859.52s]  It's back up. Yeah, like this isn't a fight
[13864.48s -> 13868.80s]  It's only second dragon it's nothing wow I suck at CSM
[13879.92s -> 13883.92s]  But you see how little vision control we have on the map right now we have one ward here and that's about it
[13884.88s -> 13888.32s]  The vision control is I say it's 90% of the game in solo queue
[13888.96s -> 13894.64s]  That's why like I feel like supports are like the unsung hero like when you get a support who knows how to properly throw out vision control
[13895.04s -> 13897.04s]  It feels insane
[13902.48s -> 13904.48s]  We just got a push
[13904.88s -> 13908.08s]  I do have hawk shot and in a second we can see if they're on this
[13909.52s -> 13911.52s]  Okay, they're not
[13912.16s -> 13914.16s]  I can voli we can back up
[13916.40s -> 13918.40s]  Kozak's is above me right now
[13923.28s -> 13925.28s]  Okay, Kozak's wasted his ults that's not bad
[13927.04s -> 13928.72s]  We should back
[13928.72s -> 13931.68s]  I don't want to take this fight tf could ulti, but he's not
[13932.72s -> 13934.40s]  right
[13934.40s -> 13938.40s]  Like this this is one of those moments where like I actually think we actually could have killed two of them right there
[13938.96s -> 13940.96s]  if tf ulted
[13941.12s -> 13943.12s]  Because they were out of position really hard
[13945.60s -> 13947.60s]  But again, it's not like
[13948.88s -> 13951.68s]  I think they're gonna walk I think Kozak's is
[13953.28s -> 13955.28s]  Yeah, he's he's somewhere up here. I don't know where he is
[13956.24s -> 13960.00s]  And I can't I can't hawk shot. I wasted my hawk shot for this dragon or this baron
[13962.32s -> 13964.32s]  They could be on baron
[13964.64s -> 13966.64s]  We need to check but I have no hawk shots
[13967.04s -> 13970.64s]  Okay, they're not they're not we're chilling good. Good. I need a hundred golds
[13970.96s -> 13972.96s]  I
[13984.00s -> 13987.04s]  Yeah, I'm aware I'm getting ganked I'm I'm fully fucking aware trust me
[14001.92s -> 14006.56s]  I'm just trying to force them to make a choice probably wasn't a great use of my ghost, but
[14017.84s -> 14019.84s]  I say we bail I need to go get my item
[14021.92s -> 14024.88s]  Ezreal's just pushing aside somehow uncontested over there
[14031.92s -> 14034.56s]  Somebody just TP bought what?
[14038.00s -> 14044.48s]  What the fuck is this a moomoo doing what is my team doing? What are you guys doing? This is so awkward, man
[14053.44s -> 14059.36s]  I mean guys guys kill kill the Kozaks. Oh, thank god
[14060.96s -> 14064.64s]  I don't know why kozaks just dove to kill me of all people
[14066.08s -> 14069.68s]  My man just like wanted me dead. He was like, yeah, fuck that 80 carry guy
[14070.88s -> 14072.88s]  Like, okay
[14073.28s -> 14075.28s]  Sure
[14075.60s -> 14077.60s]  Fuck me
[14078.32s -> 14080.32s]  What do I want
[14081.04s -> 14084.08s]  I feel like I need damage, but I don't know what gives me the highest damage here
[14085.20s -> 14087.20s]  Maybe just
[14091.84s -> 14093.84s]  Or no, maybe just pd
[14094.56s -> 14096.56s]  I'm not actually sure
[14098.16s -> 14103.76s]  I you would be good, but it doesn't give me like more it gives me like I is interesting in this position
[14105.76s -> 14108.08s]  Like I almost want more movement speed from the like pd
[14109.28s -> 14113.76s]  Even though normally like the utility is better like maybe bt is still the best and i'm just trolling
[14114.00s -> 14116.00s]  We
[14120.32s -> 14122.32s]  Can just do dragon right now
[14122.72s -> 14126.08s]  They have no TP here baron. I think we totally actually could do this
[14127.36s -> 14129.36s]  I'm down to try if you if you want to rain gar
[14131.28s -> 14134.32s]  They got two people bought they're setting up for dragon vision right now
[14134.96s -> 14137.92s]  I'm actually kind of down to just try and play for baron here
[14143.76s -> 14149.12s]  Like we could bait baron here and force them to walk into us with my arrow
[14173.92s -> 14179.84s]  I want to stay together because I don't know where the cossacks is
[14182.72s -> 14184.72s]  Found him
[14194.32s -> 14198.88s]  What is my mumu doing dude he has smite like I pull it out if you're gonna do this right like
[14200.08s -> 14202.08s]  I'll use your brain man
[14203.92s -> 14205.92s]  So
[14217.36s -> 14220.48s]  All right now we do baron though we have to we have to do baron
[14224.48s -> 14228.80s]  This is like one of the worst players i've ever seen this a moment. He has no clue what he's doing by the way
[14230.16s -> 14232.16s]  Like he's so dumb
[14233.92s -> 14238.96s]  He's he's like flaming the tf he's in his mind
[14238.96s -> 14242.48s]  He's so angry at this tf that he's ignoring every single thing that's going on
[14243.36s -> 14246.16s]  Like he's ignoring that like the dragon was a bad call to begin with
[14247.68s -> 14251.84s]  And if we are going to do that dragon we have to zone the fucking jungler because he has fucking
[14253.28s -> 14255.28s]  Smite right so it's like
[14256.48s -> 14258.48s]  Like what are you talking about that
[14258.64s -> 14260.64s]  These players are crazy
[14260.88s -> 14264.32s]  It just feels to me like they're so angry at everything. It's kind of funny
[14266.48s -> 14271.04s]  Okay, I got three items now. I went for the pd because I kind of think the extra movement speed and the extra
[14272.00s -> 14274.00s]  Uh, it'll help a lot
[14275.68s -> 14277.84s]  I will say both the junglers are playing really well
[14278.80s -> 14280.64s]  this game is like
[14280.64s -> 14282.64s]  interesting
[14282.88s -> 14286.40s]  Like both the assassin junglers are playing pretty well the enemy zaras playing pretty decent
[14290.80s -> 14292.80s]  Oh
[14293.52s -> 14295.52s]  What
[14295.52s -> 14299.68s]  That is not a I I mean that was embarrassing like I don't even have words for that
[14301.68s -> 14303.68s]  Like I genuinely don't have words for that shit
[14306.16s -> 14308.16s]  I missed
[14311.84s -> 14314.16s]  I can't see we have no vision man
[14320.88s -> 14322.88s]  Like we have no vision
[14323.52s -> 14326.32s]  Nothing's warded because the mumu didn't put any wards down
[14329.52s -> 14334.64s]  So I can't fight because literally we're standing there in this area and there's nothing warded
[14339.52s -> 14343.68s]  The best part is all a mumu had to do was not die before that fight and we auto win
[14344.32s -> 14346.32s]  Like we were winning so hard
[14346.56s -> 14350.00s]  But this a mumu is actually so losing us the game with this fucking ego
[14350.96s -> 14353.46s]  God support players are so bad at league
[14355.92s -> 14357.92s]  Actually
[14359.36s -> 14363.68s]  And they'll deflect support players will will lie to themselves about how good they are
[14364.00s -> 14367.84s]  And tell them that it's always their team's fault, but they'll drop nine deaths
[14368.48s -> 14373.28s]  Have nine kp in a fucking 23 kill game and then blame their fucking team
[14375.12s -> 14377.12s]  It's crazy
[14381.12s -> 14386.08s]  Please ward things man
[14394.40s -> 14397.12s]  Oh my god, he's dead again
[14404.32s -> 14408.32s]  Guys why are we up here top? Why are we top guys?
[14411.60s -> 14413.60s]  I
[14415.20s -> 14417.20s]  Why are we three manning top right now?
[14418.48s -> 14420.48s]  Holy crap
[14421.20s -> 14425.36s]  My teammates are absolute apes like what am I watching men?
[14428.16s -> 14430.16s]  They they just three man's top
[14432.64s -> 14434.64s]  Oh my god
[14434.64s -> 14440.16s]  Like these are the worst players I've ever fucking seen
[14441.76s -> 14443.76s]  Like we we had the game in our hands
[14444.40s -> 14450.16s]  And then all of a sudden my team's like, you know what I don't actually want to win and I'm like why and they're like well you see
[14452.24s -> 14454.64s]  I have an ego and you're like, oh I see
[14455.36s -> 14458.08s]  This is why I can't play ad carry and silo. I'm sorry
[14458.72s -> 14462.96s]  I can't I have to play support in the silo because ad carry is actually not playable
[14465.04s -> 14468.08s]  When the entire game is decided by jungle support
[14468.80s -> 14470.48s]  and mid
[14470.48s -> 14474.40s]  Ad carry just does not decide any of the league of legends games below grandmaster
[14474.96s -> 14476.96s]  Not one of them like last game
[14477.12s -> 14479.76s]  We popped off and we won because we were the better ad carry, right?
[14480.72s -> 14482.72s]  This game it doesn't matter
[14482.80s -> 14487.04s]  Because tf does 11k damage doesn't ulti bot more than one time
[14487.68s -> 14489.68s]  Like rengar did well
[14489.68s -> 14492.74s]  Narr did well, but they also had a horrible macro
[14495.04s -> 14501.52s]  Like it is insane to me how easy support is as a role and just how dog shit every support player is on the server
[14502.48s -> 14504.96s]  Like your role requires zero thought
[14505.92s -> 14507.92s]  your thought when playing support
[14508.40s -> 14509.68s]  is
[14509.68s -> 14511.68s]  Do I get vision or not?
[14511.92s -> 14514.64s]  If no, where can I be the most useful?
[14515.52s -> 14519.36s]  Your thought should never be this game's over my team sucks
[14519.36s -> 14524.24s]  It drives me ludicrous
[14528.24s -> 14530.72s]  Like I'm sorry that I have to play support on this account to climb
[14531.04s -> 14534.96s]  But it's crazy how dog shit ad carry is when you're solo queuing and masters
[14535.68s -> 14539.68s]  Like in in gm like if it's a full gm game ad carry is easy as fuck
[14540.08s -> 14544.08s]  Like if everybody has a brain activity and they're not idiots ad carry is amazing
[14544.48s -> 14546.96s]  Favorite role in the game when you're playing with people
[14547.36s -> 14550.16s]  Who don't know what they're doing and you're actively trying to climb and improve
[14550.64s -> 14556.64s]  It genuinely feels like i'm pulling out a ball hair with my tweezers or pulling out my ball hairs with tweezers
[14557.28s -> 14559.28s]  Like one by one
[14559.28s -> 14561.28s]  It is so painful
[14564.32s -> 14566.32s]  It's crazy
[14568.64s -> 14574.64s]  Like let's take a look at this this support main right now 97 lp negative win rate, right?
[14575.04s -> 14582.24s]  I could I could literally tell that he was not a good player in the first 30 seconds of that game
[14587.36s -> 14590.16s]  I'm sorry i'm being mean, but dude this has been driving me crazy
[14594.32s -> 14600.48s]  Like look at the look at the support I had last game also, can I ask a question? Why am I even allowed?
[14601.36s -> 14608.88s]  Why am I even allowed to be in games with a challenger support one game? I win the game
[14609.84s -> 14616.16s]  Then immediately it puts me in a game with a 97 lp master support
[14620.80s -> 14622.80s]  What is this matchmaking?
[14627.76s -> 14629.76s]  This is insane
[14630.96s -> 14632.96s]  That's crazy
[14646.96s -> 14648.96s]  I
[14649.04s -> 14651.04s]  I
[14651.04s -> 14653.04s]  I don't even I'm wondering
[14654.00s -> 14656.00s]  I
[14656.80s -> 14660.16s]  I I don't even I'm wondering why
[14663.76s -> 14666.88s]  So I'm gonna go on a rant for a second. Why is this allowed?
[14667.76s -> 14673.20s]  Why can you be in a game? Why can I be in a game with a literal guy who's about to promote to challenger?
[14674.32s -> 14680.56s]  Right we win the game and then the very next game it puts me in a game with a guy who's 97 lp
[14683.12s -> 14685.12s]  This is insane
[14685.12s -> 14687.12s]  This is insane
[14700.80s -> 14706.32s]  Sorry that's just frustrating as fuck because it's like such bad game design
[14708.88s -> 14711.84s]  Right like that's that's 900 lp difference
[14715.68s -> 14719.68s]  And the thing is this guy doesn't have good mmR
[14720.48s -> 14723.44s]  Right like like it's not it's not like this guy has good mmR
[14724.40s -> 14726.40s]  Right
[14726.40s -> 14734.00s]  Because look at his games. He's playing with all masters players. They're all like 100 lp masters 70 lp 30 lp, right?
[14734.96s -> 14738.24s]  It doesn't make sense. It's not like his mmR is high
[14738.24s -> 14743.36s]  So why is this guy getting into like a 600 lp grandmaster game?
[14743.92s -> 14750.72s]  Why are we putting that guy in the game? That's so frustrating. Sorry. I just I needed events
[14757.20s -> 14762.40s]  How do you know which ad carry to pick in each situation, uh, it's a lot of knowledge a lot of knowledge
[14764.40s -> 14766.40s]  Like you have to know
[14766.88s -> 14768.32s]  A lot of shit
[14768.40s -> 14774.00s]  Like what the enemy champions do what your champions need to do to to win the game what the win cons are
[14775.20s -> 14777.04s]  You can just pick
[14777.04s -> 14779.04s]  I'm being honest though. You could just pick a
[14781.44s -> 14785.68s]  Like there are ad carries in the current meta where you can just pick that are blind like I was making a tier list
[14785.68s -> 14787.12s]  I forgot about it
[14787.12s -> 14789.76s]  But I mean you can blind pick jinx pretty much every game
[14791.20s -> 14795.12s]  Like jinx is just blindable every game pretty much. She's insane. She's super op
[14796.08s -> 14801.52s]  So like if you if you ever just want to play a champion and you think like, okay, I want to practice ad like jinx is insane. Super good
[14805.52s -> 14810.88s]  Draven's not blindable, but I do think he's really good if you're good at the game draven's very good
[14812.08s -> 14815.44s]  He's he's he's harder than jinx by a mile like draven's a lot harder
[14816.00s -> 14819.60s]  But he's definitely like good at carrying with a lead as well
[14821.68s -> 14824.56s]  Like another blindable ad that I think's like a tier is like varus
[14825.28s -> 14827.28s]  You can blind pick varus really easily
[14827.44s -> 14829.44s]  Because varus doesn't really have counters
[14830.56s -> 14835.68s]  Like he doesn't get countered by anything. He's more of like a you can pick him and then
[14836.40s -> 14841.28s]  Go even and your ulti will always be useful. You can look to like win lane. You can look to like
[14842.08s -> 14844.08s]  Engage things like that, right?
[14855.52s -> 14857.52s]  So
[14868.32s -> 14872.88s]  Okay, so this game as the support I need to be tracking the jungler
[14875.04s -> 14877.04s]  So I'm gonna think where
[14877.04s -> 14880.48s]  Always be thinking what the enemy jungler wants to accomplish and how to stop it
[14880.64s -> 14883.04s]  That's like a pretty big tip of advice that I can give you guys
[14885.12s -> 14889.68s]  Like think to yourself like okay, if I was the enemy jungler, what would I be wanting to do against the scrams right as lee sin?
[14891.28s -> 14894.72s]  He's probably gonna want to either gank early like gank bot early or he wants to
[14895.68s -> 14897.68s]  um
[14897.68s -> 14903.04s]  Invade on certain timers right because that's like what lee is really good at is ganking and invading so
[14905.04s -> 14909.44s]  What I think I'm gonna try to do this game is I'm gonna try and
[14910.40s -> 14914.40s]  Watch for early ganks and early pressure bot lane like your level two level three ganks
[14915.36s -> 14921.28s]  We're still gonna be aggressive, but lux took tp, which means this lux does not plan on playing aggressive at all
[14922.16s -> 14924.96s]  Like she basically if anybody takes tp like this in a lane
[14926.08s -> 14929.60s]  I already know from start of the game that they're not planning on doing anything
[14930.00s -> 14932.00s]  So I'm probably gonna end up roaming a lot this game
[14932.80s -> 14934.80s]  This is a this is gonna be a game where I roam a ton
[14945.44s -> 14952.48s]  Uh, we do have some good ways to roam to to like roaming top and mid is both really good
[14964.88s -> 14966.88s]  I just wanted to ward early
[14968.40s -> 14970.40s]  Because I don't want to get shit on by way
[14971.76s -> 14973.28s]  So
[14973.28s -> 14975.28s]  Okay, I'm just gonna flash immediately
[14976.24s -> 14980.24s]  There's no reason to not flash there because alistar used this flash to get my flash
[14980.80s -> 14986.24s]  Which is totally fine. It's better for him because he has hex flash, but it's not that bad
[14990.72s -> 14995.20s]  Because uh, I can outrange him and I can stay away from his his shit
[14997.60s -> 14999.60s]  So we know he's in the bush we just chill
[15000.40s -> 15002.56s]  There it is. He fucked up now we go forward
[15004.24s -> 15008.24s]  I don't know why lux isn't throwing spells at this guy like like I don't know why she didn't cue him
[15009.52s -> 15011.60s]  Like he fucked up the alistar should have died there
[15013.28s -> 15014.96s]  And she's pinging me, okay
[15014.96s -> 15018.96s]  The alistar should have died there if alistar ever fucks up on a gauge like that where he hex flashes in
[15019.52s -> 15022.96s]  Get stuck like cue his cooldown. Yeah, I don't know why it was thrown is what I'm saying
[15023.52s -> 15025.84s]  You don't throw you don't throw spells that uh
[15026.64s -> 15028.64s]  That aren't gonna land
[15029.60s -> 15033.20s]  So there's no point in lux ever throwing her cue until alistar fucks up the combo
[15034.08s -> 15038.56s]  Like she should just poke with e and then um because it's almost like a blitz hook, right?
[15038.80s -> 15043.04s]  Think of it like a blitz hook if she throws the uh the cue out, right?
[15043.44s -> 15047.84s]  Now they have an opportunity to be aggressive because they know the hook they know the the hook is down
[15048.96s -> 15052.08s]  So it's better for her to just hold the hook essentially, right?
[15052.56s -> 15056.48s]  Hold the cue and now when alistar does go in
[15057.04s -> 15062.32s]  They have to be nervous about that cue because they can't just think oh the cue's down. Let's let's engage, right?
[15062.72s -> 15064.72s]  So they can't actually think about that
[15065.12s -> 15067.12s]  This is why I don't like
[15071.12s -> 15074.00s]  A lot of the time doing this like push push the wave
[15077.20s -> 15081.12s]  They can't engage on us without like flashing so it doesn't matter like look
[15082.80s -> 15084.80s]  Oh
[15085.12s -> 15087.92s]  Did she cue the wave again or am I an idiot?
[15090.24s -> 15092.64s]  Like just oh man, I'm losing my mind here
[15093.28s -> 15095.28s]  Oh these I'm I'm tilting
[15095.60s -> 15100.00s]  It's fine. I need to not tilt. I need to just chill but I'm getting frustrated because we're like
[15100.64s -> 15104.08s]  Not using cooldowns properly and it's driving me fucking crazy
[15107.76s -> 15111.36s]  Because these are very simple things to do you guys got to walk the wave in by the way
[15111.44s -> 15114.40s]  You can't let them freeze. Okay. They're very simple things to do
[15114.40s -> 15116.24s]  I know I'm being annoying a shit whining about this
[15116.24s -> 15121.60s]  But this is stuff that you you need to be thinking about when you're playing the game. Well, you should actively be thinking
[15122.24s -> 15124.24s]  uh
[15124.24s -> 15128.48s]  What can I do with my champions toolkit to stop their champions toolkit?
[15129.20s -> 15131.84s]  And you should be thinking okay. I have cue right?
[15132.64s -> 15138.16s]  So what do they want to do they want to go in okay, and when you're thinking they want to go in
[15138.88s -> 15144.32s]  Right you should be thinking okay when they go in I can just cue
[15145.12s -> 15147.12s]  And that should be your entire thought process
[15147.68s -> 15149.68s]  Your thought process should never be
[15150.80s -> 15154.32s]  Oh, maybe I can land a random cue at max range and we can get a kill
[15157.04s -> 15163.52s]  She cued the wave. Yes. That's what I mean like you should never cue the wave on lux either unless you're going to 100 reset
[15164.48s -> 15168.40s]  That would be like if I hooked the wave as like let's crank or some shits
[15168.88s -> 15171.60s]  Why is my lux bait pinging my graves?
[15172.48s -> 15175.68s]  Dude, I got to keep this 100 honest to the men
[15177.76s -> 15184.08s]  You don't get you you don't get to be mad here. Why are dude these players are such babies
[15187.68s -> 15190.88s]  Jesus christ what pussies men these people are such babies
[15193.76s -> 15196.08s]  The graves played correctly by the way like a hundred percent
[15197.52s -> 15199.52s]  He's mad at the graves for taking a wave
[15200.00s -> 15202.96s]  He wanted to not like he wanted to be able to TP back and get the wave
[15203.44s -> 15208.00s]  That's what this lux is so trash that she actually believes that's the graves fault
[15208.48s -> 15211.04s]  That graves misplayed by pushing the bot wave
[15211.76s -> 15213.76s]  But it was the right play
[15214.40s -> 15217.84s]  Pushing the bot wave was the correct play there because then she doesn't have to TP
[15218.32s -> 15220.64s]  The whole reason that he's pushing it is to save her teleport
[15221.36s -> 15223.36s]  So that she doesn't have to TP to lane
[15227.60s -> 15230.96s]  Players like this are why the game is hard to play right now in the current meta
[15231.60s -> 15233.20s]  Why it feels bad
[15233.20s -> 15238.24s]  Because this lux is trash everybody you guys can all see this lux is terrible. She's already made a bunch of mistakes
[15238.32s -> 15240.80s]  She's blaming her team. She's being a dipshit, right?
[15241.68s -> 15243.68s]  but
[15244.08s -> 15246.40s]  She can climb up to this elo being this bad
[15247.36s -> 15251.76s]  Because of the system the current system in place
[15262.48s -> 15264.48s]  Okay
[15268.48s -> 15271.28s]  We should immediately do baron here dragon. I mean we should do this
[15271.44s -> 15278.16s]  Come you don't have time for this. Just come do dragon
[15279.92s -> 15282.32s]  Bro the leasing just showed top we should be doing dragon
[15288.08s -> 15290.08s]  When um
[15297.36s -> 15299.84s]  When this shit happens by the way where you have um
[15300.80s -> 15307.12s]  Enemy jungler shows on one side of the map you should always be playing on the other side of the map to make a counter play
[15308.16s -> 15312.88s]  So jungler shows on top side we go for dragon, right easy
[15317.68s -> 15322.88s]  Yo be careful alistar is going to be there xerath is going to be there just leave just leave leave of leaf
[15325.04s -> 15327.28s]  I'll do it for you. I'll make you leave. I got you man
[15329.92s -> 15333.36s]  But we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and um
[15334.00s -> 15336.72s]  I need to back now, but we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back
[15337.76s -> 15339.76s]  And not only did their bot lane have to back but
[15341.52s -> 15343.52s]  The enemy was top
[15348.40s -> 15350.72s]  I I tried man I tried to flash q him
[15354.56s -> 15358.72s]  But yeah, it's it's really I don't know a lot of junglers don't I don't think they know what they're
[15358.80s -> 15362.48s]  Oh, I'm dead by the way. I'm not even gonna pop exhaust. I'm just dead
[15364.08s -> 15365.92s]  A lot of junglers don't know
[15365.92s -> 15370.40s]  What the goal of the game actually is a lot of them think it's I think that was a bad insect
[15370.40s -> 15375.44s]  But a lot of junglers think the goal of the game is to like get as much farm as you can and run over the enemy team and
[15375.44s -> 15378.48s]  Shit, but it's actually it is but it's also about like
[15379.36s -> 15383.36s]  Getting early objectives and turning those small leads and a big leads through objective control
[15384.24s -> 15386.24s]  right
[15386.56s -> 15389.52s]  So like right now I want to rotate top rift is up
[15389.60s -> 15391.76s]  I know lee sin is going to be on top side of the map right now
[15392.32s -> 15393.84s]  I want to rotate top
[15393.84s -> 15399.20s]  So that I can help my team by being in the top side of the map because that's where the next play is going to be made
[15403.68s -> 15406.18s]  Well the play is made mid, but I mean I'm here so it's fine
[15413.36s -> 15415.36s]  Oh my god
[15416.24s -> 15418.24s]  I
[15418.64s -> 15422.72s]  Did not think the fucking lee sin would be there too. Oh
[15424.56s -> 15426.56s]  Oops
[15429.20s -> 15435.12s]  This is rough, I don't really know how to how to play this because I got there in time to counter the gank
[15436.08s -> 15437.20s]  right
[15437.20s -> 15441.20s]  I exhausted the guys saved the xerath. I got there in time to counter the gank, but
[15441.76s -> 15443.76s]  Oh
[15444.64s -> 15446.64s]  Well played
[15447.04s -> 15449.04s]  That's actually mega well played
[15451.12s -> 15453.12s]  That was really good
[15454.56s -> 15456.56s]  I want to push this way then but I can't
[15465.36s -> 15470.88s]  Like uh, you guys are noticing there's no objectives taken on the map yet at 10 minutes, which is kind of crazy
[15471.76s -> 15475.44s]  The ally's doing really good. The ally's is not a bad support player. He's playing well
[15484.64s -> 15486.64s]  Like he's playing very well
[15493.92s -> 15498.00s]  A lot of this is more of like I need I don't have anything to do on the map because uh
[15498.88s -> 15501.60s]  I'm trying to help my jungler, but my jungler is trolling
[15502.88s -> 15504.88s]  It's really rough
[15505.04s -> 15508.48s]  Because like I'm trying to rotate over and help my jungler on cooldown basically right
[15509.04s -> 15514.08s]  But my jungler doesn't want to fight you see like I'm countering the alicers fight or ganks. It's just
[15521.12s -> 15523.12s]  I'm just dead
[15524.56s -> 15526.56s]  Dude
[15527.28s -> 15533.36s]  Like we shouldn't have made that play mid because we knew that they were all there and we knew that our jungler is doing this
[15534.96s -> 15536.96s]  This might just be a jungle diff honestly
[15538.88s -> 15542.72s]  Like our adc sucks, but it might just be a straight up jungle diff game. They do happen
[15544.80s -> 15548.32s]  Especially in this elo where jungler has so much control of the game. They do happen
[15548.40s -> 15555.92s]  It's a pretty big jungle diff chip hoppy, you know it I know it
[15557.76s -> 15562.88s]  Like yeah, he's saying yeah, like he knows the jungle is getting out outclassed insanely hard
[15565.92s -> 15568.80s]  Because graves counters leeson it's like a massive counter
[15571.60s -> 15573.60s]  But this guy doesn't know what he's doing
[15574.48s -> 15579.92s]  I think he's a rangar one trick and rangar got banned. I think that's what's going on
[15581.28s -> 15587.92s]  It's a rangar one trick who got banned out and he tried to play a champion that requires thought not just a I jump you die champ
[15589.36s -> 15591.36s]  Right and he just gets shit on for it
[15596.80s -> 15599.36s]  I mean dude, I can't even I can't even do anything this game
[15599.76s -> 15603.92s]  Our top lenders getting his ass whipped too. It's really fucking rough
[15608.56s -> 15612.96s]  I mean he's in here. I'm pretty sure it's not it was just it was warded though
[15614.40s -> 15617.12s]  I mean we can't really do anything here. I'm I'm dead. I think
[15618.24s -> 15620.24s]  Yeah, I'm just dead
[15620.56s -> 15624.08s]  This is just rough. I I kind of want to go next because I don't think
[15625.28s -> 15627.52s]  I don't think we have the skill on the team to win
[15629.44s -> 15634.32s]  The jungle death is huge the 80 death is huge and I'm just I can't I can't impact the map
[15648.16s -> 15651.44s]  Like I can't I just can't do anything this game to impact the map and it feels really bad
[15660.00s -> 15662.00s]  Oh
[15662.80s -> 15664.80s]  Son of a bitch I should have flashed
[15667.76s -> 15671.20s]  I got like creep blocked a little bit when he knocked me in I like had to walk through I should just flashed up
[15671.20s -> 15672.32s]  That's my man
[15672.32s -> 15675.44s]  Like what was that tp man? Oh god get me out
[15676.32s -> 15679.60s]  I'm gonna be a hundred percent real get me out that tp was miserably bad
[15680.48s -> 15682.48s]  Dude just tp'd to the wave
[15690.32s -> 15696.08s]  Like what is our blocks doing to like I just feel like everybody's late to the fights
[15697.76s -> 15699.76s]  Blocks is always late to the fights
[15700.32s -> 15703.92s]  The graves doesn't want to take fights even though he's playing graves in the Lee Sin
[15704.88s -> 15707.68s]  Like I I feel like oh, this is rough. This is a rough game
[15708.72s -> 15710.72s]  Games like this tilt me and I kind of just want to go next
[15711.60s -> 15715.76s]  Because games like this I they are winnable, but I feel like I want to go next to save mental, you know
[15716.88s -> 15718.88s]  Like low-key. I just want to save my mental
[15720.16s -> 15722.16s]  I
[15729.04s -> 15731.04s]  Because oh, it's so gross
[15732.64s -> 15736.88s]  Like watching what lux did in the early stages of the lane phase just wasting her q on repeat
[15737.28s -> 15741.76s]  That was one of the most embarrassing things ever and then like look at that. She just q'd a minion
[15749.36s -> 15751.36s]  Oh
[15756.80s -> 15760.24s]  Bro like oh my god, you gotta push the wave man
[15764.32s -> 15766.32s]  Holy shits
[15768.64s -> 15770.64s]  I mean I can't I can't even walk
[15776.32s -> 15778.32s]  Oh my god
[15779.04s -> 15781.20s]  I don't even have help from my fucking team
[15782.88s -> 15784.88s]  That's the worst part about this
[15786.08s -> 15788.08s]  Oh
[15788.64s -> 15791.76s]  Dude these games feel so unplayable man
[15793.68s -> 15797.28s]  Like I don't know how else to say it except for they just feel miserable to play
[15800.24s -> 15806.08s]  Like I'm trying to focus on playing like improving myself, but it's so hard to know how to improve in games where like
[15808.32s -> 15810.32s]  You genuinely just
[15810.40s -> 15812.40s]  Get no help
[15816.72s -> 15819.44s]  My lux has been tilted since like minute two for some reason
[15820.08s -> 15824.16s]  And my graves has been completely pathing wrong doing wrong shit
[15824.96s -> 15828.96s]  It's hard to know how to help like I went mid to help countered two of the early ganks
[15829.84s -> 15831.84s]  Lux still griefed the game
[15833.60s -> 15836.64s]  So like yeah, it's just it's hard to know and then top lane lost
[15839.28s -> 15841.28s]  It's so rough man
[15846.08s -> 15851.68s]  Like I'm gonna keep it a hundred percent honest with you if you are a one trick do not try and play other champs
[15853.44s -> 15855.44s]  You you will int
[15858.64s -> 15860.64s]  You will play badly always and you will int
[15861.68s -> 15864.56s]  And you will you will like look at this this is
[15865.44s -> 15867.44s]  2.9k damage as a
[15867.92s -> 15869.92s]  Dude like what are we doing?
[15873.68s -> 15878.40s]  How are these people getting into this elo, how does this locks like in the game
[15880.32s -> 15887.76s]  She was against an alistar bot and she did 1.2.9k damage in a 16 minute game
[15888.48s -> 15890.48s]  Against a melee heavy team
[15892.08s -> 15894.08s]  Like what is this what is happening
[15895.04s -> 15898.64s]  This guy was d4 30 lp last season
[15901.36s -> 15903.36s]  And now he's magically in masters
[15908.16s -> 15911.68s]  No, we need to fix matchmaking this is this is insane
[15917.12s -> 15919.44s]  Like this is just a matchmaking diff it's nothing else
[15920.40s -> 15922.40s]  My man literally
[15922.56s -> 15929.04s]  Does not belong in master tier 400 lp mmr at all. Well, you can see that he's not at this level
[15943.92s -> 15946.08s]  Dude I have the Lux player on my team again
[15946.08s -> 15948.08s]  Oh
[15954.96s -> 15958.80s]  This is zerith one trick and a Rengar one trick on the enemy team
[15961.92s -> 15966.48s]  I don't know man, I guess I care more about the Rengar than the zerith, but
[15969.84s -> 15971.84s]  This is rough
[15976.72s -> 15978.72s]  Oh
[15983.12s -> 15987.52s]  What's up chupapi dude, sorry, I hit yes on that man. I know the game was winnable
[15987.60s -> 15992.48s]  I'm gonna be real but dude, you didn't see what I saw during the early game of that game chupapi
[15993.12s -> 15995.12s]  like man
[15996.40s -> 15998.72s]  The entire early game of that game was like
[15999.60s -> 16001.60s]  We lost lane
[16001.60s -> 16007.84s]  Because lux wouldn't use her q to fight the alistar. She was using it to farm minions
[16009.28s -> 16012.80s]  Like she was so scared of being engaged on by the alistar and the callista
[16013.52s -> 16016.72s]  That she would use her q to max range farm minions
[16017.76s -> 16020.88s]  Instead of save it. So when the alistar engages we just kill him
[16022.64s -> 16025.84s]  Right because if alistar ever engages on me and lux he just gets killed
[16026.40s -> 16029.36s]  We just bind him walk away and he's stuck there and he dies, right?
[16030.08s -> 16032.08s]  But for some reason
[16033.68s -> 16036.48s]  She didn't understand how to do that. So she was just throwing it to farm
[16036.48s -> 16042.08s]  So we would just get engaged on so I started roaming and every time I was like roaming to an objective or something
[16042.48s -> 16045.44s]  The graves would always walk away and not fight
[16046.00s -> 16049.60s]  Like he wasn't attempting to fight. He was basically just like, oh, I'm gonna go farm some more
[16049.92s -> 16053.52s]  But I'm like, dude, you can't do that. Like if the alistar's ganking mid and I'm countering mid
[16053.76s -> 16058.00s]  You can't just farm farm before coming mid or you can't just like not take dragon and shit like that, right?
[16058.08s -> 16064.24s]  Like it blows my mind that these players can get like it's like this guy too. Same thing like that jungler last game, right?
[16064.96s -> 16068.64s]  Look at this. It's the same thing as the last game. Like na is riddled with this shit
[16068.72s -> 16072.24s]  It's it's so miserable to play. Look at this this jungler last game, right?
[16072.56s -> 16076.08s]  He's not he's what like a d1 player, right? He's not a bad player. He beats d1
[16076.40s -> 16078.40s]  But why is this guy in this game now?
[16078.40s -> 16082.32s]  He like artificially inflated to the silo getting lucky with his first few games
[16082.96s -> 16086.08s]  And now we have to play with this guy. Oh, it's an account share
[16088.96s -> 16093.28s]  The person it's a different player. Look on the account
[16094.88s -> 16096.88s]  D flash f flash
[16098.40s -> 16100.88s]  So, uh, it's a fucking account share
[16103.04s -> 16105.04s]  That's that's frustrating
[16112.00s -> 16115.04s]  Sorry for whining so much guys this shit's just really frustrating to me
[16116.00s -> 16123.04s]  Like I know I should play it to like specifically only care about like improving and then while you're improving you'll climb automatically and shit
[16123.60s -> 16125.60s]  But it's really frustrating when like
[16127.36s -> 16131.28s]  The players in the game would rather be idiots and assholes to each other than play the game
[16131.76s -> 16135.84s]  Right like the game before the amumu right the game before this the amumu was just being toxic
[16135.84s -> 16140.88s]  The whole game and into the win away the last game the locks and the graves were being toxic to each other
[16140.88s -> 16142.88s]  The whole game we into the game away
[16143.76s -> 16151.36s]  It's like I it's it's not fun to lose because one player gets mad at another player over them both being idiots
[16154.40s -> 16161.04s]  I'm sorry. It's not fun. It's so unfun, but we'll try and we'll try and win this one
[16172.88s -> 16179.60s]  All we can really do is try and carry the games, right? It's about it. What is
[16189.20s -> 16191.20s]  What
[16192.08s -> 16194.72s]  What man, what what do you think they're gonna do to me?
[16194.96s -> 16200.64s]  Welcome to the league of yo, thank you for the seven months man. Welcome back. I really don't want to meet all
[16200.80s -> 16202.80s]  I don't I don't want to meet all
[16202.88s -> 16205.60s]  Because like I I I want to like value the pings and shit, but dude
[16217.04s -> 16221.54s]  If they walk up, I'm gonna flank them. That's why I'm standing here. Okay, they're in the main
[16233.04s -> 16235.04s]  You made standing in its sights
[16253.28s -> 16257.28s]  Well that was a big cue I need to get level two first here 100%
[16263.28s -> 16265.28s]  I
[16276.48s -> 16278.48s]  Should have just been autoing there that whole time
[16280.16s -> 16282.88s]  Because we have heal so she should have just walked up and autoed
[16283.52s -> 16288.32s]  As soon as uh, this is what I mean by tracking cooldowns as soon as the nico missed her
[16288.88s -> 16290.88s]  As soon as the nico missed her cooldown
[16290.96s -> 16295.60s]  As soon as she missed her e the ash should have just walked up and immediately started fighting
[16297.12s -> 16299.12s]  Right like because they can no longer kill us
[16301.04s -> 16304.00s]  The uh nico doesn't actually have spells outside of her e
[16304.88s -> 16309.44s]  Right, so if she misses that snare and she used her w too, right? So it's like we just go ham
[16310.16s -> 16312.16s]  You don't need to be too scared
[16313.68s -> 16317.28s]  It happens quite a bit sometimes where people will just be like really nervous
[16321.84s -> 16323.84s]  It's fun
[16335.28s -> 16338.72s]  Damn if I had dodged that cue I actually would have killed all three
[16339.52s -> 16344.48s]  Damn, I don't know if it was worth the flash after the guy. I actually I think it was if I had dodged the cue
[16344.48s -> 16346.48s]  I would have been fine
[16346.48s -> 16350.40s]  So that was it's whatever. I also doesn't miss any creeps here
[16350.96s -> 16352.96s]  So it's not the end of the world
[16356.40s -> 16359.44s]  Like I'm pretty sure Lee Sin did not have his top camps by the way
[16366.80s -> 16371.12s]  Damn if I was a little better mechanically I turned that by the way 100
[16374.08s -> 16377.44s]  We should push this wave so that I can go get vision
[16381.12s -> 16383.12s]  I
[16397.92s -> 16400.24s]  Is yeah that guy can't freeze that wave so
[16403.44s -> 16405.44s]  Sounds too bad
[16411.28s -> 16413.28s]  I
[16416.24s -> 16418.24s]  Lee Sin's top
[16424.96s -> 16427.28s]  You can kind of see some really good, uh
[16431.36s -> 16434.56s]  What is this why's my cart this afk turret?
[16435.52s -> 16439.52s]  What is happening right now
[16452.48s -> 16454.48s]  Why was he afk
[16465.04s -> 16470.32s]  I mean, I guess it worked out, but yeah, maybe you had to go let his cat out. I don't know
[16472.72s -> 16474.72s]  Happens
[16480.00s -> 16485.28s]  We do their bot lane is not very good. They're trying too hard to force fights that they can't win
[16489.84s -> 16492.56s]  Like they they genuinely can't win half these fights that they're trying to force
[16492.80s -> 16496.96s]  Maybe if they were against people who like don't push their buttons they could win those
[16497.04s -> 16499.68s]  But it's like all I have to do is stand there and fight back and they lose
[16500.80s -> 16504.56s]  They're on dragon a thousand percent right now. There's not a lot I can do about that
[16505.84s -> 16508.72s]  Uh, we just have to chill. There's almost nothing I can do about it
[16509.36s -> 16512.32s]  Kai says trying to fake act like she's big, but it's just
[16516.00s -> 16518.00s]  There's just nothing we can do
[16518.32s -> 16521.84s]  Because our car this is top so we just chill
[16526.64s -> 16529.20s]  They finish the chair west no no no not yet
[16530.80s -> 16532.80s]  Whoa
[16533.68s -> 16535.68s]  Uh lisa and could be bot right now
[16537.52s -> 16541.92s]  Hmm, I don't think it's too bad if he's bought though. They can't really dive us especially with car this holds
[16548.40s -> 16550.40s]  I
[16557.84s -> 16559.84s]  Why does my ash just run
[16564.80s -> 16567.92s]  She like just straight up runs away it's kind of silly
[16568.24s -> 16581.68s]  Because we have we have car this ulti like we can win a fight or a we can win a fight bot right now
[16585.60s -> 16588.80s]  I guess I guess I'm just gonna have to get them low enough for car this to kill them
[16590.56s -> 16595.44s]  Like without the ash's help, which I think I can do it's not too bad
[16597.92s -> 16599.92s]  Okay, the Akali's coming bot
[16600.64s -> 16602.64s]  We just killed them. I mean let's just fight
[16610.88s -> 16615.76s]  I don't know why we should just ash arrow honestly just ash arrow
[16621.60s -> 16623.60s]  Okay, that was pretty bad ash arrow but
[16628.40s -> 16630.40s]  I
[16630.80s -> 16633.68s]  Filled uh, I don't think he's filled. I think he's just having a bad game
[16635.20s -> 16638.64s]  I got it happens, you know, whoa, okay
[16642.80s -> 16644.80s]  Do it ult me I fucking dare you
[16649.36s -> 16652.80s]  I'm trying to keep some mana so that I can ulti
[16657.92s -> 16659.92s]  So
[16666.80s -> 16668.96s]  Oh car this already used his ults fuck
[16675.44s -> 16677.44s]  They both backed there wow
[16681.84s -> 16684.24s]  My bad, I honestly didn't think they were both gonna back there
[16684.56s -> 16692.08s]  Like I thought the kaisa was gonna back right where I saw her like last that was my bad. I should be
[16693.36s -> 16695.36s]  I think we sin can come bot here and kill me
[16698.16s -> 16700.16s]  I should actually stop this guy's back
[16704.96s -> 16710.96s]  Yeah, I should stop his back because it's more value to stop the back now even if we sin isn't bot it's more value
[16711.44s -> 16713.44s]  Because he's so low
[16714.48s -> 16716.48s]  Collie is Mia though, so we got to be care
[16718.24s -> 16728.16s]  I wasted my ult though, which makes me kind of scared. The other thing that kind of sucks about this is we don't have good vision
[16734.80s -> 16738.80s]  And I can't really help anybody on the map because the same thing is happening as before
[16738.80s -> 16741.68s]  We're like we're missing opportunities to get kills on timers
[16745.04s -> 16751.12s]  I mean the dog lightning guy's playing fine this game. I think he's trolled a lot like he's he's trolling. This isn't like his best game
[16752.48s -> 16756.40s]  But it's also I don't know why we're getting so tilted around the map right now
[16757.20s -> 16760.00s]  Because if I'm if I'm being honest, we should just win the game off of like
[16761.68s -> 16763.68s]  Being better players
[16769.44s -> 16774.80s]  I don't know what this car this is thinking but
[16780.40s -> 16783.92s]  Do it do to the car this we can fight we can fight just fight
[16787.36s -> 16789.36s]  Bro, what are we doing?
[16790.72s -> 16793.36s]  I'm losing it man. Ah, no, no, no. I'm tilted
[16793.84s -> 16795.84s]  I'm tilted as fuck. He didn't walk in
[16795.84s -> 16799.18s]  Just go on to the Akali Shroud, man.
[16800.44s -> 16804.44s]  Like, just walk a foot to your right and stand on the Akali Shroud.
[16804.84s -> 16808.94s]  She just eats your damage, like, while she's in the Shroud. She can't stop that.
[16812.94s -> 16814.94s]  Holy shit, I'm losing my minds.
[16816.94s -> 16821.24s]  Like, Ash is just inting bot waves right now, not trying to do anything.
[16822.24s -> 16826.94s]  Wax is really far up on CS, which is really good, but I'm losing it, man.
[16828.74s -> 16831.24s]  Like, we see exactly where they are every game.
[16831.64s -> 16834.44s]  Like, we see where everybody is on the enemy team permanently,
[16834.44s -> 16837.24s]  and we still can't manage to, like, walk to the right location.
[16838.04s -> 16839.44s]  This is driving me crazy.
[16841.94s -> 16843.64s]  My-my Karthus?
[16843.94s -> 16846.44s]  80-my Karthus jungle is getting out farmed?
[16847.04s -> 16849.64s]  Like, a Karthus jungle is getting out farmed by a Lee Sin jungle.
[16849.94s -> 16851.04s]  That's insane.
[16851.94s -> 16854.94s]  Like, I don't think- I don't think I can stress enough how crazy that is.
[16857.74s -> 16860.64s]  Like, there should never be a world where Karthus ever gets out farmed.
[16865.64s -> 16866.54s]  No way.
[16867.74s -> 16868.34s]  I'm dead.
[16868.74s -> 16871.44s]  Dude, no way I just fucking ate the end of that.
[16871.74s -> 16872.74s]  Now I'm playing that.
[16872.94s -> 16874.94s]  Just kill the Lee Sin, man!
[16881.94s -> 16883.44s]  I fucked up there.
[16884.74s -> 16887.14s]  That was my fault, because I got hit by the tip of the-
[16887.54s -> 16888.54s]  That was my fault.
[16888.54s -> 16891.94s]  I got barely clipped by the tip of the Niko ult when I was trying to space, because I'm bad.
[16892.74s -> 16896.74s]  And if I was alive there, and I could have saved my flash for the Lee Sin Q, we just win.
[16898.74s -> 16902.74s]  I am confused at why we decided to, like, not fight that immediately, though.
[16903.74s -> 16907.74s]  Like, we-we caught out two of their members, and we just got scared for whatever reason.
[16908.24s -> 16909.24s]  Wait, we went down.
[16909.74s -> 16911.74s]  Wait, we went in this fight.
[16912.74s -> 16914.74s]  We 1,000% win this. Fight this, fight this, fight this.
[16928.74s -> 16931.74s]  Bro, do not throw a fucking temper tantrum right now.
[16932.24s -> 16933.24s]  There's one kill?
[16933.74s -> 16934.74s]  Do not throw a temper tantrum.
[16935.24s -> 16937.24s]  Oh my god, here we go.
[16938.24s -> 16940.24s]  I took one kill. The guy's about to lose his mind, guys.
[16949.24s -> 16950.24s]  I need to mute all.
[16950.74s -> 16952.24s]  I'm gonna mute all in a second.
[16953.24s -> 16955.24s]  Like, I-I can't with these people right now.
[16958.24s -> 16961.24s]  Like, I can't, man. You people are disgusting.
[16961.74s -> 16963.24s]  Like, you guys just...
[16963.74s -> 16968.24s]  Wine, you play bad, you whine, and you bitch about every little mistake that everything happens.
[16968.74s -> 16972.24s]  Even though it's like, in the middle of a fight, I guarantee I'm a better player than you are.
[16972.74s -> 16975.74s]  And you're still whining and crying over one shutdown that, like,
[16976.24s -> 16978.74s]  you didn't even walk to until I spam pinged you.
[16978.74s -> 16982.74s]  Like, I literally 1v2'd them, you hit 1E, and now you're mad.
[16985.24s -> 16986.24s]  Dude, I swear.
[16986.74s -> 16988.74s]  League players are fucking psychopaths.
[16989.24s -> 16990.74s]  At least I got the exhaust off.
[16991.24s -> 16992.74s]  Surely she dies, right?
[16993.24s -> 16994.74s]  Surely she dies here.
[16995.24s -> 16996.24s]  Or not. Okay.
[16997.24s -> 16998.24s]  Okay, at least she died.
[16999.74s -> 17001.24s]  Help each other, guys.
[17002.24s -> 17003.74s]  Help each other? Teamwork?
[17006.24s -> 17007.74s]  Teamwork, teamwork, teamwork.
[17007.74s -> 17008.74s]  Teamwork.
[17009.24s -> 17011.24s]  Wait, this Ash is insane.
[17015.24s -> 17018.24s]  Okay, I'm not gonna lie. That Ash played that so good.
[17018.74s -> 17021.24s]  I only saw the end of it, and she still played that good.
[17022.24s -> 17023.24s]  That was sick.
[17024.74s -> 17027.24s]  Well done. That was actually really good.
[17028.24s -> 17030.24s]  Okay, I'm going to go back to the game.
[17031.24s -> 17033.24s]  I'm going to go back to the game.
[17034.24s -> 17036.24s]  I'm going to go back to the game.
[17036.24s -> 17037.74s]  That was actually really good.
[17039.74s -> 17041.74s]  She almost stopped the dive.
[17042.24s -> 17043.24s]  That's crazy.
[17047.74s -> 17050.74s]  This game is definitely 1,000% still winnable, though.
[17051.24s -> 17055.74s]  We just have to play for late game and not lose our fucking mines.
[17056.24s -> 17057.74s]  I'll let that push back into my Ash.
[17057.74s -> 17059.74s]  I'll go mid and get some vision.
[17062.24s -> 17063.74s]  That's pretty much all we have to do.
[17064.74s -> 17066.74s]  Play for late and not lose our mind early.
[17071.74s -> 17073.74s]  We could play to kill this Akali right now.
[17073.74s -> 17075.74s]  She doesn't know. There's no ward here.
[17076.74s -> 17078.74s]  We could also invade here.
[17081.74s -> 17083.24s]  Oh, that's so unlucky.
[17084.24s -> 17086.24s]  That was such a close queue.
[17090.74s -> 17092.24s]  Kill that guy.
[17093.74s -> 17095.24s]  Kill that guy.
[17113.74s -> 17115.24s]  Jesus Christ.
[17119.24s -> 17121.24s]  I feel like we should have won that fight.
[17122.24s -> 17124.24s]  I feel like something awkward happened and we lost.
[17125.24s -> 17129.24s]  Did my Ash just walk directly into the Akali and not use her ulti?
[17129.24s -> 17132.24s]  Use your ulti. You have ulti. Use your ulti.
[17132.74s -> 17133.74s]  Oh my god.
[17142.24s -> 17143.24s]  What the fuck?
[17145.24s -> 17146.74s]  Oh my god.
[17148.74s -> 17150.74s]  I don't even know what to say right now.
[17151.74s -> 17152.74s]  This is insane.
[17154.24s -> 17157.24s]  This genuinely feels like everybody in the game is losing their mind
[17157.24s -> 17159.74s]  in the freest game I've ever seen in my life.
[17163.74s -> 17166.24s]  Like that's what we're losing to right there, that guy.
[17166.74s -> 17170.24s]  The guy who like doesn't understand how Senna works.
[17170.74s -> 17172.74s]  Like that player. That's why I'm frustrated.
[17172.74s -> 17176.74s]  Like that player right there has no idea how Senna works.
[17177.24s -> 17178.74s]  Tries to fight me.
[17179.24s -> 17180.74s]  And we're like losing to that guy.
[17181.74s -> 17185.74s]  Like I'm trying really hard not to be an asshole but like it's flooding out right now from these games.
[17187.74s -> 17188.74s]  It's crazy.
[17192.24s -> 17194.24s]  Like he's so toxic. Look at this.
[17194.74s -> 17197.24s]  He went proto belt Ionia boot.
[17199.74s -> 17203.24s]  Niko but like that doesn't do anything to help his team.
[17211.24s -> 17214.24s]  You could arrow that guy. I mean it's not impossible.
[17215.74s -> 17217.24s]  Or don't. That's fine.
[17231.74s -> 17232.74s]  Oh my god.
[17233.24s -> 17235.24s]  Guys I think my luck since AFK.
[17238.24s -> 17240.24s]  She's been sitting in base for like five minutes.
[17246.24s -> 17250.24s]  I think she's like it literally just throwing or some chips.
[17250.74s -> 17252.24s]  Alright let's push this wave.
[17253.24s -> 17257.24s]  I think she's like literally just throwing or some chips.
[17257.74s -> 17259.24s]  Alright let's push this wave.
[17259.74s -> 17261.74s]  We could make a pick right now.
[17266.74s -> 17267.74s]  Jax what are you doing man?
[17267.74s -> 17268.74s]  Why are you up there?
[17268.74s -> 17269.74s]  Oh no.
[17271.74s -> 17274.74s]  Also why does this Ash have the worst build I've ever seen?
[17275.74s -> 17276.74s]  I don't know.
[17277.74s -> 17278.74s]  I don't know.
[17279.74s -> 17280.74s]  I don't know.
[17280.74s -> 17281.74s]  I don't know.
[17281.74s -> 17282.74s]  I don't know.
[17282.74s -> 17283.74s]  I don't know.
[17283.74s -> 17284.74s]  I don't know.
[17284.74s -> 17285.74s]  I don't know.
[17285.74s -> 17286.74s]  I don't know.
[17286.74s -> 17289.24s]  Ash have the worst build I've ever seen.
[17296.24s -> 17299.24s]  Dude if we lose to the Kaisa that just did that I'm gonna lose my mind.
[17299.74s -> 17300.74s]  Okay.
[17314.74s -> 17318.74s]  Wait that guy just blind art in without any vision of anybody and just died.
[17319.74s -> 17320.74s]  There's no way we can lose this.
[17324.74s -> 17325.74s]  We got this guys just play.
[17329.24s -> 17334.74s]  Like I just need to I need help getting vision control on Baron and mid and then we can we can win.
[17335.74s -> 17336.74s]  We got this.
[17338.24s -> 17339.24s]  Jesus Christ.
[17359.24s -> 17360.24s]  Jesus Christ.
[17383.74s -> 17384.74s]  Right now.
[17389.24s -> 17393.24s]  I remember my nightmares wish I could remember to dream.
[17393.24s -> 17394.24s]  Okay.
[17416.24s -> 17419.24s]  I mean we still got Baron but he did get two of them I guess.
[17420.24s -> 17423.24s]  Or no we only yeah you got a card this an ash.
[17424.24s -> 17427.24s]  But we did get Baron which is very nice so.
[17433.24s -> 17435.24s]  I'm gonna go Dom's this game.
[17435.24s -> 17437.24s]  Normally I go.
[17438.74s -> 17441.24s]  Black Cleaver but I think I'm gonna go Dom's.
[17450.24s -> 17457.24s]  I need to get vision control on dragon and mid.
[17470.24s -> 17473.24s]  I need to get vision control and I need I need help to do it though.
[17474.24s -> 17476.24s]  I'm gonna act like I'm backing here.
[17480.24s -> 17485.24s]  We should just be pushing mid with Baron.
[17485.24s -> 17487.24s]  I don't know what we're doing.
[17488.24s -> 17491.24s]  Like like low key it should just be straight up like we go mid with Baron here.
[17502.24s -> 17505.24s]  What the fuck was that? That was a terrible play.
[17509.24s -> 17510.24s]  I don't know.
[17522.24s -> 17524.24s]  Guys just just come mid we have Baron.
[17533.24s -> 17536.24s]  Nice huge pick push mid push mid.
[17537.24s -> 17539.24s]  Fuck dragon just push mid.
[17545.24s -> 17547.24s]  Okay now we back off.
[17551.24s -> 17555.24s]  Oh I mean that was bad.
[17557.24s -> 17562.24s]  Guys back off back off back off leave leave leave leave please please just leave.
[17566.24s -> 17569.24s]  Guys you can leave you can leave we just go do dragon leave.
[17573.24s -> 17576.24s]  We still have so much gold to get on the map we can go get bot tier 2.
[17576.24s -> 17578.24s]  Bot tier 1 bot tier 2.
[17579.24s -> 17583.24s]  We have we have so much gold to get on the map it's not a big deal right like we don't need to end the game right this second.
[17584.24s -> 17590.24s]  We actually have Carthus and we have Jax too so like our scaling is really good.
[17596.24s -> 17598.24s]  I
[17620.24s -> 17621.24s]  Need to go get.
[17626.24s -> 17637.24s]  I need to go get my next item by enough gold to do it.
[17638.24s -> 17647.24s]  I also need to go get wards this sucks I'm on like a weird buy timer where like I don't have enough things to get you know what I'm just going to get my ward item.
[17648.24s -> 17655.24s]  I'm going to grab this for now just so we can actually get some power on the map because the map so dark and I think getting the ward item before finishing my last whisper items probably.
[17656.24s -> 17657.24s]  The smartest call.
[17662.24s -> 17666.24s]  I am a little concerned why we're not pushing bot with Jax we're pushing top.
[17668.24s -> 17674.24s]  And I'm also concerned why we're not playing for mid Pryo and we're just farming bot side.
[17675.24s -> 17677.24s]  This is such an awkward fucking thing.
[17677.24s -> 17690.24s]  We should just be playing for mid Pryo and use arrow to engage that's how we win we just use arrow to engage when they contest mid.
[17691.24s -> 17692.24s]  It's actually that easy.
[17699.24s -> 17701.24s]  Like low key it's actually that easy.
[17708.24s -> 17709.24s]  See watch now this guy's dead.
[17717.24s -> 17718.24s]  I mean that's fine with me.
[17720.24s -> 17722.24s]  You guys want to int to kill me that's totally fine.
[17722.24s -> 17723.24s]  That's fine.
[17736.24s -> 17738.24s]  They can get the inhib and then they can back up.
[17739.24s -> 17741.24s]  Yeah yeah get in here back up.
[17742.24s -> 17744.24s]  And then play for play for Baron.
[17747.24s -> 17751.24s]  They'll only have a few seconds to do this though so it's kind of scary because these two are going to be alive.
[17753.24s -> 17758.24s]  They need to back immediately.
[17763.24s -> 17765.24s]  Just reset you don't need the wave just leave leave leave.
[17766.24s -> 17768.24s]  Baron's up Baron's up think about the macro guys the macro.
[17769.24s -> 17770.24s]  We play for Baron now.
[17773.24s -> 17779.24s]  Because there's a timer now where like you guys just need to reset because there's a timer where the enemy has tempo on the map.
[17780.24s -> 17788.24s]  And if we don't if we don't allow if we don't reset they'll just rush Baron and there's nothing we can do about it.
[17798.24s -> 17803.24s]  Okay they're not on Baron I think they missed their timer they're on it no they're on it they're on it they're on it.
[17805.24s -> 17806.24s]  Okay they're not on it we're fine.
[17810.24s -> 17815.24s]  We can still fight this though but we need everybody here.
[17822.24s -> 17830.24s]  Just arrow arrow arrow arrow arrow it doesn't matter if you hit mouth just arrow just arrow him thank you.
[17831.24s -> 17849.24s]  No no guys the back line the back line play together play together yes nice end of the game.
[17852.24s -> 17853.24s]  You end you end here.
[17854.24s -> 17858.24s]  Watch don't back you are giving me cancer okay they forfeit it.
[17859.24s -> 17867.24s]  Dude look how easy that is look how easy it is to win games when people are listening to macro look how easy it is oh my god.
[17869.24s -> 17881.24s]  I'm losing it man I swear to god I'm losing my I could feel my hair falling out right now I can feel it falling out of my fucking head like Ijust lost the one that's right there like like it's just fucking kill me man.
[17882.24s -> 17890.24s]  In game god it's so hard I feel so exhausted like it's so exhausting.
[17895.24s -> 17899.24s]  You played a 44 minute gold game god damn that's impressive.
[17903.24s -> 17910.24s]  I don't want to honor any of these people who would you guys honor like out of all of them who'd you guys pick because I don't know they alsoin my eyes.
[17911.24s -> 17913.24s]  I'm too toxic right now they all suck.
[17916.24s -> 17917.24s]  Jax all right I'll give it to Jax.
[17920.24s -> 17923.24s]  Ash Ash was trying I'll give you that ash was trying.
[17926.24s -> 17932.24s]  Dude look at this Lux this Lux got so fucking carried oh my god.
[17932.24s -> 17944.24s]  Oh my god don't type to me you pedestrian.
[17948.24s -> 17950.24s]  This man called him a pedestrian.
[17950.24s -> 17972.24s]  That's not even an insult like oh yeah yeah wow fucking pedestrian like that's not even an insult man.
[17980.24s -> 18005.24s]  Dude guys I feel like part of my life gets taken away you know like when I play my main account and I'm like super sweaty tryharding and shitI feel like I feel like I'm losing like yeah it's like it's like every time I lose it's like one hair or like every time I'm like barely win right it's
[18005.24s -> 18012.24s]  just like every game in this he was like one hair on my head gets fucking burnt out and just leaves and I'm not gonna be like Homer Simpson.
[18012.24s -> 18040.24s]  Like look at the difference in wards place this is what annoys me about bad support players this guy plays 23.
[18041.24s -> 18045.24s]  He's more focused on getting kills than placing wards and it's really stupid.
[18051.24s -> 18062.24s]  Sorry I just don't listen I don't have anything against the dog lightning guy as a person other than like what I've seen on his stream right like on his stream he just seems really egotistical.
[18063.24s -> 18077.24s]  Like he's like everything I hate in the average league player he's he has a massive ego because he reached challenger on the support role on like an off meta pick like last year at some point or something or maybe he's challenger right now I don't even know.
[18078.24s -> 18089.24s]  Maybe he has an account in challenger I don't even know but it drives me crazy because like he doesn't do anything correctly like he gets away with such dumb shit.
[18089.24s -> 18106.24s]  Because he like he like basically wins lane because he plays extremely aggressively but if you guys noticed in that game the reason we won lane or we were able to push back is because they played aggressively but they did it really stupidly like they were fighting us in our own waves.
[18107.24s -> 18113.24s]  Right like on repeat they were just fighting us in our own waves every time I would just turn a one for one almost a one for two every time.
[18114.24s -> 18128.24s]  And it's it's stupid because every time that's happening they're also giving me souls right and he would like take weird fights and like I know he's probably for funding he doesn't care it's a smurf blah blah blah but I just don't like when people like that like ego their ass off when they play so badly.
[18129.24s -> 18130.24s]  It drives me crazy.
[18135.24s -> 18138.24s]  Why do I care so much I don't know I don't know.
[18143.24s -> 18144.24s]  I don't know.
[18159.24s -> 18160.24s]  How are you guys doing by the way.
[18161.24s -> 18164.24s]  How's everybody's day going in chat what you guys up to talk to me.
[18165.24s -> 18172.24s]  I know I stopped like teaching the game and started whining like I got on my main account a few hours ago and I stopped teaching and I started whining a bunch so.
[18174.24s -> 18175.24s]  My bad.
[18178.24s -> 18179.24s]  My bad on that one dudes.
[18180.24s -> 18181.24s]  How are you guys doing now.
[18181.24s -> 18182.24s]  How's everybody's day gone.
[18183.24s -> 18184.24s]  When the coaching service is open.
[18185.24s -> 18186.24s]  Oh I could probably do coaching.
[18187.24s -> 18188.24s]  At some point soon.
[18189.24s -> 18198.24s]  Like I'd be wanting to do some coaching some like sub coaching or something or like something like that.
[18199.24s -> 18200.24s]  It might be fun.
[18201.24s -> 18203.24s]  So I mean bronze you don't get enough time to actually improve.
[18203.24s -> 18204.24s]  Did I feel that man.
[18204.24s -> 18205.24s]  It takes a long time.
[18205.24s -> 18208.24s]  Well you guys not an easy game to pick up and start playing right.
[18209.24s -> 18214.24s]  Like if you're if you're in bronze or silver and you're like oh I actually you know I'm having fun playing the game I kind of want to try andget better.
[18214.24s -> 18218.24s]  It's you're just overwhelmed with so much info that you like have to play so many games.
[18218.24s -> 18219.24s]  Right.
[18219.24s -> 18220.24s]  I feel you man.
[18223.24s -> 18224.24s]  Like it's it's overwhelming.
[18230.24s -> 18231.24s]  Yeah I I feel you.
[18233.24s -> 18234.24s]  Yeah I I feel you.
[18236.24s -> 18237.24s]  I feel you.
[18238.24s -> 18239.24s]  I feel you.
[18240.24s -> 18241.24s]  I feel you.
[18242.24s -> 18243.24s]  I feel you.
[18244.24s -> 18245.24s]  I feel you.
[18246.24s -> 18247.24s]  I feel you.
[18249.24s -> 18250.24s]  I feel you.
[18252.24s -> 18253.24s]  I feel you.
[18256.24s -> 18257.24s]  Well we got mid.
[18257.24s -> 18258.24s]  Okay.
[18259.24s -> 18260.24s]  So I just play trust.
[18263.24s -> 18271.24s]  I'm worried if I picked trust that we won't have a P but I also think I'm better at trust than I am at like other stuff.
[18272.24s -> 18273.24s]  So I don't know.
[18279.24s -> 18280.24s]  AP Varus.
[18281.24s -> 18283.24s]  I'm not good enough at AP Varus man.
[18283.24s -> 18284.24s]  I'm gonna be real.
[18287.24s -> 18291.24s]  Well my mouse is good but the problem with Miles is like Miles is a shitty champion.
[18291.24s -> 18293.24s]  Like Miles is trash right so like.
[18295.24s -> 18306.24s]  He's good but he's like not good in the sense of like I can play him well but at the end of the day if they pick something that like countersmouse I just lose.
[18309.24s -> 18311.24s]  Or is like Tristana is just free to pick.
[18312.24s -> 18318.24s]  Like even if we play all AD right let's say we do all AD or some shit like on accidents or because people are one tricks blah blah blah.
[18319.24s -> 18326.24s]  It's it's still free like Tristana is still like a good pick because even with all AD she's still like you can build Lord Dom's.
[18327.24s -> 18331.24s]  She has incredibly high pressure early game if you play her right right like you could push the waves Rome.
[18332.24s -> 18337.24s]  You can you can roam top room bot help lanes out like level two three you can invade junglers early.
[18337.24s -> 18339.24s]  Like she's just incredibly incredibly strong.
[18341.24s -> 18342.24s]  This guy should go Pike.
[18343.24s -> 18349.24s]  I was gonna say they picked Nunu and I picked an AD mid they picked Nunu and Thresh.
[18350.24s -> 18357.24s]  We should have an engage because because Pike Trist like I can just walk bot on repeat now and pretty much kill people.
[18368.24s -> 18370.24s]  Watch an iron game watching an iron game.
[18371.24s -> 18372.24s]  I feel like it wouldn't be an actual iron game that would it.
[18376.24s -> 18379.24s]  I've heard I had friends who like intentionally lost a bunch of games.
[18382.24s -> 18388.24s]  And so they could get to iron four right they like they like into down to iron four whatever to see if they could make it and.
[18391.24s -> 18394.24s]  There's just so many like Smurfs in iron.
[18395.24s -> 18398.24s]  There's like legitimate bot bot accounts.
[18400.24s -> 18402.24s]  Like like accounts that are like being bodied.
[18403.24s -> 18406.24s]  Right there's like bought the counts and iron there's like Smurfs all over the place.
[18415.24s -> 18416.24s]  It seems to have stopped.
[18417.24s -> 18419.24s]  I wonder if Riot like did something that stopped the bots.
[18419.24s -> 18423.24s]  They must they may have like they may have just think incorporated something that like stops the software.
[18427.24s -> 18431.24s]  But I don't know I haven't heard anything about it but I have no clue.
[18432.24s -> 18433.24s]  I'll be real I don't know.
[18449.24s -> 18461.24s]  You had to take follow your last game I got boots one.
[18463.24s -> 18464.24s]  That sounds awful.
[18468.24s -> 18478.24s]  I kind of feel bad for actual iron players who are like in iron trying to climb because like that sounds bad.
[18479.24s -> 18498.24s]  I do think you can climb obviously out of any you know it doesn't matter right like if I were to go into an iron game I'd probably drop like 50 kills.
[18500.24s -> 18504.24s]  But I so I do think you can climb out of any you know any you know for sure.
[18509.24s -> 18523.24s]  You love on your new account if you guys got a bot account that answered every time I rub bot.
[18530.24s -> 18531.24s]  That's funny.
[18539.24s -> 18547.24s]  Yeah I assume that's a good point I guess if you're in iron you could like play to learn the game a bit better and then you could like play anew account and see where you got.
[18548.24s -> 18549.24s]  Yeah I know that would work.
[18550.24s -> 18551.24s]  That makes sense.
[18557.24s -> 18558.24s]  Sure I'll first pick man.
[18559.24s -> 18560.24s]  I'll first pick Senna.
[18561.24s -> 18569.24s]  I guarantee they walk in fucking these people are going to walk in fucking Nautilus or some shits.
[18570.24s -> 18572.24s]  They'll be like Jarvan Nautilus.
[18575.24s -> 18576.24s]  I don't even know.
[18582.24s -> 18587.24s]  Ribbon is not too bad for Senna so it's okay to get flanked I actually don't think Ribbon is too bad right now.
[18587.24s -> 18591.24s]  Maybe all the Ribbon players I played against suck but I don't think she's actually that bad.
[18592.24s -> 18594.24s]  I think Ribbon's like just you have to position well.
[18595.24s -> 18597.24s]  I think Ribbon's really broken at abusing positioning.
[18598.24s -> 18599.24s]  That's why she's so good it's all a Q.
[18600.24s -> 18605.24s]  Like good Ribbon players all get really gross flanks and the flanks are what's OP.
[18606.24s -> 18609.24s]  Yeah there's the Gragas okay I was like they're gonna play something to fuck me over.
[18611.24s -> 18614.24s]  This guy picked Gragas but it was gonna be like J4 or Gragas or something.
[18615.24s -> 18618.24s]  And then this guy is the support he'll probably pick Nautilus.
[18619.24s -> 18626.24s]  Unless he's a one trick right like unless this guy's straight up just like a one trick he'll pick like Nautilus or some shits.
[18629.24s -> 18631.24s]  Maybe Rakan, Rakan or Nautilus.
[18635.24s -> 18637.24s]  Because if he picks an Enchanter we just win the game.
[18641.24s -> 18643.24s]  He has to pick engage.
[18645.24s -> 18648.24s]  Mirio would be really good here too actually.
[18649.24s -> 18651.24s]  Because Mirio would counter half our team.
[18652.24s -> 18655.24s]  You can Mirio Q, Wukong and Kennen engage.
[18657.24s -> 18660.24s]  Like if this guy played Mirio this would actually be a hard land.
[18662.24s -> 18663.24s]  Tom Kinch?
[18667.24s -> 18669.24s]  I mean I get it but I think it's bad.
[18671.24s -> 18673.24s]  Runes? Oh shit.
[18675.24s -> 18678.24s]  Yo you just saved me looking like an absolute fool.
[18679.24s -> 18680.24s]  Thank you.
[18681.24s -> 18682.24s]  Holy crap.
[18682.24s -> 18684.24s]  If you wanted to see my runes they're here but thank you you reminded me.
[18684.24s -> 18686.24s]  Here I'm gonna be right here I'm gonna get some water.
[18686.24s -> 18687.24s]  I'll be right back.
[18687.24s -> 18688.24s]  Get some Agua.
[18704.24s -> 18705.24s]  I'm sorry.
[18728.24s -> 18731.24s]  By the way the people who are here to watch me play AD carry.
[18732.24s -> 18734.24s]  I sincerely apologize.
[18735.24s -> 18739.24s]  I know watching me play Senna is probably boring as fuck.
[18742.24s -> 18744.24s]  Okay I know.
[18745.24s -> 18748.24s]  And I promise you we will play AD carry at some point.
[18748.24s -> 18749.24s]  I promise you.
[18750.24s -> 18753.24s]  I played like the first four hours of the stream was AD carry or the first three.
[18753.24s -> 18755.24s]  Right I played on my smurf for a few games and played some AD.
[18755.24s -> 18757.24s]  So if you want to watch that you can go back in the bot.
[18757.24s -> 18759.24s]  We did some commentary and shit.
[18761.24s -> 18765.24s]  The only reason I'm playing so much Senna and support on this account is because like.
[18766.24s -> 18777.24s]  The elo I'm currently in is like the worst elo to climb in solo queue because of a lot of factors and support has some of the highest impact on the game.
[18779.24s -> 18788.24s]  Whereas like AD carry has high impact late but in solo queue you want to have high impact early and I wanted to be able to impact the game early on.
[18791.24s -> 18813.24s]  So yeah sorry about being you know boring and shit.
[18814.24s -> 18825.24s]  I just really want to like win games at least on this accounts.
[18825.24s -> 18830.24s]  I want to get out of the silo because the faster I get out of the silo the faster.
[18830.24s -> 18847.24s]  The faster I get out of the silo the faster I can have fun playing AD carry and like try and climb.
[18849.24s -> 18856.24s]  What a weird like what a weird play by these guys what the fuck they like half shoved the waves.
[18856.24s -> 18862.24s]  To get like early bush control and then they did shit like that.
[18872.24s -> 18874.24s]  This guy's just dead I'm gonna give it to twitch.
[18878.24s -> 18884.24s]  Nice we got as exhaust so I wasted my exhaust there I did it because I thought the jinx was gonna insta flash.
[18886.24s -> 18894.24s]  Like I didn't exhaust because I was like scared of her damage I did it because I thought she was gonna like try and flash away the second that's.
[18894.24s -> 18901.24s]  But I landed my snare it was kind of bad by me I mean I landed my snare so I didn't need to exhaust her I just was like oh maybe she'll flash.
[18901.24s -> 18905.24s]  She did not she did not flash.
[18905.24s -> 18909.24s]  What do you know is this 500 LP Masters 400 LP.
[18909.24s -> 18912.24s]  It's insane I know.
[18912.24s -> 18915.24s]  Absolutely crazy.
[18916.24s -> 18919.24s]  But I never be the same.
[18935.24s -> 18938.24s]  Put that word there because Gragas is probably bought.
[18938.24s -> 18941.24s]  So.
[18947.24s -> 18952.24s]  They're trying to come up from bot to kill me here.
[18952.24s -> 18956.24s]  Like their bot lane is rotating up to try and kill me.
[18956.24s -> 18958.24s]  So.
[18958.24s -> 18962.24s]  Just be careful twitch they're in here man.
[18962.24s -> 18966.24s]  I actually have to back and walk look.
[18967.24s -> 18975.24s]  This is hilarious the enemy bot lane literally is roaming mid.
[18975.24s -> 18977.24s]  Look at this.
[18977.24s -> 18980.24s]  What.
[18980.24s -> 18984.24s]  Why.
[18984.24s -> 18990.24s]  I'm not trying to soak his XP I just want those souls.
[18990.24s -> 18995.24s]  I'm scared to walk in here I don't know where Gragas is.
[18996.24s -> 19002.24s]  I don't want to be able to freeze here.
[19002.24s -> 19007.24s]  Even if Gragas ganks we win we win the fight right now.
[19007.24s -> 19015.24s]  Like it's an easy fight win as long as we don't get knocked up we just win the fight automatically.
[19015.24s -> 19020.24s]  I got to come bot to help my twitch so they don't freeze the wave.
[19020.24s -> 19024.48s]  Like it's an easy fight win as long as we don't get knocked up. We just win the fight automatically
[19032.32s -> 19035.12s]  Actually, we're trying to bait Gragas to come gank this
[19043.44s -> 19047.04s]  Easy double flashes baby easy
[19051.20s -> 19053.20s]  You fucking cowards
[19064.68s -> 19071.38s]  We should back up I can go by now. Oh, Greg is the top we could actually maybe do dragon
[19073.32s -> 19078.40s]  Yo, I'm gonna be real a soul roaming is not a not in like the top list of me being like nervous about it
[19080.64s -> 19082.64s]  Like I'm not nervous about a soul roaming man
[19086.12s -> 19088.68s]  Push this so we can oh we're diving them
[19089.72s -> 19093.32s]  That's a bit scary. Welcome to the league of Draven
[19094.12s -> 19099.32s]  Good to see you're back to enjoying the game. Whoa. We're going still diving that that's not good
[19100.04s -> 19102.04s]  Like we back off here, man. I
[19106.84s -> 19109.24s]  Mean we can maybe go up here if you really want to
[19110.24s -> 19112.24s]  I
[19115.20s -> 19117.20s]  Kind of award this
[19123.08s -> 19125.36s]  I need to reset though really badly right now
[19130.36s -> 19132.36s]  Really badly
[19133.16s -> 19135.52s]  Not being on the map here is really bad
[19136.88s -> 19138.88s]  Or rather not like having
[19139.24s -> 19142.24s]  Gold spent and being on the map is what I'm gonna say like it's really fucking bad
[19143.08s -> 19146.72s]  Yo back up, you know Gragas that you watched him walk past three wards
[19148.04s -> 19150.60s]  That's why I just warded. No, no, he's still here
[19151.48s -> 19153.48s]  Ragas is right there
[19154.24s -> 19158.16s]  Like we we know Gragas is somewhere bot lane right now. I don't know where but we know he's there
[19163.88s -> 19165.88s]  They're on dragon, okay
[19165.92s -> 19167.92s]  We can fight this go go go
[19168.36s -> 19170.36s]  W over I'm here
[19184.80s -> 19186.80s]  Nice yo, come here
[19188.12s -> 19193.64s]  Y'all help you come get this come get it mother's blue. I got you, baby
[19198.20s -> 19200.20s]  I
[19211.00s -> 19213.00s]  What the fuck
[19219.44s -> 19221.44s]  Made a bitch
[19222.04s -> 19224.04s]  Oh
[19227.40s -> 19229.40s]  I guess I'll back
[19230.12s -> 19234.52s]  Yo Spartan thank you for the six months man. Welcome back appreciate it
[19235.88s -> 19238.64s]  Yes, we'll back we'll get our fucking umbral
[19240.00s -> 19242.00s]  I'm gonna go top side of the map now
[19242.60s -> 19244.80s]  And I'm gonna help my team get ref taralds
[19245.56s -> 19248.48s]  I'm gonna ping I want to go top side. I want to help my team get refs
[19252.36s -> 19262.06s]  The wave if we look at bot wave it's pushing into us. It's totally fine. Okay, which is level six
[19263.56s -> 19267.56s]  The bot wave is pushing in we are totally fine to do what I'm doing right now
[19273.56s -> 19275.56s]  He doesn't know I'm here
[19282.04s -> 19284.04s]  I
[19285.68s -> 19287.68s]  Am dead though
[19293.24s -> 19295.24s]  Roa
[19296.76s -> 19299.00s]  No joke I almost juked that
[19300.28s -> 19305.48s]  That's so close. I was hoping like wukong for some reason didn't walk topside
[19306.68s -> 19308.68s]  But the enemy bot lane dead
[19311.88s -> 19319.52s]  Okay, the enemy bot lane just griefs their entire game the game's over we win what the fuck are they do what is happening?
[19321.92s -> 19323.92s]  Like my twitch is just getting free plates
[19329.88s -> 19331.88s]  Wait you guys are griefing
[19332.28s -> 19334.28s]  I
[19339.88s -> 19341.72s]  Am grieving
[19341.72s -> 19343.72s]  Dude, what the fuck?
[19343.88s -> 19348.76s]  We why would you fight them guys guys guys wukong?
[19350.24s -> 19351.40s]  Wukong
[19351.40s -> 19356.96s]  Okay, we see that our twitch is getting free plates bot free first turret. Okay. I'm back
[19356.96s -> 19363.72s]  I almost soloed their ad carry. Okay, or their jungler. Why would you ever on purpose?
[19364.28s -> 19369.12s]  Take a for a fight like that with no. Oh, I have cancer. I
[19370.28s -> 19371.40s]  also
[19371.40s -> 19376.04s]  The wukong's an idiot. He doesn't understand macro at all apparently because I literally
[19376.68s -> 19380.12s]  Pings to come to rift my wukong was like nervous
[19380.72s -> 19389.08s]  Like for some reason wukong didn't walk top he sat bot trying to gank but the objective was rift not
[19391.32s -> 19394.76s]  God I'm losing my mind in the silo masters players are
[19395.60s -> 19398.76s]  Literally just diamond players with slightly better mechanics
[19398.76s -> 19403.00s]  They don't know anything about the game and I'm about to my brains about to explode like a peanut
[19405.16s -> 19408.76s]  It's not about them laning 2v2 you fucking cumquat
[19410.16s -> 19413.92s]  Dude, I know they can't lane against us 2v2. It's not about the 2v2 man
[19414.08s -> 19418.84s]  We we get a free reft herald because we shut down their bot lane and I'm on an item spike
[19419.00s -> 19423.04s]  So we just automatically get a free rift. It has nothing to do with 2v2
[19426.44s -> 19428.44s]  This cumquat motherfucker
[19433.36s -> 19437.04s]  I don't know why that's my insult the pedestrian guy got to me
[19437.04s -> 19439.04s]  somehow
[19447.32s -> 19449.32s]  Where the fuck is this war
[19455.80s -> 19460.88s]  Cuz I'm telling you right now my macro there was a hundred percent correct by the way like 1000%
[19467.64s -> 19469.64s]  I
[19471.32s -> 19475.48s]  Even though I died I know it was correct. No, no just do dragon do not dive
[19476.40s -> 19479.84s]  Guys we don't have to not everything's about kills not everything's about kills. We got this
[19481.04s -> 19483.08s]  Like you don't need to dive you don't need to dive always
[19483.08s -> 19490.08s]  You don't need to see a kill be like ooh monkey kill brain go like the game is about like getting objectives on timers and
[19490.32s -> 19493.32s]  Playing off of tempo and things like that like
[19493.64s -> 19498.28s]  The only reason we even lost rift was because my wukong went full monkey brand and was like no
[19498.28s -> 19502.00s]  We need to not play for this rift with a giant massive lead
[19502.00s -> 19523.24s]  Wait kill this guy
[19528.32s -> 19530.32s]  What am I watching right now
[19532.00s -> 19538.80s]  This is outrageous my wukong just solo ulted there dude. I'm gonna lose it my wukong just solo ulted their Gragas
[19549.40s -> 19551.40s]  On a good note though
[19551.92s -> 19554.76s]  They don't get any plates off of rifting so it's not that bad
[19556.52s -> 19559.44s]  Okay, man, just push like dude hit the minions like stop
[19562.00s -> 19563.84s]  My bad
[19563.84s -> 19570.40s]  Sorry, I'm wound up right now cannon. Okay. I'm gonna want apologies if I if I grieve two men
[19572.48s -> 19574.48s]  It's fine
[19574.56s -> 19576.56s]  So it'll wound up it's fine
[19576.96s -> 19581.84s]  I just don't like when like stuff like that happens. I'm a perfectionist and it's my big place
[19581.84s -> 19586.00s]  I talk about this earlier. I'm a perfectionist my biggest flaw is that like I will
[19587.28s -> 19591.60s]  Play the game 100% correctly on like tempo and timers, but you can't do that
[19592.08s -> 19594.88s]  Because you got to remember to like your teammates or teammates
[19598.56s -> 19601.92s]  Like they're not just gonna instantly know exactly what you're what what to do
[19613.28s -> 19619.28s]  We win the guy don't just stand here and watch me die man. Holy shit
[19622.96s -> 19631.68s]  That is oh my god, if he if he had let me die there. I might have screamed actually screamed out loud in anger
[19634.96s -> 19638.40s]  Like dude is watching me kite these people within one inch of my life
[19639.44s -> 19642.64s]  And instead of like helping or walking up and doing anything. You know what he does
[19645.12s -> 19647.12s]  He pulls a fucking gross score
[19647.12s -> 19654.96s]  My man just likes to watch something wrong with it, but you know, there's a time and a place
[19671.92s -> 19674.64s]  I don't actually want to buy pinks because I don't think we're strong enough that uh
[19675.60s -> 19679.04s]  I don't think that we're strong enough that I can actually even defend the pinks right now if I'm being honest like
[19680.08s -> 19684.00s]  We should be strong enough, but we kind of throw a lead when I overforced the rift
[19684.72s -> 19686.72s]  So I think
[19691.36s -> 19693.36s]  I think
[19696.56s -> 19700.24s]  We need to push this wave so that we can get tempo and move around the map
[19700.88s -> 19702.32s]  prior
[19702.32s -> 19704.32s]  Sorry, I keep saying the wrong thing
[19705.60s -> 19707.60s]  Oh
[19710.08s -> 19712.16s]  That guy's dead. I I have to ditch that guy
[19713.52s -> 19715.52s]  He's dead as fuck. Oh, I'm dead too. Maybe oh
[19716.56s -> 19718.56s]  I am so dead
[19718.56s -> 19720.56s]  Yeah, that was my bad
[19720.56s -> 19724.80s]  That was my bad my bad my bad like I we just got we just got ran down. That was on me
[19727.92s -> 19734.32s]  Like we we had good positioning, but um the jungler wasn't uh close enough. So this is my bad
[19735.60s -> 19740.32s]  I also didn't expect to get fucking four man's but I should have right
[19743.12s -> 19747.52s]  We should play for this though. I wish I could type. I wish I wasn't chat restricted for a year
[19749.36s -> 19751.84s]  Dude, I swear to god. I'm not even being mean
[19752.88s -> 19756.56s]  Like riot was like they chat restricted me because I type so much macro
[19757.12s -> 19759.78s]  That it gets on people's nerves and they don't want me spam typing
[19765.20s -> 19767.84s]  Low key don't play don't play for refs
[19778.88s -> 19784.08s]  I need help guys if you guys can help we need the clear vision on dragon
[19794.80s -> 19800.56s]  A year yeah, I I get uncharted april 15th or april 11th or some shit
[19801.44s -> 19803.44s]  2024
[19804.40s -> 19805.84s]  I've never seen it
[19805.84s -> 19808.32s]  It must have been like an actual riot or something
[19808.80s -> 19812.08s]  Like I've never seen an automated system give you a year chat restricts, right?
[19812.72s -> 19815.04s]  So in my mind, it's got to be like an actual like
[19817.84s -> 19819.84s]  Like a rioter was like dronimo
[19820.88s -> 19823.28s]  We know you're good enough to climb but stop typing
[19824.96s -> 19826.96s]  You know, I mean that's like what must have been going on
[19833.28s -> 19836.00s]  And I'm like, okay, well sure
[19852.00s -> 19854.00s]  I mean, I didn't know you could get chat band a year
[19854.72s -> 19857.36s]  What's weird is like I I said, I don't I don't like say trigger words
[19857.36s -> 19859.60s]  It's not like I tell people to like end themselves and stuff
[19860.32s -> 19862.32s]  It's mainly just me typing like
[19862.32s -> 19865.04s]  Go here do that do this like I type a lot, right?
[19865.52s -> 19869.04s]  Which is obviously like if you type a lot it can be toxic as well. So
[19873.04s -> 19875.04s]  Like typing a lot's annoying so I get it
[19885.36s -> 19889.44s]  We should be playing for baron side vision right now not
[19890.72s -> 19893.44s]  The vision we're playing with right now is bad. We should be playing over here
[19895.36s -> 19899.28s]  Like I want to play for baron vision, but it's a little hard to do that right now
[19904.56s -> 19908.00s]  Because you see how tom kenshin me are like transferring vision control around the map right now
[19908.64s -> 19912.08s]  We're playing this little support game of like hide the vision
[19913.04s -> 19916.56s]  Okay, look at this fuck look at this motherfucker
[19931.28s -> 19933.28s]  Oh, he's so dumb
[19934.16s -> 19936.16s]  I
[19941.92s -> 19943.92s]  Still think he's dumb
[19951.92s -> 19953.92s]  How did I just take
[19958.80s -> 19962.32s]  Tonight I took my entire HP bar in a global
[19963.76s -> 19968.48s]  My bad, dude, I really wish the mouth fight would group though
[19969.92s -> 19973.28s]  I get that he's like doing the thing where he's like, oh, let's you know split
[19973.84s -> 19976.00s]  Like his play was actually really smart there
[19976.80s -> 19978.40s]  The mouth fights play I mean
[19978.40s -> 19980.64s]  Like that wasn't his fault that we got shit on at all
[19981.20s -> 19985.52s]  I just wish that he would group because if he groups up and hits are we win every team fight
[19986.48s -> 19989.20s]  Because right now our only frontliner is the wukong, right?
[19989.60s -> 19993.12s]  And the fact that wukong's our frontliner we don't have the ability to play the game
[19994.24s -> 19996.80s]  When I get stuck on that what the fuck was that?
[19998.24s -> 20002.64s]  Like that tom kensh getting to e forward like that blindly into our entire team
[20003.28s -> 20007.20s]  And then not getting punished for it might be the most like solo queue thing I've ever seen
[20007.92s -> 20009.92s]  Nobody wanted to hit him because he was the tank
[20010.48s -> 20012.64s]  but uh
[20012.64s -> 20015.04s]  Yeah, that's we should still kill him, you know
[20015.04s -> 20024.16s]  We can fight this guy. Oh my god jungler just come
[20025.60s -> 20028.16s]  Oh, we're forfeiting. Oh, okay. Now that makes perfect sense, right?
[20030.48s -> 20032.08s]  Just come group
[20032.08s -> 20034.64s]  Bro, cannon come group. Please guys
[20035.44s -> 20038.88s]  Like I don't know why everybody's frustrated. We're literally still up in gold
[20039.92s -> 20041.92s]  Please come group up. We just took an inhibitor
[20042.88s -> 20044.88s]  Just just come group
[20045.92s -> 20048.80s]  Help me get vision on this dragon so that I don't so we don't die
[20049.76s -> 20052.72s]  Like I need my team to actually walk over here to help me get vision
[20055.28s -> 20059.76s]  It's really frustrating because I need the frontliners the wukong in the mouth fight to walk in with me
[20060.64s -> 20064.40s]  Because I'm I'm a little fucking why I have a big gun, but I'm a big gun girl, right?
[20064.88s -> 20068.88s]  So I need I need these two guys to walk in with me these two big burly mountain men
[20072.24s -> 20079.68s]  So that I can play the game, you know, no, we don't push bot no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[20080.16s -> 20081.20s]  man
[20081.20s -> 20083.20s]  No bot is worthless come in
[20083.60s -> 20085.60s]  My mouth fight's pushing the wave that we already have down
[20086.40s -> 20088.40s]  I wish I could macro
[20088.48s -> 20092.16s]  I wish I could type some macro right now. They're they're like my team is so lost
[20094.96s -> 20096.96s]  They're so beyond lost right now. It's crazy
[20099.12s -> 20101.12s]  They're lost this shit
[20102.80s -> 20104.80s]  I don't carry this
[20105.60s -> 20107.60s]  to compromise
[20108.88s -> 20112.08s]  Just do two dragon. Yes, just do this. Just do I'll start it for you. Here you go
[20113.12s -> 20116.88s]  I don't know why we're standing in a bush waiting for them to face check do dragon guys
[20121.84s -> 20126.24s]  I'm I swear to god you have to do everything in the zero where you have to start every fight
[20126.72s -> 20128.72s]  I have to basically I have to start every fight
[20129.44s -> 20133.76s]  Right, I have to not only start every fight, but I have to like ping my team what to do exactly
[20134.40s -> 20136.80s]  Because everybody plays so safe in this elo
[20137.60s -> 20139.76s]  Why did my mouth fight just stop his back?
[20141.76s -> 20143.76s]  Why are you all fighting?
[20147.52s -> 20149.52s]  Oh my god, please guys
[20152.88s -> 20154.88s]  It's fine it's fine fine
[20155.36s -> 20158.16s]  No mouth fight you can't 1v9 that just back off
[20158.72s -> 20162.64s]  They didn't get anything. They didn't get anything. We got dragon. We're on dragon soul points
[20164.72s -> 20171.20s]  I'm losing hairs. I'm losing fucking hairs man. I ain't got many hairs to spare anymore. We're out here losing hair
[20177.36s -> 20180.64s]  It's like I'm babysitting like this has got to be what a preschool teacher feels like, you know
[20181.52s -> 20186.00s]  Like low-key like preschool teacher just feels feels like this. This has to be it
[20189.12s -> 20191.12s]  Like
[20191.44s -> 20196.96s]  Like watching it's like watching a toddler like you watch them from the corner, right and they're like eating glue and you're like
[20198.00s -> 20200.00s]  I mean, that's bad and then you tell them like don't eat glue
[20200.32s -> 20202.16s]  Don't eat glue timmy and he's like, okay
[20202.64s -> 20206.24s]  And then like you leave him there for five minutes to go like do something to watch somebody else
[20206.48s -> 20208.88s]  Then all of a sudden timmy's eating glue again, and you're like bro
[20210.16s -> 20213.20s]  Bro, we just had this discussion
[20219.68s -> 20222.56s]  And it's like not timmy's fault, right because he's a toddler
[20223.52s -> 20229.68s]  So you can't be mad at timmy because he's a toddler you can't but it's like it's frustrating. It's like god damn it man
[20241.12s -> 20246.32s]  Like what is what is happening like mouth fight just group my mouth fight has a fetish with just pushing bot
[20247.28s -> 20249.28s]  Bro just group and hit R
[20250.48s -> 20254.48s]  Bro, I know you have Bork. Wait, you have Bork?

[20263.52s -> 20265.52s]  Just group up hit our and we win
[20266.48s -> 20269.44s]  Like I've been controlling the ever-living fuck out of all the vision this game
[20270.08s -> 20274.56s]  I feel like I'm doing all of this to control vision and shit and it still feels like it's not enough
[20275.52s -> 20277.52s]  It's kind of nuts
[20279.92s -> 20282.56s]  Okay, it still feels not enough
[20288.56s -> 20292.24s]  No, don't go by don't go by don't go by don't go by please don't go by
[20293.60s -> 20295.60s]  Hit me

[20529.04s -> 20533.44s]  Like I feel like every like I feel like what Walter white felt like dealing with
[20533.44s -> 20536.88s]  Skyler for literally three years like this is outrageous
[20537.68s -> 20542.40s]  This is what this feels like like I I can relate to the show so much more
[20544.32s -> 20546.32s]  Oh my god
[20547.52s -> 20549.52s]  Like dude, I
[20559.52s -> 20561.52s]  Oh
[20563.44s -> 20565.44s]  Oh
[20576.40s -> 20582.72s]  Crap, dude, look at just look at the like look at like what's going on in the game
[20583.28s -> 20593.60s]  Like I I don't even mean to be mean about this. It's just this is this is crazy
[20597.04s -> 20599.04s]  Malfight though popping off
[20599.60s -> 20601.60s]  Malfight popping off
[20609.84s -> 20611.84s]  Like what are you I was this guy
[20613.60s -> 20615.60s]  Oh, he's literally diamond
[20619.76s -> 20622.48s]  Why is this guy in this game? I mean I feel I feel like
[20623.20s -> 20626.88s]  Confused now. I'm not even blaming the wukong anymore. I don't know why this guy is in the game
[20628.16s -> 20630.64s]  Oh, he has inflated that's m mr
[20634.80s -> 20637.44s]  Oh, he just has previous season inflated the m mr
[20638.08s -> 20640.96s]  That's what the sense because he was gm for three years
[20641.92s -> 20647.92s]  So the his m mr says that he like belongs here even though he doesn't play like I bet you last season he only played like 50 games
[20650.56s -> 20655.60s]  I can look right we just see like how many games he played. Yeah, he played. He played like 50 games last season
[20656.56s -> 20659.44s]  So like his m mr. Didn't really change. He just got masters and then stopped
[20660.96s -> 20662.96s]  Which is fine. There's nothing wrong with that
[20663.28s -> 20665.28s]  I
[20670.88s -> 20672.88s]  Just wish he would chill, you know
[20673.92s -> 20676.88s]  Like like uh, not rage quit halfway through the game
[20679.44s -> 20682.56s]  Because like I said people's elo and shit used to bother me a lot
[20682.56s -> 20684.88s]  I don't I don't get bothered by anymore because I realized it was cringe
[20685.36s -> 20688.96s]  I don't care about their elo and shit. What what I care about is like I just want them to play the game
[20689.04s -> 20689.84s]  You know what I mean
[20689.92s -> 20694.96s]  Like I just want them to not rage not not like be absolute apes in the game and just play that's all I ask for
[20695.76s -> 20698.96s]  I don't care if you're a diamond player a plot player in the game and you're just like accidentally in the game
[20698.96s -> 20701.20s]  It's not your fault. I just want you to push buttons
[20705.52s -> 20707.52s]  What I'm doing wrong to have a 36 one rate
[20711.20s -> 20714.64s]  Uh, I can't see the link because just you'd have to give me your name and your server
[20714.64s -> 20721.84s]  How you guys doing by the way everybody having a good day you guys enjoying the stream having a good time
[20722.80s -> 20729.36s]  Watching me go bald in live like live time. You guys are like, oh look Drona was going bald live on stream and I'm like, yeah
[20731.20s -> 20733.76s]  It's rough. Hold on. I'm gonna take my pants off
[20744.64s -> 20746.64s]  You
[20746.64s -> 20748.64s]  You
[20773.68s -> 20776.32s]  Dude what I fuck you guys
[20777.60s -> 20783.28s]  They fucking like I get double swapped. Did you guys see that shit? They're like, oh, yeah, the support could do it and then he banned Santa
[20784.64s -> 20786.64s]  I mean, I didn't hover it. So that's my bad
[20787.52s -> 20790.96s]  God damn it. I should have hovered. I was just like taking my pants off
[20793.92s -> 20795.92s]  And now he wants first pick
[20797.92s -> 20799.92s]  Dude what?
[20800.80s -> 20804.08s]  Oh my god, I hate I don't I don't know. I don't know what to say. This is crazy
[20806.72s -> 20814.32s]  Today's Thursday, right? I am I losing days today's Thursday, right guys?
[20823.20s -> 20825.20s]  It is okay cool
[20825.92s -> 20828.64s]  Uh, what do I play they have Zerath and the zen
[20830.32s -> 20833.36s]  If Zaya, I mean, I guess I could just play recon. It's not big deal
[20837.36s -> 20845.20s]  Let's see what their balling is though. I actually have to see what their balling is to choose my runes
[20848.80s -> 20855.52s]  So no, no, oh they have an Israel the fuck is their team comp, um
[20858.32s -> 20860.32s]  Okay
[20866.96s -> 20868.96s]  You
[20879.76s -> 20883.36s]  When you do this build, what's the secondary supposed to be I think it's supposed to be this
[20887.68s -> 20892.00s]  Or maybe like revitalize I just feel like unflinching so good
[20892.40s -> 20894.40s]  Oh
[20895.12s -> 20897.12s]  They have a support
[20897.36s -> 20899.84s]  Zerath so supports that yeah, yeah, okay, so I want uh
[20901.04s -> 20903.36s]  I definitely want glacial here and I want
[20905.44s -> 20909.36s]  Maybe I take mr actually instead of armor because they have two poke champs
[20910.96s -> 20913.68s]  And I take this. Yeah. Yeah, this is good. Okay
[20916.88s -> 20920.32s]  That's not bad. Okay one sec. I'll be ready. I need to get some more water
[20922.00s -> 20924.96s]  You
[20952.00s -> 20954.00s]  Oh
[20966.00s -> 20968.00s]  Welcome to
[20976.00s -> 20978.00s]  30 seconds until minion spawn
[20982.96s -> 20984.96s]  Burn
[20987.84s -> 20989.84s]  Oh shit, no, don't flag me
[20991.20s -> 20995.76s]  Fuck man, I had to pee don't fucking flag me for afk because I didn't take a week
[20998.24s -> 21002.24s]  Can you not start with ad carry to move over to support I always fall asleep before the ad carry gameplay
[21003.44s -> 21007.28s]  Wait, what I fell asleep before ad carry. What do you mean?
[21007.92s -> 21011.28s]  Oh, you mean like start with my main and then play
[21014.16s -> 21016.16s]  Yeah, I played ad carry at the start
[21026.24s -> 21031.76s]  I should probably play ad carry more over support
[21034.00s -> 21035.60s]  Later in the stream
[21035.68s -> 21038.72s]  Here I'll play an ad carry game after this. I feel bad
[21056.96s -> 21059.76s]  Oh, it's gragas. I thought it was gonna be zara, but it's gragas
[21060.32s -> 21062.32s]  I
[21064.00s -> 21068.40s]  Don't want to fight too hard level one even though that guy I should have gone in there. That was my bad
[21069.20s -> 21072.72s]  I want to I want to try and get level two here. Even though I think we actually win level one
[21075.92s -> 21079.52s]  Oh, I got his bone plating. Yeah, I should have fought level one. That was my bad
[21080.72s -> 21083.04s]  Because we went very hard level one. I just griefed it
[21084.48s -> 21088.72s]  Like all I have to do there is go in on the ezreal or the gragas level one and they can't play the game
[21090.40s -> 21092.40s]  Right
[21107.60s -> 21113.20s]  It's not worth it's not worth there's no way that I can not get eed by gragas there by the way
[21115.60s -> 21118.00s]  Like I don't know if I can flash w there
[21119.76s -> 21121.76s]  No
[21129.28s -> 21131.28s]  Maybe we shouldn't be egoing buddy
[21136.00s -> 21139.36s]  This guy's just fucking egos in front of me like what
[21150.72s -> 21155.28s]  Okay, I might have missed everything there, but like
[21157.60s -> 21159.60s]  You know, it's okay
[21171.84s -> 21173.84s]  It's a little counterproductive
[21175.52s -> 21178.00s]  When I take a tower shot to land a Q
[21179.76s -> 21181.76s]  Feels a little counterproductive
[21189.04s -> 21191.04s]  But hey
[21194.24s -> 21199.20s]  I'm gonna back here just in case the enemy zin tries to gank him in
[21202.00s -> 21204.00s]  Dude, I'm so sad. I can't get boots
[21204.72s -> 21206.72s]  I
[21209.68s -> 21212.16s]  I'm gonna wait. Yeah, I'm gonna be cringe. I'm gonna wait
[21213.28s -> 21217.28s]  I would never wait here normally, but you know what it's just it's so like it's such a big buy
[21219.04s -> 21221.04s]  I don't want to I'm I'm off
[21221.76s -> 21224.72s]  Now that now that I've waited and beat cringe now I have to sit here and wait
[21225.36s -> 21229.44s]  Oh, it's so painful. Okay. I'm on my way. I'm sorry guys
[21234.64s -> 21236.64s]  I
[21247.68s -> 21249.68s]  Worked the way it not not at all
[21253.12s -> 21255.12s]  I got lucky, but
[21264.08s -> 21269.84s]  You know what's interesting I'd never use the stupid dematerializer
[21270.40s -> 21274.56s]  I feel like I should have like I should use it on every cannon or some shit, but I just don't do it
[21275.36s -> 21278.16s]  Because I know the reason you're supposed to use it is because it helps you push
[21279.04s -> 21281.60s]  Because you can dematerialize the cannon right and just instead. Yeah
[21282.64s -> 21285.44s]  So you're supposed to use it because it's like a really fast way to push but it's also a
[21294.24s -> 21296.24s]  So
[21303.04s -> 21310.16s]  I should not have wed. Fuck. I won't not the Gragas. Anyway, I fucked up. I shouldn't have wed the Gragas. I should play it slower
[21312.96s -> 21314.96s]  This guy's gonna die
[21316.48s -> 21319.36s]  Oh, he's gonna die you put himself against the wall gg
[21319.52s -> 21321.52s]  I
[21321.92s -> 21323.92s]  That was my fault though 100%
[21328.16s -> 21333.04s]  Because if I didn't w in they can't kill us right and Gragas probably dies to the auto attack anyway
[21333.52s -> 21336.48s]  My thought process was Gragas snared. So if I w here
[21337.12s -> 21341.06s]  But even after like even if I don't get e'd I'm pretty confident I die
[21349.36s -> 21351.36s]  I
[21351.36s -> 21353.36s]  I
[21353.36s -> 21355.36s]  I
[21355.36s -> 21357.36s]  I
[21377.60s -> 21379.60s]  Damn it, I tried I was out of everything
[21382.64s -> 21384.64s]  Damn
[21385.60s -> 21391.44s]  I wonder if I could have played that better. Maybe like if I could have weaved an extra auto in or something
[21392.72s -> 21394.72s]  I don't know
[21394.96s -> 21396.96s]  It's hard to know
[21412.40s -> 21414.40s]  All right, I'm gonna go mid here
[21415.36s -> 21417.36s]  I can't okay
[21418.88s -> 21422.40s]  Well, I could go mid but I think I I think I want to sit bot for a bit and get some xp
[21424.80s -> 21426.80s]  I think it's smarter to do that at this point
[21429.92s -> 21431.92s]  I think we should push this
[21445.76s -> 21454.00s]  I don't want to w in because I know Zen's area. That's why I didn't want to w because I know Zen's here
[21468.24s -> 21471.28s]  They were just making it so obvious right like that it was like
[21472.24s -> 21477.04s]  Sometimes when people make shit too good to be true it is too good to be true
[21478.32s -> 21481.36s]  Yeah, like oh shit. We're just gonna they're just gonna fight us here cool
[21483.44s -> 21485.44s]  Oh, yeah, I gotta help him push my bad
[21488.72s -> 21490.72s]  I'm playing sloppy
[21501.52s -> 21503.52s]  You
[21515.76s -> 21517.76s]  You guys want to see a cool trick watch this
[21521.36s -> 21526.40s]  She could push the wave and then just min max the back. Yeah, how cool was that?
[21526.40s -> 21534.40s]  She just pushes the wave and I just back next to the bush and she's just like oh, I guess I'll take the free ride
[21547.92s -> 21550.64s]  I really need level six badly
[21556.48s -> 21558.48s]  I
[21562.56s -> 21567.84s]  Like bro, I really cannot get level six right now. This is painful
[21573.44s -> 21575.92s]  Okay, kill these maybe I'm six off this. Nope. Guess not
[21577.20s -> 21580.32s]  I was gonna stay mid there by the way and help the homie
[21581.76s -> 21583.76s]  I need to go mid
[21587.36s -> 21589.36s]  I'm going
[21602.16s -> 21605.28s]  How long do we fight until we are free until
[21612.64s -> 21614.64s]  This is so awkward
[21616.56s -> 21618.56s]  I
[21628.08s -> 21630.08s]  Bro help me
[21635.92s -> 21641.20s]  Bro like you gotta walk to me like I can't like my eve is like here
[21641.84s -> 21643.84s]  I'm way over here
[21644.64s -> 21647.04s]  Right in my eaves like yo homie
[21649.84s -> 21656.08s]  Like dude, I'm like we're trying to push the wave in for her and she's just not accepting to wait
[21659.44s -> 21660.80s]  And I can't w the wall
[21660.80s -> 21664.16s]  I mean I guess I could w the wall because I was trying to walk around right
[21664.24s -> 21668.72s]  I saw her in trouble when I was here. So I wanted her to walk towards here so I could e over the wall
[21669.68s -> 21676.88s]  That was my thought process e over the wall helped the guy, but he like didn't understand that and I just got shit on and it felt really bad
[21682.00s -> 21684.08s]  Both our solos are getting absolutely shit on
[21686.48s -> 21691.76s]  This is very bad because I don't know how to help our team at this stage
[21691.76s -> 21699.36s]  Like I'm just always behind on tempo now around the map in the wrong spot at the wrong time
[21721.92s -> 21723.92s]  This is so awkward
[21726.08s -> 21728.08s]  I have ult we could kill this guy
[21732.16s -> 21734.16s]  I guess not
[21734.96s -> 21738.16s]  Um we could maybe kill the zen if I sneak in here
[21752.16s -> 21759.52s]  Push the wave push the wave hurry he's got to crash it
[21775.68s -> 21777.68s]  I mean this guy's just dead
[21778.56s -> 21786.48s]  My adc is gonna get fucked for it though. So I hope it was worth like my adc is gonna get zoned
[21793.60s -> 21796.88s]  It's really hard to tell if anything like that's worth sometimes because
[21798.80s -> 21803.52s]  I used my ult before a dragon fight. We're gonna lose bot tower. There's just so many factors, right? It's so hard
[21804.24s -> 21806.40s]  And now I don't have words. Oh, it's so rough
[21808.00s -> 21810.00s]  I
[21825.92s -> 21828.48s]  Got the ignite off, but dude, I can't believe that Gragas lived
[21829.36s -> 21831.36s]  No, oh, I had stopwatch
[21832.08s -> 21836.40s]  I have stopwatch. Oh my god. I'm the worst player in existence
[21837.28s -> 21841.36s]  I actually have the ability just to live there. Oh, no
[21844.32s -> 21847.60s]  I should sell my magi's and shame
[21849.12s -> 21851.12s]  I actually just want the item. So
[21852.88s -> 21854.88s]  Dude, I'm so bad
[21855.68s -> 21859.76s]  Dude, Gragas is low. He a good pick versus rakan though. You can stop his engage so easily
[21867.12s -> 21870.00s]  I don't want a world that it's actually low key a good pick
[21887.36s -> 21889.36s]  Magic is supposed to
[21896.64s -> 21898.64s]  Bro
[21922.08s -> 21924.08s]  Nice not bad
[21926.64s -> 21928.64s]  I
[21934.16s -> 21936.16s]  Kind of want to back off here
[21938.24s -> 21945.36s]  You know what feels kind of bad you guys notice that I just I got my uh, I don't know if you guys notice this but I got my fucking
[21949.12s -> 21952.08s]  I got like four assists just now, but it was after
[21953.04s -> 21956.88s]  I sold my magi's how fucking bad does that feel?
[21958.24s -> 21960.24s]  Like actually
[21964.00s -> 21966.48s]  Oh, by the way, uh, I wanted to ask you guys
[21968.72s -> 21974.00s]  What ad carry do you guys think is the most sought out for people to learn right now?
[21976.72s -> 21981.60s]  Like what what would you say is like people want to learn this ad carry over other ad carries
[21982.32s -> 21984.32s]  What do you guys think?
[21984.56s -> 21986.56s]  My man says timmo. Okay
[21986.80s -> 21988.80s]  Make sense
[21988.80s -> 21990.80s]  Got it
[21997.60s -> 22000.40s]  Depends. Yeah, I'm just trying to wonder like what um
[22002.24s -> 22005.28s]  People would want to watch or what people would want to learn
[22005.84s -> 22009.84s]  Specifically because I know everybody plays different shit, but I know there's also like popular shit, you know
[22012.96s -> 22020.32s]  Okay, I'm just bad. He's bad too. We listen. We're we're bad
[22023.76s -> 22025.76s]  We're bad guys
[22042.08s -> 22044.08s]  Oh
[22069.20s -> 22071.20s]  Not bad
[22072.24s -> 22074.24s]  Jin lucian's iath elios
[22074.48s -> 22078.00s]  Damn, is it like just that different like a lot of people like different stuff
[22080.08s -> 22082.56s]  Because I've always just thought like oh no
[22090.48s -> 22092.88s]  I guess I've always just thought that people like um
[22095.92s -> 22099.76s]  A lot of people really like like meta ad carries or like really play makey ad carries, right?
[22100.16s -> 22106.72s]  Like jinx is probably the best ad carry in the meta, but I don't see a lot of people ever ask or like request to watch jinx
[22107.44s -> 22108.00s]  You know what I mean?
[22108.00s -> 22111.60s]  Like jinx is not like she's not like a fun ad carry that people want to learn how to play
[22112.00s -> 22114.00s]  Even though she is like the best ad
[22114.24s -> 22116.48s]  There's like the people who are like, oh, yeah, no jinx is boring
[22116.56s -> 22119.60s]  Like I want to play jinn and like shoot people. I want to play like lucian and dash around
[22119.84s -> 22121.92s]  Like it's like so that's what I'm wondering is like what the number one
[22122.24s -> 22124.56s]  Ad carry is for like people just like enjoy watching
[22130.00s -> 22144.00s]  Not bad though. Okay. I think we could play an ad carry game. I'm down
[22147.12s -> 22149.12s]  I owe you guys an ad carry game
[22149.68s -> 22152.24s]  I owe you that much for watching me play support for two hours
[22152.80s -> 22154.80s]  Actually, I think it was like two and a half hours
[22157.04s -> 22159.28s]  Uh, yeah, we played four games to support so it was like two hours
[22160.72s -> 22162.88s]  Yeah, I owe you guys for for that
[22169.20s -> 22174.88s]  Ziya or vain Ziya is fun to watch I do like Ziya you love jinx and kate. Oh, there you go
[22181.60s -> 22184.00s]  You're playing support top so you like to watch how ad carries play it
[22186.64s -> 22189.36s]  So that you can like better help the homies got it got it
[22190.56s -> 22192.56s]  You
[22202.16s -> 22207.28s]  We need eight wins I think from this point we are right now. I think it's eight wins to get to grandmaster
[22208.40s -> 22210.40s]  I think oops
[22213.44s -> 22217.28s]  Because we're what 370 something right like three set 360
[22218.24s -> 22221.68s]  No, we just won we're not 360 we're like 370
[22223.28s -> 22228.16s]  We're 387. Okay, so we're it's not updated, but what is this stop?
[22231.68s -> 22235.84s]  So we need what seven wins net wins to get to GM
[22236.64s -> 22238.64s]  I think we can hit GM
[22238.64s -> 22244.48s]  I'm a little I'm a little less confident right now about master or about challenger, but I think we can definitely hit GM
[22245.20s -> 22247.60s]  Like I think I'll get stuck in GM for a bit
[22248.56s -> 22250.56s]  unless
[22252.56s -> 22254.56s]  Unless
[22255.44s -> 22258.88s]  The games get higher quality. I'll be stuck in GM for a little bit
[22264.00s -> 22267.44s]  Because the thing about the thing about the games so far is like
[22268.08s -> 22273.52s]  The higher quality the games get the easier it actually is to carry if like if you're a decent player
[22274.48s -> 22279.92s]  Because the better your teammates get which means that like if you're at that like say like a challenger player
[22279.92s -> 22284.08s]  We'll have a better time a challenger ad carry player carrying in challenger if they get a lead
[22284.48s -> 22287.60s]  Then in diamond if they get a lead if if that like
[22288.40s -> 22293.20s]  I know that sounds weird to say but that's it's it's basically just because like when your teammates are better
[22293.20s -> 22298.80s]  They enable you better and ad carry and all those other roles when they're being enabled. It's a lot easier to play the game
[22304.16s -> 22308.40s]  Like if I were to first pick jinx in challenger MMR
[22308.96s -> 22312.64s]  There's a good chance my teammates would pick stuff that like lets me play jinx
[22313.12s -> 22317.04s]  Right, not saying it would happen, but there's like a chance that my teammates would pick something that like
[22317.84s -> 22320.32s]  They would pick like tanks or front liners or some shit, right?
[22320.80s -> 22324.40s]  Or like lulu whereas like if you pick in if you're picking jinx first picking like
[22324.96s -> 22326.64s]  Let's say you guys are gold average
[22327.12s -> 22331.20s]  Like your support might just literally pick like first time valkons or some shit and you're like well this sucks
[22333.68s -> 22335.68s]  I
[22343.68s -> 22346.00s]  Dude I swear every time I hear the end of this song
[22346.80s -> 22348.80s]  Does anybody know who forest within is?
[22350.40s -> 22355.52s]  I swear the guy talking at the end of this song sounds exactly like forest within
[22357.28s -> 22359.28s]  No joke listen to this listen to this
[22364.40s -> 22366.40s]  That
[22367.52s -> 22372.40s]  That guy who was like saying it was dj what like that guy sounded exactly like I don't know why my brain does that
[22372.64s -> 22376.08s]  Homie sounded exactly like forest within I swear to god
[22376.56s -> 22381.36s]  It's actually like perfectly like if you told me that was him. I would immediately believe you
[22386.64s -> 22388.64s]  This guy wants to join the discord
[22390.48s -> 22392.48s]  Oh, I'm I'm nervous about this shit
[22394.32s -> 22398.72s]  It is my support though. So like maybe we could join the discord
[22401.76s -> 22404.24s]  And like work together a bit
[22410.32s -> 22414.82s]  But I'm also nervous about joining discord calls with people on stream
[22414.82s -> 22416.82s]  I
[22421.38s -> 22423.54s]  Don't know I don't know if it's worth
[22424.42s -> 22427.46s]  Where would you put ezreal on the tier list? I think ezreal's a tier
[22428.10s -> 22433.62s]  I think he he could be s tier for solo queue, but he's hard. He's really hard ezreal's one of the hardest 80s
[22433.94s -> 22435.06s]  So
[22435.06s -> 22438.10s]  I would say he's like a tier right now if you're really good at this
[22439.22s -> 22441.30s]  He is very very very strong
[22442.26s -> 22444.26s]  But he's also incredibly hard to play
[22445.78s -> 22450.66s]  But he also is not weak in the meta so I'd give him like strong a
[22452.82s -> 22454.82s]  Like above other a's
[22456.58s -> 22460.02s]  She focused on mage supports like brand xerath or engage like blitz nautilus
[22460.66s -> 22462.82s]  It depends on your elo and it depends on what you're doing
[22463.86s -> 22466.26s]  I think engage supports and lower elo are
[22469.38s -> 22471.38s]  Bad
[22472.34s -> 22479.38s]  I don't somebody dodged I think engage supports and lower elo are bad personally because I think that uh
[22481.94s -> 22487.62s]  You can be a really good engage player and it doesn't matter if your team just gets caught over and over again
[22487.70s -> 22490.58s]  Or if you like make it engage and your team misplays, right?
[22491.06s -> 22493.06s]  So it's like if you want to
[22493.30s -> 22499.14s]  Play engage supports do it because they are better than other like engage supports are better than mages
[22499.46s -> 22502.74s]  But I think in solo queue mages are better to solo carry
[22503.46s -> 22507.06s]  So it just depends it depends on your elo and it depends on like what you're trying to accomplish, right?
[22507.86s -> 22510.90s]  Because a lot of the time is a support player. It's why I play senna
[22511.30s -> 22516.02s]  Right like I play senna because I like being able to carry games as support
[22516.66s -> 22518.66s]  That's why I like senna
[22519.14s -> 22521.14s]  Whereas like if you're a um
[22522.26s -> 22525.70s]  Like if I like I can play almost every support right I can play nautilus
[22525.70s -> 22527.70s]  I can play play I can play these supports
[22527.70s -> 22532.50s]  But the problem is is like I feel bad if like I get like it feels really shitty to get people ahead
[22532.58s -> 22535.94s]  And then have them completely throw their leads over and over again and then tilt and range and shit
[22536.26s -> 22538.10s]  So it feels like dog shits
[22538.10s -> 22544.50s]  So it's nicer to just like give myself the opportunity to carry rather than rely 100 on other people, you know
[22547.06s -> 22549.06s]  But I would say the number one thing is
[22550.42s -> 22552.42s]  Play what you think is fun
[22552.42s -> 22555.14s]  That's just the number one rule like playing if you want to win
[22555.62s -> 22556.98s]  You can play meta
[22556.98s -> 22561.62s]  But the problem is is if like you're shoving your face into trying to learn a meta champ that you just don't enjoy the play style
[22561.62s -> 22566.98s]  Of you're never going to actually be good at the at the champion because you're you're like it's like you're working, right?
[22567.54s -> 22571.30s]  But the best way to learn the champions and learn how to play the game is to have fun
[22571.70s -> 22573.62s]  Because you're not having fun at some point
[22573.62s -> 22577.70s]  You're not going to be able to learn how to play because you're not going to be able to put in the hours
[22577.78s -> 22580.26s]  Or put in the games and like be focused during the game
[22580.26s -> 22582.98s]  You're going to be frustrated and if you're frustrated you're not going to be learning
[22583.46s -> 22585.46s]  So I would say just play something that's fun
[22588.58s -> 22590.74s]  The fun aspect is going to be way more important
[22596.18s -> 22598.18s]  Where'd my music go fuck
[22598.74s -> 22600.74s]  You
[22608.90s -> 22614.10s]  I'm surprised can you guys even hear the music half the time I have it on so low that I'm not even sure you guys can hear it
[22615.38s -> 22617.38s]  It's just like bear me background noise
[22629.14s -> 22646.98s]  Is this guy holding swap hostage join call and I'll swap
[22653.54s -> 22656.04s]  Dude he's holding swap hostage
[22659.14s -> 22671.62s]  By the way, if you guys do like the stream don't forget to follow you can scroll down to see all my socials too
[22672.34s -> 22674.98s]  Like tech talk instagram all that crap
[22675.78s -> 22678.04s]  It's all below the stream. There's like links and shit
[22678.04s -> 22692.20s]  And uh, you know a man's gotta eat you can use your touch prime too if you want, you know you're feeling it
[22704.44s -> 22706.44s]  I'm gonna do a kaisa game
[22706.68s -> 22712.60s]  He went lux but I kind of want to play kaisa
[22716.20s -> 22718.92s]  What was the voice this is what happens when I get close to the mic
[22722.36s -> 22728.28s]  I I should put the mic in front of my face more the mic's like over to the corner so the mic is like really badly directions
[22736.44s -> 22738.44s]  I
[22752.84s -> 22754.84s]  Says a cut down game
[22757.24s -> 22763.16s]  Gregor's always use ap he doesn't go tank he goes like ap I kind of want to go last stands
[22766.44s -> 22768.44s]  I
[22779.80s -> 22783.64s]  That's fun. I should have taken ghost ghost that went so good this game
[22785.88s -> 22787.88s]  Fuck
[22788.68s -> 22791.96s]  You tried kate with shield bow it's strong. Yeah, it's fun, huh?
[22793.96s -> 22795.96s]  I love kate with shield bow it's so fun
[22796.60s -> 22798.60s]  This would have been such a good ghost game
[22799.72s -> 22801.72s]  I'm frustrated. Oh well
[22803.00s -> 22805.00s]  I like wasn't paying attention
[22809.96s -> 22811.96s]  All right
[22815.32s -> 22819.56s]  I I always wonder if I should go part of me always wants to go like
[22820.44s -> 22825.56s]  Uh long sword three against thresh and zaya but with kaisa
[22826.20s -> 22829.96s]  I feel like you're on really specific timers with kaisa. So you have to go like
[22830.92s -> 22832.92s]  It's really important to go
[22833.08s -> 22838.20s]  Doran so they even get the q upgrade timer on the right, you know like on the right timing
[22839.72s -> 22841.88s]  I've been getting the q upgrade timers just so big
[22843.32s -> 22846.60s]  Also this game. I feel like I go bork this game
[22847.32s -> 22849.32s]  Seconds borker what's ends?
[22850.28s -> 22855.16s]  If gregas is not ultra fed I'll probably go bork because I don't want to get what's in just for gregas
[22865.16s -> 22867.16s]  Okay, you started q
[22867.56s -> 22869.56s]  Oh
[22875.08s -> 22878.28s]  Oh diana's starting on wolves, okay
[22881.56s -> 22886.20s]  It's a good day for a hunt. I need to get some coffee after this game. We're getting drowsy
[22897.16s -> 22899.16s]  I
[22905.96s -> 22911.72s]  Should have done the middle minion thing. I'm so bad like I should have legitimately just done the thing with the minion
[22917.08s -> 22921.72s]  So when you know thresh starts hook you can still play up right I can play up I can play aggressive
[22927.16s -> 22929.16s]  I
[22940.20s -> 22947.64s]  Bad I should have just killed the thresh. This is really bad man. We can't help we can't help
[22950.28s -> 22953.48s]  Because the wave the way the wave is going oh, I'm so bad I fucked up
[22953.56s -> 22960.36s]  It should be fine, but I still like we're it it fucks us over early game
[22962.68s -> 22964.68s]  Because they fucked up very badly
[22966.20s -> 22969.72s]  Like I can't stress enough how badly they just fucked up, but it didn't matter
[22971.32s -> 22972.68s]  Okay
[22972.68s -> 22974.68s]  That's that's happening apparently
[22975.72s -> 22979.72s]  Don't worry guys. I'm the best zaya player or kaisa player on the server. It's me
[22983.80s -> 22985.80s]  I
[22988.84s -> 22991.08s]  Caught I am just literally playing like dog shits
[23006.52s -> 23008.92s]  I picked kaisa I just felt like playing her
[23014.36s -> 23019.72s]  We got a back we have to leave the wave in a bad spot. Maybe she can push it but like wukong serice
[23029.08s -> 23031.24s]  Yeah, we just okay, we got it nice not bad
[23032.44s -> 23033.96s]  So we had to push the wave in there
[23033.96s -> 23035.56s]  Uh, so that the wave will bounce back
[23035.96s -> 23038.04s]  But we had to do it on a it was a really bad timer
[23038.52s -> 23042.52s]  Let me just say I I fucked up the entire early game of this game like this games. I'm so bad
[23043.64s -> 23048.44s]  Essentially, what should have happened was level one when they walked up when kaisa and thresh walked up level one
[23048.92s -> 23051.00s]  We should have killed them like I should have just straight up
[23051.72s -> 23056.84s]  Hit the thresh with the uh locks because thresh walked into our wave because wukong was level two ganking
[23057.16s -> 23058.28s]  Should have just killed him
[23058.28s -> 23061.00s]  I grieved that and because I went for the zaya instead
[23061.08s -> 23064.04s]  I put myself in a spot where I took like 80 of my hp for free
[23064.68s -> 23068.44s]  Right, which put me behind and now the entire fight was like harder
[23068.76s -> 23072.84s]  Because I was low and then we had to wait for the way it was just it was really bad
[23074.28s -> 23075.72s]  Really?
[23075.72s -> 23078.36s]  That minion actually just did that
[23082.44s -> 23086.60s]  I don't think we can kill this guy unless she can max range land a q or something, but yeah
[23092.36s -> 23095.72s]  Is zary the best lady right now, uh, no, I think jinx is better
[23096.68s -> 23098.04s]  I think zary is good
[23098.04s -> 23101.48s]  Uh her white game she especially with like paired with an enchanter is always insane
[23102.28s -> 23104.78s]  But I think jinx is uh better for solo q
[23106.76s -> 23108.76s]  Uh-oh I actually have to flash
[23113.72s -> 23116.28s]  That was a good play hook by that guy I disrespected him
[23119.56s -> 23122.28s]  I might have to leave because wukong can just go here and dive me
[23125.56s -> 23130.12s]  I actually just have to leave this feels so bad you see how wukong just used the plants
[23132.12s -> 23135.80s]  If I stay I can just die right so I'm just misplaying all over the place
[23136.36s -> 23139.08s]  I'm taking too much damage. We're playing weak side right now, right?
[23139.88s -> 23143.72s]  What I mean by that is like we know our diana's top and we know their wukong's bot
[23144.20s -> 23146.92s]  So because of that I need to play a lot less
[23146.92s -> 23150.92s]  Trady like I walked up and just let the thresh fly me for free and I missed two waves now
[23151.32s -> 23153.88s]  I need to not do that because if I don't miss these waves
[23153.96s -> 23158.20s]  It doesn't matter for weak siding because I'm not behind so it's it's just really stupid
[23161.88s -> 23166.84s]  Now what I do want to do is I want to go check and see if the wukong's like on our camps or something
[23167.24s -> 23169.24s]  Or if he's doing dragon or some shits
[23172.52s -> 23177.08s]  Okay, I should not have used the blast cone dude. I am so bad
[23178.52s -> 23180.52s]  I used the blast cone to just hit it
[23180.84s -> 23184.12s]  It's playing support man. It makes your it makes your brain smaller
[23185.56s -> 23187.56s]  Actually
[23191.48s -> 23193.48s]  Oh
[23200.92s -> 23202.92s]  Like I swear playing support makes my brain smaller
[23211.08s -> 23213.08s]  Oh, they're in dragon
[23221.48s -> 23223.48s]  I
[23232.92s -> 23235.96s]  Ziya's trolling I think
[23238.52s -> 23240.36s]  Pretty sure I just freeze this no with the lux
[23245.72s -> 23247.72s]  Yeah, she's just trolling I don't know what the fuck that was
[23247.96s -> 23254.60s]  I took a little bit of damage, but she has to overextend now
[23254.60s -> 23256.60s]  No
[23276.12s -> 23278.12s]  Not bad. Okay, so
[23278.12s -> 23283.32s]  Does I wanted to back the reason that I froze that was because I wants to back but she can't back until we push the wave in
[23284.20s -> 23286.20s]  Or until they push the wave in right so
[23286.68s -> 23289.56s]  It gives me time to kind of catch up on my back timer with the ziya
[23290.44s -> 23292.44s]  Because I'm you know a little bit behind in farm
[23300.92s -> 23306.92s]  Uh thresh is definitely going to go mid here. He's either going to go mid or he's going to try and hook us from the bush
[23308.76s -> 23313.00s]  I think I'm going to shoot my w through all the bushes here. Okay thresh isn't in the bushes
[23313.80s -> 23316.68s]  He's just me. Uh, yeah, we don't know where he is
[23317.56s -> 23319.56s]  This is awkward because I can't really walk up
[23321.48s -> 23323.80s]  I mean, I guess I'm almost sick. So I guess I could walk up
[23325.56s -> 23327.56s]  Yeah, there he is. Okay, we see him
[23332.44s -> 23338.44s]  He is level five so it's we could probably actually fight like if this guy lands a binding I might be able to just trade
[23343.88s -> 23346.92s]  I just I am I'm dead
[23350.60s -> 23352.92s]  I suck honestly I I needed to my bad
[23355.96s -> 23357.96s]  I'm playing bad that's on me
[23359.56s -> 23361.88s]  The locks is playing so good. I needed to uh
[23362.76s -> 23366.28s]  W but then back up after the bind. I've just I'm mechanically
[23367.08s -> 23369.48s]  Shitting on myself right now like out of my mouth. Just shit
[23369.48s -> 23371.48s]  I have no idea what looks just
[23373.00s -> 23376.76s]  Because I knew exactly what was going to happen when I used w in front of the fucking thresh's face. I was like
[23377.64s -> 23379.64s]  Here we go. You know what I mean?
[23379.88s -> 23383.48s]  Technically we're both six and he's five but he doesn't matter because if I get hooked
[23384.28s -> 23386.28s]  I don't have enough damage. So
[23387.72s -> 23389.72s]  Now here
[23393.56s -> 23399.24s]  I'm gonna walk up and see if I can stop this zayas back maybe I mean, she's backing in a weird spot
[23400.36s -> 23404.44s]  Yeah, we stopped their backs huge. Okay now they're in trouble
[23406.36s -> 23407.96s]  So
[23407.96s -> 23409.96s]  They really needed the back on that timer
[23411.16s -> 23415.96s]  Because they just want to fight right and because they just want to fight they want to go back right
[23417.88s -> 23419.88s]  No way
[23422.60s -> 23426.04s]  Dude fuck off. I cannot dodge a hook right now to save my fucking life
[23427.32s -> 23429.08s]  Jesus christ
[23429.08s -> 23431.08s]  What is my movement man?
[23433.72s -> 23435.72s]  Like tilting myself right now
[23442.60s -> 23445.24s]  I want to stay for this wave but mid is mia
[23447.88s -> 23449.88s]  Yeah, I can't
[23450.76s -> 23452.44s]  It feels so bad
[23452.44s -> 23454.84s]  Because I needed one more wave to get double pickaxe
[23455.72s -> 23457.48s]  So I can get my upgrade
[23457.56s -> 23459.72s]  Because like normally you go noon quiver pickaxe pickaxe
[23460.20s -> 23462.04s]  If you go noon pick pick
[23462.04s -> 23465.24s]  It gives you enough ad to get your q upgrade, right? And that's like the whole point
[23465.24s -> 23468.44s]  You don't need cracking you just need your q upgrade because your q upgrades when you start bursting
[23469.64s -> 23474.20s]  But because I got hooked under the turrets even though we got a kill I had to back and I couldn't get my timer
[23477.64s -> 23479.64s]  I'm so trash
[23479.88s -> 23481.88s]  I was spared for
[23486.12s -> 23491.16s]  I need some coffee. That's one of those men. I swear to god coffee is my savior. It'll save me
[23510.44s -> 23512.44s]  I
[23520.76s -> 23526.76s]  That wave actually just did that to me holy shits. We don't actually have to do anything here crazy
[23526.76s -> 23528.76s]  I
[23539.16s -> 23541.16s]  Nice walk ahead
[23547.48s -> 23549.48s]  Nice
[23557.48s -> 23561.96s]  Nice nice nice that was a good to be to
[23570.28s -> 23576.68s]  All right, I got my q upgrade now we're chillin. Oh now we're have a chillin. Oh, yeah, baby
[23581.72s -> 23583.72s]  You know what it is it's like uh
[23584.68s -> 23586.68s]  I'm playing the fights too quick
[23591.72s -> 23594.28s]  I just got to slow down and like think I'm like too hyped up
[23606.28s -> 23613.56s]  I really don't want to miss this wave. There's a person right there. Oh shit, let's go. Yeah, he's dead
[23613.96s -> 23615.96s]  Okay, I'm gonna go farm bot. Well that guy gets that
[23620.68s -> 23622.68s]  This locks is really good
[23632.20s -> 23634.28s]  I kind of want to oh, I can't get this play it fuck
[23636.60s -> 23640.36s]  What what that was bs
[23644.28s -> 23649.64s]  Okay, you know what I'll just take my entire HP bar really quick on the turret. It's not a big deal guys
[23651.24s -> 23656.68s]  I'm just I'm that good at the game like I don't mean to brag but like, you know professional gamer over here like, you know
[23659.32s -> 23661.32s]  I'm gonna be the one some lessons like I got you
[23670.92s -> 23672.92s]  Dude look how big my shield is
[23673.88s -> 23675.88s]  Legendary
[23686.76s -> 23692.92s]  Wait you son of a bitch I mean she's dead but
[23704.12s -> 23708.68s]  I got out playing man
[23713.16s -> 23715.16s]  Motherfucker
[23726.84s -> 23728.84s]  All right, they four for the nice
[23729.56s -> 23731.56s]  Oh
[23733.16s -> 23739.16s]  Well, I need to make some coffee. I'm playing give me a sec. We're playing real bad. I need some coffee
[23739.48s -> 23741.48s]  You
[23753.64s -> 23759.88s]  Nice though we hit 400 LP let's go so now we just need 150 more we need 550. I think 550 is gem
[23769.32s -> 23774.92s]  I didn't do anything that game by the way, I did nothing
[23776.60s -> 23781.40s]  I could play another ad carry game that was fun. Uh, I'm gonna grab some coffee. I'll be right back
[23783.00s -> 23785.80s]  Talks amongst yourselves boys. I believe in you
[23787.08s -> 23790.36s]  You can look at my ad carry tier list that we've been trying to figure out how to do
[23791.40s -> 23793.40s]  Enjoy, I'll be right
[23795.40s -> 23797.40s]  Fucking
[23799.16s -> 23801.48s]  You
[23829.16s -> 23831.16s]  You
[23859.16s -> 23861.88s]  You
[23889.96s -> 23891.96s]  You
[23896.20s -> 23899.48s]  All right, I'm back let's go
[23901.56s -> 23907.00s]  The fuck sweet be back boys
[23911.40s -> 23913.40s]  We back
[23913.88s -> 23915.88s]  Uh
[23918.76s -> 23925.32s]  Time is it five oh I probably play for like another hour and then I gotta get off and make some dinner
[23927.32s -> 23929.88s]  Do some other shit, you know what I'm saying
[23929.88s -> 23931.88s]  I
[23939.88s -> 23943.24s]  Worry oh, yeah, we're making the tier list. Yeah, I think Varus is really good a
[23944.84s -> 23946.84s]  I think Varus is good a tier because um
[23948.28s -> 23949.48s]  In my opinion
[23949.48s -> 23953.08s]  Varus is never really like a bad pick almost like sometimes he's bad
[23953.08s -> 23957.80s]  But I think he's just you can play him on hit or you can play him without he right
[23957.80s -> 23960.36s]  So he's got two builds that you can do based on the game in the team comp
[23960.84s -> 23962.84s]  His ulti is pretty much always useful
[23963.80s -> 23967.72s]  Like just having a stun like a root on a champion is always going to be useful, right?
[23968.12s -> 23973.00s]  Then you have he's got a very long range like engage. You can safely kill people with his ult in his queue
[23973.56s -> 23977.32s]  Uh, you can build him poke or like before objectives. You can make picks really easily
[23977.32s -> 23979.32s]  You can poke people out before the objective get him low
[23980.12s -> 23984.60s]  His lane phase is really good if you're if you understand like how to play Varus his lane phase is exceptional
[23985.08s -> 23987.08s]  he also has
[23988.04s -> 23990.84s]  In the meta currently I feel like he's just like a good pick
[23991.00s -> 23993.64s]  I don't think he's as good as draven and jinx for solo queue
[23994.20s -> 23996.04s]  But I do think he's really good
[23996.04s -> 23998.84s]  Um in general you can you can climb with him really easily
[24000.04s -> 24002.12s]  And then uh, I put ash here too
[24003.16s -> 24005.32s]  Maybe ash. I don't know who I'd put in front
[24006.68s -> 24008.28s]  Ash or Varus
[24008.28s -> 24011.88s]  I feel like maybe ash or maybe Varus. I think ash is really underrated though
[24011.88s -> 24013.88s]  I think ash is super super good right now
[24017.08s -> 24022.44s]  She's basically the same idea as Varus. She's a little different, but she's the same idea. Um
[24023.88s -> 24028.52s]  She controls lane phase pretty well, right like her lane isn't too bad. She also has
[24030.20s -> 24032.68s]  Like her r always useful no matter what
[24033.56s -> 24035.56s]  I think she's super good
[24035.56s -> 24037.56s]  I think she's super good
[24037.56s -> 24039.56s]  Uh, because
[24039.56s -> 24041.56s]  Sorry, I'm trying to think
[24041.56s -> 24046.92s]  Uh, she's basically the same idea as Varus. She's a little different, but she's the same idea. Um
[24047.08s -> 24052.68s]  So like you'll always have use with ash. You'll always have use with Varus are like they they just stuns snares, etc
[24052.68s -> 24054.12s]  And solo queue
[24054.12s -> 24056.12s]  She's also really good at being annoying in teamfights
[24056.12s -> 24058.28s]  Like you can take ghost on ash and you can just
[24058.68s -> 24061.80s]  Volley sit outside the range and if you just be basically solo people
[24062.28s -> 24064.60s]  And she actually has decent scaling on her crit now. So
[24065.32s -> 24068.20s]  You can go a bunch of builds too. Like I think you can go bork ash
[24068.36s -> 24072.84s]  You can go crack and slayer ash into bork or you could go crack and slayer into i.e
[24072.84s -> 24074.84s]  Or you can go crack and slayer into like
[24075.64s -> 24078.44s]  Whatever you can go shield bow ash if they have tanks you can go gale force that
[24078.44s -> 24081.48s]  Oh, you can just do a lot of different builds on ash and I think she's really versatile
[24081.80s -> 24084.20s]  You can also just go the on head build if you really want. I
[24084.84s -> 24087.88s]  I think the rageblade build sucks personally. I think that if I was going to go on hit
[24087.88s -> 24090.60s]  I would just be like shield bow wits and into like
[24091.24s -> 24093.64s]  Bork or some shit if I was actually going to do that or shield bow
[24094.28s -> 24096.28s]  Bork or bork wits or whatever, but
[24097.48s -> 24099.48s]  Yeah
[24101.08s -> 24103.48s]  Uh, I don't know Ezreal is probably a tier two
[24105.08s -> 24107.32s]  I said Ezreal is really gated by like skill
[24108.20s -> 24111.96s]  So I don't want to put him in I I think if you could play Ezreal perfectly
[24111.96s -> 24113.64s]  He'd be at the top of s like he would just be
[24114.28s -> 24115.64s]  Above jinx
[24115.64s -> 24122.12s]  Just best champion of the game if you could if you could never miss a skill shot like 100 accuracy playing perfect like the champs insane, right?
[24122.84s -> 24125.40s]  It's absolutely crazy. How good that champ is if you can play him perfect
[24125.48s -> 24127.80s]  But you're like people are humans etc
[24128.36s -> 24132.68s]  So I think he's like an a tier pick in solo queue because you can get countered like he's not blindable
[24132.76s -> 24134.76s]  You can get countered pretty easily by good players
[24135.32s -> 24137.88s]  People play like push comps people play dive comps
[24138.52s -> 24142.76s]  Like early game. I mean in lane and shits like because Ezreal's lane is like not it's not bad
[24143.16s -> 24147.56s]  But it's very difficult to play Ezreal well in lane fate. You got to be good mechanically
[24148.04s -> 24152.12s]  And I don't think uh, even like I've seen like challenger players who can't play Ezreal so
[24153.32s -> 24155.32s]  He's not easy
[24155.64s -> 24157.64s]  You know what I'm saying
[24163.24s -> 24165.24s]  You
[24169.48s -> 24171.48s]  What's up boys
[24178.20s -> 24180.20s]  So
[24193.08s -> 24199.80s]  I was gonna be in kindred but I couldn't find her I hate kindred
[24205.08s -> 24207.58s]  Yo, how we doing tonight? How's everybody's day?
[24223.16s -> 24228.60s]  Okay, so this guy is picking thresh again
[24247.16s -> 24249.96s]  Thresh into recon thresh is actually pretty good in the recon
[24252.68s -> 24254.68s]  They have xyre thresh again
[24270.12s -> 24272.12s]  Hmm
[24272.12s -> 24274.12s]  Hmm
[24281.08s -> 24283.08s]  Let's play jinx
[24284.84s -> 24286.84s]  I like jinx here
[24287.32s -> 24292.04s]  Even though it is against thresh jinx is a little scary, right, but I kind of like her in this situation
[24293.00s -> 24295.00s]  I
[24299.24s -> 24304.52s]  See what runs do I want free boots? No, I think I want I want to be able to get early boots this game
[24307.48s -> 24309.48s]  Because their team comp is like
[24310.12s -> 24313.48s]  Oh, yeah, their team comp is really really annoying. So I kind of want to get
[24315.56s -> 24317.56s]  Early boots
[24317.64s -> 24320.76s]  I'll probably go present some mines
[24321.64s -> 24323.64s]  Although I think over hill isn't bad
[24327.40s -> 24329.40s]  Actually, I'll go over hill
[24329.96s -> 24333.48s]  So, yeah, let's these these runes look good. Actually, let's do this
[24335.32s -> 24337.32s]  What this this
[24339.72s -> 24341.72s]  This
[24342.92s -> 24347.40s]  Yeah, this is good. Okay. I kind of like these this is good. I'm gonna use these. Okay
[24348.20s -> 24354.68s]  I'm taking clients this game because uh, they have lasandra and pantheon and thresh, right? So with lasandra pantheon and thresh
[24356.76s -> 24360.68s]  The game's gonna be like really fast of like, okay, if they stun me
[24360.68s -> 24364.36s]  I'm just gonna get cc chained and I'm just gonna die like after a bit, right
[24364.92s -> 24367.72s]  It's gonna be like a stun and they're starting and they're starting and I'm just gonna die
[24371.40s -> 24373.40s]  So I'm like, nah, fuck that shit
[24378.44s -> 24380.44s]  You
[24392.68s -> 24394.68s]  All right
[24400.20s -> 24402.20s]  Let's see if we can get this w boys
[24408.52s -> 24412.12s]  Let's see if I can not fuck up the first three levels of the lane
[24416.20s -> 24419.40s]  Got chat restricted. Oh, yeah, it's for a while
[24423.48s -> 24428.84s]  It's riot secret code to make it so I can actually play the game and climb without chatting
[24437.88s -> 24450.76s]  Okay, I should have warded this bush
[24453.64s -> 24459.32s]  I was drinking my coffee and I didn't think about it, but yeah, if you guys are against the hook champ, uh, always ward this bush
[24459.64s -> 24464.76s]  Right like right here you're gonna want to
[24466.04s -> 24468.04s]  Ward here early against the most hook champions
[24469.24s -> 24471.56s]  Because it gives you a very nice
[24472.28s -> 24475.48s]  Like they can't walk in here and cheese you they can't walk in here and cheese you
[24476.12s -> 24478.36s]  So you just don't get cheesed by anything
[24490.12s -> 24492.12s]  I
[24505.64s -> 24507.64s]  Mean that's just
[24510.28s -> 24512.28s]  I don't even know what I just saw
[24513.00s -> 24515.24s]  I'll be real. I don't know what the fuck just happened. But okay
[24516.68s -> 24518.68s]  Trying to push this wave as fast as I can
[24519.48s -> 24521.98s]  I'm not sure I can actually get it pushed fast enough, but we're gonna try
[24532.60s -> 24534.60s]  Damn it was close
[24539.72s -> 24542.84s]  No, I'm gonna let it just push it's not a huge deal
[24544.04s -> 24546.04s]  It was very close though
[24546.20s -> 24548.36s]  We can just break the freeze right like it's not a huge deal
[24549.88s -> 24555.32s]  Are they supposed to win level one it depends I mean
[24556.04s -> 24558.04s]  Ziya's not that good level one like
[24558.60s -> 24560.92s]  She Ziya's good because she has her feathers, right?
[24561.16s -> 24564.20s]  But if you can't stack your feathers level one jinx has more damage
[24565.00s -> 24567.24s]  And they stacked up for my gap or for my rocket
[24567.32s -> 24574.12s]  So I got like I full stacked my lethal tempo and I just double aoe rocketed them over and over and over and over again, right
[24574.12s -> 24584.44s]  And so when they finally all end they were just behind an hp also thresh missed. He only had flay
[24604.12s -> 24615.00s]  Damn that was so close man, like actually
[24629.88s -> 24633.32s]  If thresh had died there or not thresh it graves had died there
[24633.32s -> 24635.32s]  We just win the game
[24648.84s -> 24651.00s]  Yeah, this isn't good. Oh, I'm gonna get flayed. I'm dead
[24652.52s -> 24655.24s]  Maybe oh, maybe I'm not dead. I have to walk up like this
[24657.24s -> 24660.36s]  It was a really bad fight by the what what am I watching what the fuck
[24661.08s -> 24664.12s]  That was just a bad fight because um
[24665.72s -> 24669.48s]  We knew graves was bot and we knew that he was gonna heal in the jungle, right?
[24670.36s -> 24674.28s]  So like my jungler already got outplayed by graves once top side
[24674.76s -> 24679.96s]  You shouldn't ever take another fight like that bot side. You should just take the win, right? Like I rotated
[24681.00s -> 24684.36s]  Now granted the rakan should have been there to help kill the graves
[24684.92s -> 24687.88s]  Like when I rotated rakan was still jacking off annoying
[24688.44s -> 24693.32s]  Right like when I was here rakan was like way down here. So the support should have rotated first
[24694.68s -> 24697.24s]  Right like I rotated but the support should have been the one rotating
[24697.32s -> 24702.28s]  But again, he's just a lot of the time you have support players who don't understand timers and I had to help
[24702.52s -> 24704.12s]  Nobody plays for jungle
[24704.12s -> 24706.28s]  support players hate playing for jungle in low elo
[24707.08s -> 24708.20s]  So
[24708.20s -> 24710.20s]  It's just not a thing
[24710.36s -> 24714.60s]  So I tried to go over and help him but I misplaced my traps a little bit
[24715.24s -> 24717.24s]  And then
[24717.80s -> 24719.80s]  The graves had a flash, but he got away
[24720.84s -> 24724.60s]  And uh, they tried to go in again when I was too low to actually help
[24725.48s -> 24727.96s]  We we just got lucky. We didn't lose the game off that shit
[24732.04s -> 24734.54s]  Kind of does suck though. Ziya's really strong now
[24744.68s -> 24746.68s]  Oh
[24749.96s -> 24755.88s]  Not bad. I should have oh, I should have I could have killed her. I supposed to I could have killed the guy
[24758.04s -> 24760.04s]  No joke, I totally could have killed him
[24761.00s -> 24764.60s]  If I had warded the lantern as he tried to take it I would have killed the ziya
[24766.92s -> 24768.92s]  Because she ego'd the lantern there
[24775.00s -> 24777.00s]  She
[24778.76s -> 24784.36s]  Ego'd the lantern so hard if I had if I had warded it she dies there. It's my bad
[24795.24s -> 24797.24s]  This game's really interesting because
[24798.84s -> 24800.84s]  The enemy ball lanes actually misplaying a lot
[24801.80s -> 24806.44s]  Like they're they're really really really misplaying these fights and trades and shit, but uh
[24807.40s -> 24809.40s]  We can't abuse it
[24810.44s -> 24812.84s]  Because the graves has so much control of the game right now
[24813.56s -> 24818.44s]  That we have to basically play safe permanently at the moments and I can't do anything to help my team
[24819.00s -> 24821.00s]  It feels really bad
[24821.00s -> 24823.00s]  I
[24827.32s -> 24829.32s]  Want my guys again? Yeah, there we went
[24836.76s -> 24839.26s]  See you look graves with bot again man, this is so rough
[24848.68s -> 24850.68s]  Graves is mad
[24851.32s -> 24855.24s]  I want to kill this as fast as I can
[24865.64s -> 24867.48s]  We can fight these guys to be to actually
[24871.48s -> 24873.48s]  Wait, why didn't he just go in?
[24881.96s -> 24886.84s]  I don't know why he didn't just double you immediately like the recon waited. Oh, that tilts me
[24887.72s -> 24891.88s]  Like when she was against the wall here, he should have immediately w'd her
[24894.36s -> 24895.80s]  Because
[24895.80s -> 24898.92s]  If he w's from vision there right and and she's against the wall
[24899.56s -> 24901.40s]  It helps us so much
[24901.40s -> 24904.52s]  Because then I can I can overlay my flame chumps on top of the
[24905.88s -> 24908.68s]  I can overlay my flame chumps directly on top of the ziya
[24909.48s -> 24916.04s]  Right as the fight's uh happening rather than like having to work around the fight because thresh is in my face type shit, you know
[24920.52s -> 24923.48s]  So we're just we're honestly just losing because we're not pulling the trigger fast enough
[24925.72s -> 24928.52s]  And we can't play aggressive when we can pull the trigger
[24930.76s -> 24935.24s]  Right like we're losing because we can't pull the trigger fast enough and when we can't pull the trigger it's uh the wrong time
[24935.96s -> 24942.36s]  We do this right now we we get dragon the bot lane back do we get dragon here?
[24949.08s -> 24952.60s]  I want to go uh I actually want to go
[24956.12s -> 24959.16s]  Wait the enemy bot lane didn't back okay, they're trolling
[24963.08s -> 24965.08s]  They lost an objective for free here. This is really good
[24965.80s -> 24968.60s]  So the enemy bot lane we fight this by the way we just we can just straight up fight
[24978.92s -> 24982.68s]  That right there is how you lantern how you've more to lantern by the way
[24985.40s -> 24987.40s]  Oh, I did that guy's so dirty
[24992.28s -> 24994.28s]  Oh, I'm dead. Bye guys
[24996.04s -> 24998.04s]  I
[25001.08s -> 25007.16s]  Didn't know pantheon was Mia. That was my bad. I was like going I was too happy with warding the lantern
[25009.72s -> 25011.72s]  My bad
[25015.32s -> 25018.60s]  I can't believe the enemy team greeted that hard though for gold
[25019.32s -> 25021.32s]  Oh
[25022.84s -> 25024.84s]  Yeah, that's actually nuts to me
[25031.80s -> 25034.68s]  No, yeah, the the Ziya is egoing like crazy
[25036.36s -> 25041.56s]  The problem is I can't abuse it constantly because like obviously like I need teammates, right?
[25042.68s -> 25044.68s]  But I can kind of abuse it like uh
[25045.40s -> 25047.80s]  But it's much harder by yourself
[25049.56s -> 25059.64s]  Because as you can see like I I'm not playing poorly, but we're getting like we're getting shit on shit on's a bad word. We're getting like
[25076.04s -> 25078.04s]  Oh, come on man
[25078.60s -> 25080.60s]  They misplayed that so badly
[25083.32s -> 25085.88s]  But rakan just ate the fucking
[25086.76s -> 25093.08s]  Whatever, I'm not gonna blame rakan. It's fine. I'm so sad about that though. They misplayed that so incredibly badly
[25094.36s -> 25096.36s]  Like so badly
[25096.36s -> 25099.56s]  It was just that like rakan all into the thresh with his ultimate
[25099.88s -> 25101.88s]  But all he had to do there was uh
[25102.36s -> 25106.04s]  Use his e to come back to me and then play front to back afterward
[25106.12s -> 25108.12s]  But he's he he sat there auto-wing the thresh
[25108.84s -> 25113.08s]  But you you don't need to auto him. You just need to engage and then I can maybe play after it
[25117.00s -> 25120.28s]  I probably could have double killed them there too. I kind of messed up
[25122.84s -> 25128.12s]  My team wants out it's not it's it's silly because the game's not even over
[25132.04s -> 25134.04s]  Like we actually can win this
[25135.00s -> 25137.40s]  Like we actually can win this game so incredibly easily
[25138.68s -> 25143.16s]  So easily if we just play it correctly because their bot lane is really fucking bad
[25144.04s -> 25148.04s]  I didn't want to be mean, but I'll just be mean their bot lane is really fucking bad
[25155.56s -> 25158.20s]  Well, I'm dead they're still bad
[25160.28s -> 25162.68s]  I'm just egoing. That was my ego
[25165.00s -> 25167.00s]  I still stand by it. I still think they're bad
[25167.80s -> 25173.40s]  This guy's just playing 1v3 mid. The thresh has not been mid one time. So it must be the top laner
[25178.84s -> 25181.48s]  I'm I am so frustrated right now with this game
[25185.88s -> 25190.92s]  Because I feel like we should have won so many all-ins that we didn't win barely like one like barely
[25191.40s -> 25194.52s]  Barely didn't win small ends. I feel like we should have won all of them
[25196.84s -> 25200.68s]  Like they they didn't land like a good all-in once thresh didn't land a single hook once
[25202.68s -> 25207.48s]  And this is my rakan like he just tried to he just used his r to try and engage
[25213.24s -> 25215.48s]  I think nocturne is done mentally
[25215.80s -> 25217.80s]  Okay
[25219.40s -> 25221.40s]  Okay, so in games like this
[25223.32s -> 25225.32s]  Like this thrash is so bad
[25245.80s -> 25251.32s]  Oh, let's go baby huge
[25255.64s -> 25257.64s]  That was so huge let's fucking go
[25257.64s -> 25281.00s]  Like I I'm gonna hit no at 15 because dude, I really don't want to lose to this thrash and asiah
[25282.68s -> 25286.52s]  Like this thrash is doing the most the most ego shit I've ever seen
[25287.96s -> 25292.68s]  And he's just getting away with shit like right there thresh walks up whiffs every spell
[25294.36s -> 25300.52s]  And expects to get away with that shit. No, no, no we win these we win these trust give me let me cook let me cook
[25301.80s -> 25303.80s]  I see my team to let me cook a bit, you know
[25304.84s -> 25309.00s]  Like we had a bad early game had to play weak side. Let me cook let me cook
[25310.76s -> 25312.76s]  We are chilling
[25317.64s -> 25319.64s]  Oh
[25343.88s -> 25345.88s]  If I landed that that would have been sick
[25347.64s -> 25349.64s]  So
[25368.68s -> 25370.68s]  Damn
[25373.72s -> 25375.72s]  Thresh is top two we can kill this guy
[25378.60s -> 25387.80s]  Come on guys, don't forfeit guys the game is winnable. Oh my god
[25389.16s -> 25392.36s]  Dude the game is how is the rakan gonna forfeit?
[25394.76s -> 25397.56s]  Dude that game is so winnable it hurts
[25402.76s -> 25404.76s]  Like dude really
[25405.16s -> 25409.96s]  That actually is so infuriating
[25413.24s -> 25419.08s]  That's so infuriating man that game was so incredibly winnable like look at this
[25421.64s -> 25424.36s]  I did more damage than every single player on the enemy team
[25425.48s -> 25427.72s]  If my team just relaxed
[25428.92s -> 25432.28s]  We win the game a thousand times over that game
[25433.08s -> 25435.08s]  Like the game is over
[25435.96s -> 25439.72s]  We have a rakan a rumble and a wukong for me to sit and sit behind
[25440.52s -> 25445.32s]  And we saw how bad their bot lane was right. I have quens for the only way they can kill me
[25447.16s -> 25452.68s]  Whatever man, dude, I wish to god. I'm gonna report them all like these fuckers. I guarantee I get a notification
[25453.16s -> 25455.16s]  There's no way these people are not toxic
[25457.40s -> 25461.24s]  There's no way you in this like you just want out of the game after a fucking
[25461.88s -> 25463.88s]  Your team is just doing well
[25465.32s -> 25468.20s]  Nah man the score is 10 to 14
[25469.48s -> 25471.48s]  10 to 14
[25473.96s -> 25475.96s]  You have a fed 80 carry
[25481.32s -> 25485.48s]  Look at this dude we forfeited we were down 2.5k
[25486.12s -> 25492.76s]  We had a better scaling comp than them like we outscaled them
[25494.84s -> 25497.64s]  We have two dragons we outscale them
[25498.76s -> 25504.68s]  And we're down 2.5k and my team rage hits forfeit
[25506.44s -> 25512.04s]  Oh my god, that's so gross that is so disgusting
[25515.72s -> 25522.12s]  Why am I in a game with this player? I'm 412 LP masters
[25523.80s -> 25531.48s]  I was in a game just now with a seven LP masters jungler
[25533.72s -> 25536.92s]  And he's not on a smurf this is not a smurf account
[25537.80s -> 25540.04s]  Because last season this guy was d4
[25541.88s -> 25549.16s]  So he's not on a smurf why is this player in my game?
[25552.20s -> 25555.00s]  Why is this player in a 400 LP master game?
[25556.92s -> 25560.52s]  Why or rather why am I in a diamond one game?
[25560.84s -> 25564.12s]  Why or rather why am I in a diamond one game?
[25569.56s -> 25572.60s]  You can go to his previous games. He doesn't even have good MMR
[25573.32s -> 25577.40s]  Like if you look at these games, they're all like what 100 200 LP, right?
[25578.20s -> 25580.92s]  Why am I in this game? Why did you put me in a game with this player?
[25583.00s -> 25585.24s]  Like this guy I don't even care if he sucks
[25585.48s -> 25591.48s]  I'm more frustrated the fact that these players mental boom at the first sign of any negativity look at this
[25592.92s -> 25596.12s]  They just give up first sign of anything negative they go next
[25597.80s -> 25600.84s]  Like I actually could have won v9 to this game too like actually
[25601.40s -> 25607.00s]  But I I'm not allowed to try and 1v9 because my team wants out of the game at fucking four minutes or 15 minutes
[25607.72s -> 25609.72s]  That sucks man
[25610.52s -> 25612.52s]  The new system is trash
[25612.92s -> 25617.40s]  Like I'm sorry, but the the for 15 system is good sometimes
[25618.36s -> 25622.84s]  They should have a requirement that you have to be losing by x amount of gold for it to kick in
[25623.88s -> 25625.88s]  That should that should be it
[25625.88s -> 25627.64s]  They should have a requirement
[25627.64s -> 25630.84s]  You have to be losing by 5k plus for it to work at 15
[25634.28s -> 25636.28s]  Like there needs to be something
[25636.68s -> 25640.68s]  Where there's a requirement because people are so stupid
[25641.40s -> 25648.28s]  Right like that game was 100 hours. We had two dragons. We're down 2000 gold at 16 minutes and
[25648.84s -> 25652.84s]  Wukong's three and one we were down four kills Wukong's three and one
[25656.92s -> 25660.12s]  I'm I'm I'm literally insanely strong
[25661.32s -> 25665.40s]  Even though we got weak sided. I'm still winning. We just 2v2'd them bot side of the map right way
[25665.40s -> 25667.40s]  We just wanted to v2
[25668.36s -> 25670.36s]  Rumble's just like like
[25671.16s -> 25673.16s]  Sorry, I'm just mad. I'm mad
[25673.80s -> 25678.92s]  Like they need to require they need to require something other than four people like require four people and
[25679.48s -> 25681.72s]  A gold lead or something like that's so cancer
[25684.84s -> 25686.84s]  That's so fucking frustrating man
[25689.40s -> 25691.64s]  Like I can't believe how bad people's mentals are
[25692.60s -> 25697.72s]  Like the okay, I get it the the rumble and the the rumble and the nocturne
[25697.72s -> 25703.32s]  I understand wanting to forfeit. Okay, okay, they're having a bad game. They want out. They're raging. They need to get their frustration
[25703.32s -> 25705.32s]  I get it, but why are we forfeiting?
[25709.16s -> 25711.32s]  When Wukong is three and one
[25712.84s -> 25716.76s]  I have seven of our kp. I'm the ad carry. I'm very strong. I just got my mythic
[25717.56s -> 25719.56s]  We have two dragons
[25719.80s -> 25722.36s]  And rakan's forfeiting too. I don't know man
[25724.44s -> 25727.88s]  Ah, that's just frustrating is all
[25733.00s -> 25739.00s]  Like I'll be real I carry this game every day of the week every day of the week I carry those
[25750.12s -> 25752.12s]  You
[25765.64s -> 25770.68s]  So apparently riot is doing something about smurfing though and I can't wait until they do
[25772.36s -> 25776.36s]  This is actually a really good thing that I wanted this that I wanted to talk about earlier in the stream
[25776.36s -> 25777.72s]  But I forgot
[25777.72s -> 25783.08s]  Apparently riot is like doing something to make smurfing harder because like apparently smurfing is outrageous right now
[25783.80s -> 25787.48s]  And I kind of think that they need to stop this too
[25788.52s -> 25792.52s]  So there's a there's a thing you can do in solo queue right now where
[25793.64s -> 25795.64s]  You can make a new account
[25796.04s -> 25798.04s]  And you can duo with somebody
[25799.00s -> 25801.00s]  On different accounts on a new account
[25802.04s -> 25804.52s]  And your m mr doesn't actually get like
[25805.48s -> 25807.48s]  Lowered
[25809.00s -> 25812.20s]  So if you win a game, let's say you win a game
[25814.12s -> 25815.96s]  Um
[25815.96s -> 25818.76s]  I think this is just him wobbling the account, but let's say let's say you win a game
[25819.48s -> 25821.48s]  and in that game you
[25823.56s -> 25828.04s]  Duo with somebody in a lower m mr right now when you duo in a lower m mr
[25828.04s -> 25829.40s]  I don't know if this guy did this or not
[25829.48s -> 25836.44s]  But when you duo with somebody in a lower m mr your m mr is based on now the game thinks that you're in that m mr
[25836.76s -> 25838.76s]  And you can do it in placements
[25839.08s -> 25843.16s]  So in your very first games for some reason there's no m mr lock on placements
[25843.72s -> 25845.72s]  So you can in your placements
[25846.84s -> 25848.84s]  Duo with somebody who's like
[25849.24s -> 25851.40s]  Bronze right and you can play with them
[25852.20s -> 25856.20s]  And then the game thinks you're still winning so it keeps amplifying your m mr
[25857.16s -> 25860.76s]  So when i'm describing this really poorly, but essentially you can duo in lower elos
[25861.24s -> 25863.88s]  And the game doesn't know your m mr belongs
[25864.36s -> 25869.64s]  In that elo because you're winning in that elo the game can't figure that out for some reason the algorithm
[25870.20s -> 25872.36s]  So when they stopped duo queuing
[25873.00s -> 25878.44s]  It still inflated them. It still inflated their m mr to where it would be if they had solo queued
[25879.08s -> 25881.08s]  Does that make sense and what i'm saying?
[25881.72s -> 25884.84s]  So it basically says that they went like 10 and 0 in their placements
[25885.48s -> 25888.04s]  Right so now they're in like a master tier m mr
[25889.00s -> 25891.00s]  From a brand new account
[25891.32s -> 25897.00s]  So now those people are in like d1 masters m mr, but they played they they won in gold
[25899.40s -> 25901.40s]  I also don't think
[25904.04s -> 25906.60s]  You smurfing should be so easily accessible
[25909.56s -> 25911.56s]  Like this guy's not a bad player per se
[25912.12s -> 25916.12s]  But I don't think he's a master tier player right like this guy's a rumble player on a new account
[25917.00s -> 25920.84s]  I I from that game alone the fact he gave up tells me he's not a good player
[25921.24s -> 25923.24s]  You
[25940.28s -> 25942.84s]  Dude i'm i'm a heavy advocator for like
[25943.64s -> 25945.64s]  Riot hat you have to attach
[25945.72s -> 25947.72s]  Like a verification to your accounts
[25948.04s -> 25954.36s]  I know riot would never do that, but i'm like a heavy advocator for like having to attach verification to play ranked
[25957.48s -> 25959.48s]  I think it'd be great honestly
[25961.72s -> 25963.72s]  I think it would help so much
[25975.00s -> 25977.00s]  If you get your verifying account banner you're done for yeah
[25977.80s -> 25982.60s]  You have to get like a vpn to play other than like you would have to that's my point though like
[25983.72s -> 25985.72s]  If you get your verified account banned
[25987.00s -> 25989.50s]  Right like okay that account's done
[25989.50s -> 25991.50s]  I
[26006.14s -> 26009.98s]  Like I said, I don't think riot would ever do it because it's too it's too uh
[26010.78s -> 26015.26s]  Extreme and I don't think riot has the balls to ever do that shit vpn's only five dollars
[26015.82s -> 26018.54s]  Yeah, but dude are you gonna tell me that you're gonna you're gonna buy
[26019.66s -> 26024.62s]  People who get banned on accounts typically get banned consistently. That's why they're making smurfs
[26026.06s -> 26027.18s]  Right
[26027.18s -> 26032.86s]  So you're telling me somebody's going to be willing to pay five dollars for a new phone number verification or whatever
[26033.82s -> 26036.46s]  Every time they have to make a new account. They're not
[26037.18s -> 26039.18s]  You
[26047.42s -> 26049.42s]  Not you me
[26051.58s -> 26053.58s]  Don't I have smurfs. Yeah, I do
[26054.22s -> 26058.70s]  And I stand by all my smurfs should be attached to the same like account
[26059.58s -> 26063.34s]  Like if you make a smurf, okay, this is what I think should happen
[26064.30s -> 26067.26s]  You should be able to put all of your smurfs on one account
[26067.34s -> 26072.54s]  So you you can make smurfs and you can add that smurf verification to an account
[26073.66s -> 26076.06s]  But it kind of like battle.net. Does that make sense?
[26076.46s -> 26081.34s]  You know how like battle.net has all your accounts in the battle.net thing, but you can sign into battle.net
[26082.06s -> 26085.26s]  I think that the way to make make it viable would be like
[26085.66s -> 26088.54s]  You could put all if you didn't have a second phone number
[26088.54s -> 26091.58s]  Didn't want one you could put smurfs up to like a limit
[26091.58s -> 26094.54s]  So you could have like three smurfs or like two smurfs and your main account, right?
[26095.02s -> 26097.02s]  So you could have like three total accounts
[26097.26s -> 26102.06s]  And you you would have to like you could add those to the same like omega account
[26102.30s -> 26104.94s]  Right and that omega account could be your verified account
[26105.26s -> 26110.54s]  Now if any of your accounts get punished on your omega account, all of your accounts get punished
[26115.10s -> 26117.42s]  So if any of your accounts get punished all of them get punished
[26119.50s -> 26121.50s]  You
[26129.82s -> 26131.82s]  Like I feel like that'd be a good play
[26132.14s -> 26136.46s]  Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like it would work. Yo, what's up rush? I call you rush. What's up, raf?
[26140.86s -> 26146.30s]  Uh, what do I want to play? I don't know. I don't know what I want to do here
[26148.86s -> 26154.62s]  It's all arranged. Okay. I wish I didn't have cleanse cleanse is so worthless this game. Wait actually
[26156.54s -> 26158.54s]  Cleanse does nothing this game at all
[26159.26s -> 26165.98s]  I'm just down to some like maybe if the brand like tries to flash stun me or some shit, but I'm just like down a summoner
[26178.86s -> 26182.70s]  All right boys, we got night blue three on our team
[26185.66s -> 26187.66s]  Is a throwback
[26208.54s -> 26210.54s]  You
[26238.54s -> 26240.54s]  You
[26247.98s -> 26249.98s]  Yeah, oh we got him
[26256.06s -> 26258.38s]  I'm not gonna lie. I kind of looked like I was scripting
[26260.38s -> 26264.14s]  That that movement like if I was watching the game I'd be like, what the fuck was that?
[26266.06s -> 26268.06s]  Like my movement was real sus
[26268.54s -> 26273.74s]  Well on that like that all in right there. That's some that's some that's some sus movement
[26299.50s -> 26308.70s]  We can gank these guys they have no oh there's gonna be a ward in here
[26319.18s -> 26324.78s]  These people have no flashes enemy bot lane has no flash this should be be a free kill honestly
[26325.26s -> 26329.98s]  We just let these guys push in they can't walk up and we just play for that
[26335.02s -> 26338.70s]  Even if they try and 3v3 we should just win the 3v3 because we're stronger
[26346.06s -> 26348.06s]  Oh this guy's just dead. Yeah, it's
[26354.78s -> 26359.50s]  I need level three
[26363.10s -> 26367.10s]  I kind of fucked my entire wave here. Yo, can we push?
[26369.58s -> 26371.58s]  Is there any way we can just push this?
[26378.06s -> 26380.06s]  Oh nice
[26385.10s -> 26396.22s]  Nice what played nice job my Lulu's fucking fetish shit
[26404.38s -> 26408.14s]  Oh, I should have gone free boots this game. I didn't think about it
[26408.86s -> 26410.86s]  Cause uh
[26411.74s -> 26415.74s]  I don't need sork this game. You know how like the last game I told you I was going boots
[26416.14s -> 26418.14s]  I went boots for the uh
[26418.54s -> 26422.54s]  You know the fast boot to rush for thresh. I don't need that this game because
[26423.66s -> 26425.66s]  We just went through like faster mythic
[26429.98s -> 26432.94s]  So I should have gone free boots for like more efficiency
[26439.02s -> 26440.14s]  I
[26440.14s -> 26448.54s]  Can't understand and I could just kill a man. You can't understand. I could just kill a man
[26468.14s -> 26472.94s]  I want to push this wave so we don't get like shit on
[26499.02s -> 26506.70s]  And I just kill a man and you can't understand just kill a man
[26511.18s -> 26517.10s]  Kill a man there is something you can't understand kill a man
[26528.14s -> 26530.14s]  I
[26544.78s -> 26548.78s]  Could go back here, but I don't see any reason to go back yet
[26558.62s -> 26560.62s]  I think I'm dead
[26564.30s -> 26565.58s]  Oh
[26565.58s -> 26569.34s]  I misplayed that that was actually really good by lila cool downs. No, you're fine, man
[26569.90s -> 26574.46s]  I wish I could I wish I could tell him that he played it fine. I messed up not him. I messed up
[26576.38s -> 26579.18s]  Ah, I feel bad. I want to like say no, you're fine
[26580.14s -> 26582.14s]  Whatever
[26583.82s -> 26585.74s]  Because that was my bad
[26585.74s -> 26586.54s]  I should have okay
[26586.54s -> 26591.02s]  So when I flashed and I was running away from the twitch right the second that twitch flashed on me
[26591.02s -> 26593.02s]  I should have instantly started autoing him
[26593.50s -> 26598.54s]  Like I it was one extra auto like one single extra auto and it would have been fine
[26601.98s -> 26603.98s]  Why can't I tell her
[26606.22s -> 26608.22s]  You know, I just choose not to type anymore
[26609.18s -> 26611.18s]  It's my choice
[26613.10s -> 26615.10s]  You know
[26615.66s -> 26617.66s]  Yeah
[26620.14s -> 26622.14s]  My choice
[26639.58s -> 26641.58s]  Well that guy's actually doing that, huh?
[26644.62s -> 26649.74s]  We win to be too really fucking hard especially with tier two boots, but I need a
[26665.02s -> 26668.22s]  Dude, I'm doing some scripty shit. I don't be real
[26669.26s -> 26671.26s]  I
[26674.06s -> 26678.62s]  Dude Lulu wasn't six. I thought she was six. I'm so bad
[26681.82s -> 26685.26s]  I wish I could tell her my bad again. I'm actually trolling
[26686.46s -> 26690.70s]  Like I ran out of mana because I'm bad and then I uh
[26693.50s -> 26695.26s]  And then I thought she was six
[26695.34s -> 26699.34s]  So I walked up to like take tank the turret for a second right because I was like, oh, shit
[26699.34s -> 26702.06s]  Maybe I'll get like maybe we can kill this guy. Maybe Lulu has a spell or something
[26702.78s -> 26704.78s]  I just oh, I played bad my bad
[26710.78s -> 26713.02s]  W that make sure echo's not there
[26718.30s -> 26722.86s]  I feel I actually just feel so bad because the Lulu is actually playing really this is like the best support I've had all day
[26723.66s -> 26727.26s]  Like this guy's actually impressing me, right? Like this guy's playing really well
[26732.70s -> 26734.70s]  And I'm just griefing
[26752.86s -> 26754.86s]  I
[26760.86s -> 26762.86s]  Gave her life for me
[26765.74s -> 26767.74s]  Lulu gave her life for me boys
[26769.74s -> 26774.46s]  Can we get a salute for Lulu and chat boys? Do we get a salute?
[26776.94s -> 26778.94s]  Can we get some love for Lulu?
[26780.14s -> 26782.14s]  She gave her life
[26783.10s -> 26785.10s]  I
[26787.90s -> 26789.90s]  For the homie
[26803.90s -> 26806.86s]  Honestly that was a really cool 2v2 by the way
[26807.82s -> 26812.62s]  Oh, oh night was smurfing it. What the fuck? Yo kill that bitch, too
[26829.66s -> 26831.66s]  Nice
[26837.82s -> 26839.82s]  Oh
[26843.26s -> 26846.86s]  If I lost that cannon I would have lost my life in game
[26866.86s -> 26868.86s]  Uh
[26876.78s -> 26881.66s]  I'm gonna go BT second item we have Lulu. Uh, so wait, what the fuck is this pathing?
[26883.34s -> 26886.30s]  I clicked to go bot and it passed me in the weirdest spot ever we have Lulu
[26886.70s -> 26891.42s]  So I could actually go ie second, but I think if I go BT I'll be actually unkillable
[26892.94s -> 26894.94s]  Like it'll be the greatest thing ever
[26897.10s -> 26902.14s]  I actually still might go ie as I'm thinking about it that loud by saying we have Lulu and not be stupid, but hey
[26902.94s -> 26909.10s]  Like I still might you know, I still might go ie, but I don't know yet. We'll see because I took a lacrity. So it's like
[26912.54s -> 26914.54s]  Wow
[26914.54s -> 26916.54s]  So
[26925.34s -> 26927.34s]  No
[26944.54s -> 26946.54s]  I
[26949.26s -> 26951.26s]  Mean I don't know why I flashed away
[26953.26s -> 26955.66s]  I'm playing bad. That's my fault
[26957.26s -> 26961.66s]  I think the game's over. So I'm just I'm playing bad. I'm like limit testing a little bit too much
[26961.66s -> 26963.66s]  I
[26972.70s -> 26974.70s]  Today
[26991.66s -> 26994.62s]  Hey
[27021.66s -> 27024.38s]  I
[27052.06s -> 27054.06s]  I
[27055.66s -> 27063.10s]  Surprised they haven't for put it though. What the fuck dude, how does this game? Oh, I'm even more mad. You guys have no idea
[27064.46s -> 27066.46s]  So I
[27067.02s -> 27070.38s]  It's 24 to 8 the enemy team doesn't forfeit
[27071.10s -> 27073.98s]  But my team for fits when the score is 10 to 14
[27075.66s -> 27077.66s]  And we're only down a thousand golds
[27081.66s -> 27083.66s]  So
[27095.66s -> 27099.34s]  Sorry, I was that was my bad I was tilted by uh
[27101.82s -> 27105.58s]  You know, I was thinking about about how uh, they weren't forfeiting and I was getting mad
[27107.34s -> 27109.74s]  It is a little interesting because like I said, they still can't win
[27110.30s -> 27115.18s]  So I don't know who the fuck's heading no, but it's probably echo. Well, no echo is definitely heading no, but like who else?
[27117.10s -> 27119.10s]  Maybe brand
[27121.42s -> 27123.58s]  Maybe ribbon maybe ribbon's like, yeah
[27127.50s -> 27129.50s]  They did just get a thousand gold
[27132.46s -> 27134.46s]  All right, I should probably stop trolling
[27134.62s -> 27136.62s]  I
[27137.18s -> 27139.18s]  Feel pretty silly if we lost because I'm bad
[27139.90s -> 27144.22s]  After we like dumpster them and laying that hard. I feel pretty silly if we lost because I keep getting caught
[27161.82s -> 27163.82s]  All right, I should be unkillable now
[27165.42s -> 27167.90s]  Like I'm not even farming I'm actually griefing
[27168.86s -> 27170.86s]  I should probably go make dinner after this game
[27171.18s -> 27175.42s]  I want to keep playing because I'm playing well today, but like dude my brain is starting to go like
[27176.14s -> 27178.14s]  Like I probably need to go make some food
[27178.38s -> 27180.86s]  I'm getting the full ADHD brain experience going
[27180.86s -> 27196.14s]  So, let's see if I can muster all my focus
[27200.62s -> 27205.50s]  Let's see if I can muster up all my focus really quick just for push out and finish this game
[27206.22s -> 27215.10s]  We'll go terminator mode for the the end of this game right now. We'll muster up all of the all of the focus
[27224.22s -> 27227.26s]  Demon mode engaged boys god that sounded really cringe
[27235.50s -> 27237.50s]  You
[27266.06s -> 27268.06s]  You
[27277.58s -> 27280.54s]  I'm actually really impressed though night blue played this game really really well
[27282.62s -> 27287.90s]  Like I'll be honest my last like thought of night blue was him being bad at league
[27289.50s -> 27291.58s]  He played this game really well
[27291.58s -> 27296.06s]  my man's gotten so much better
[27303.42s -> 27308.94s]  Okay, nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody, nobody saw that nobody saw that
[27308.94s -> 27313.34s]  Nobody saw that nobody saw that not one of you saw me flash after the equal didn't not one of you
[27321.58s -> 27324.22s]  Wasted Flash? No, that was Assertive Flash.
[27324.78s -> 27327.18s]  An Assertive Dominant Flash.
[27327.98s -> 27329.68s]  Not wasted at all.
[27335.68s -> 27337.48s]  They might actually go for Baron here.
[27337.78s -> 27339.28s]  We should look for this.
[27340.88s -> 27342.48s]  Like they could try. Oh, he's here.
[27349.68s -> 27351.48s]  Pretty sure the ribbon's here too though.
[27352.58s -> 27353.58s]  Yup.
[27353.98s -> 27355.48s]  I did not mean to do that.
[27356.18s -> 27359.18s]  I didn't mean to hit the thing. I accidentally hit the blast plants.
[27360.58s -> 27363.68s]  That was an accident. It was a literal pure accident.
[27366.48s -> 27367.48s]  Like I...
[27368.18s -> 27370.28s]  I did not mean to hit it. I was like...
[27370.38s -> 27373.68s]  I know ribbon's here. I'm gonna wait for Yasuo before I go over.
[27373.78s -> 27375.98s]  Or before I do this, right? And I'm gonna bait him.
[27376.08s -> 27379.18s]  And I just completely whiffed every... Like I'm bad.
[27379.48s -> 27381.88s]  We'll leave it at... I'm bad. That's a good way to put it. I'm bad.
[27382.38s -> 27384.68s]  I'm hungry. I'm old. I'm bald. I'm bad.
[27384.98s -> 27385.98s]  Nothing else to say.
[27387.08s -> 27388.68s]  Short too. Short and mad.
[27402.78s -> 27405.48s]  Yeah, that was a pedestrian flash.
[27406.48s -> 27409.18s]  It is she as well. Oh, yeah. It's a plethora.
[27409.28s -> 27412.18s]  A plethora of terrible things.
[27416.48s -> 27418.28s]  I still gotta go to the gym tonight too.
[27435.48s -> 27448.08s]  Zed's bot. Okay. I'm a little nervous of like getting flanked.
[27449.38s -> 27451.68s]  Right? Their junglers could just like sit in places.
[27466.48s -> 27468.48s]  Nice. We got top and hit him. Not bad.
[27469.48s -> 27471.48s]  Yeah. I mean, we just try and get mid and hit there.
[27472.98s -> 27474.48s]  Well, let's go help our homie though.
[27496.48s -> 27500.48s]  Like I'm actually so sad. I'm playing so bad.
[27501.48s -> 27504.48s]  Like I was playing so good at the start and now I'm playing so bad.
[27504.98s -> 27506.48s]  That actually makes me sad.
[27515.48s -> 27517.48s]  I was tanking for that guy.
[27526.48s -> 27530.48s]  Alright, let's just leave.
[27538.48s -> 27549.48s]  I don't want to throw the game for my teammates because I'm getting like, you know, I've already died five times like a dipshit.
[27556.48s -> 27560.48s]  I'm trying to get out.
[27574.48s -> 27575.48s]  Oh, where'd he go?
[27581.48s -> 27583.48s]  We should just push bot, honestly.
[27584.48s -> 27586.48s]  We don't even need this dragon.
[27595.48s -> 27598.48s]  Okay, we should. I'm just gonna push bot.
[27613.48s -> 27614.48s]  Okay.
[27644.48s -> 27645.48s]  Not bad.
[27658.48s -> 27663.48s]  Not bad at all. I got to give it. I want to give it to night blue, but I got to give it to this Lulu.
[27664.48s -> 27666.48s]  Lulu played that game so good.
[27668.48s -> 27671.48s]  I got to give it to Lulu. She played so fucking good.
[27674.48s -> 27677.48s]  Like, actually.
[27692.48s -> 27694.48s]  I don't even know if she's still in here.
[27703.48s -> 27704.48s]  I don't know.
[27712.48s -> 27714.48s]  I'm not a scripter.
[27721.48s -> 27724.48s]  She thinks I'm a... No, I'm serious.
[27725.48s -> 27727.48s]  She thinks I'm a scripter.
[27732.48s -> 27734.48s]  Bro, I'm streaming.
[27734.48s -> 27736.48s]  Bro, I'm streaming.
[27759.48s -> 27761.48s]  Dude, the homie thought I'm a scripter.
[27762.48s -> 27766.48s]  You know, I'll take it. My ego feels good.
[27775.48s -> 27777.48s]  Honestly, that feels good. That feels good.
[27778.48s -> 27779.48s]  Hi, Vol.
[27783.48s -> 27785.48s]  Thought I was a scripter. Dude, I'm not gonna lie though.
[27785.48s -> 27789.48s]  Some of those movements were sus as fuck that I was making.
[27790.48s -> 27794.48s]  I turned on the fucking mental scripts for that game.
[27794.48s -> 27797.48s]  Some of those movements early were nuts.
[27799.48s -> 27806.48s]  Just like this tiny little movements I was doing early game and lame were crazy.
[27806.48s -> 27808.48s]  Look at this. Watch this.
[27808.48s -> 27810.48s]  This movement right here, right? Look.
[27815.48s -> 27817.48s]  I dodged that, right?
[27817.48s -> 27821.48s]  Then I walk up, cleanse the thing, kite down.
[27826.48s -> 27829.48s]  Like that? That movement is gross, man.
[27829.48s -> 27830.48s]  Look.
[27832.48s -> 27835.48s]  That was actually some gross ass movement. I'm not gonna lie.
[27835.48s -> 27837.48s]  Look at this.
[27837.48s -> 27841.48s]  In the corner, man. In the corner.
[27843.48s -> 27844.48s]  My brain was like...
[27848.48s -> 27851.48s]  Yo, Andromeda, thank you, man. Yo, you played really good.
[27851.48s -> 27855.48s]  Now, I felt bad. I felt so bad because I was griefing.
[27855.48s -> 27856.48s]  Like, I was...
[27856.48s -> 27859.48s]  Like, at the start of the game, we were just snow...
[27859.48s -> 27864.48s]  Like, I literally fucked up like three times during like the really important fights.
[27864.48s -> 27865.48s]  And I was like, oh, no.
[27869.48s -> 27871.48s]  Yo, thank you for the beds.
[27871.48s -> 27873.48s]  Can I play Galista? I can.
[27877.48s -> 27882.48s]  I'm trying to figure out if I want to play a Galista game or if I want to go make dinner.
[27888.48s -> 27891.48s]  There was one other movement that I thought was kind of nuts.
[27891.48s -> 27895.48s]  I did a really good movement to somewhere. I don't remember what it was.
[27898.48s -> 27899.48s]  Here's where I fucked up.
[27899.48s -> 27902.48s]  So right now, I should have just been...
[27902.48s -> 27906.48s]  For some reason, my brain lagged, and I should have just been sitting here.
[27907.48s -> 27910.48s]  I should have just cleansed and then started fighting the Twitch.
[27910.48s -> 27914.48s]  For some reason, I didn't cleanse, but this wasn't like your fault at all.
[27914.48s -> 27918.48s]  Like, the second the Twitch flashed, I should have insta-cleansed the Ignite,
[27918.48s -> 27921.48s]  and I should have just been killing him, like right now, just like auto-ing.
[27921.48s -> 27923.48s]  Because I can't get away from him, right?
[27923.48s -> 27926.48s]  But it took me an extra second. See how I started fighting him now?
[27929.48s -> 27935.48s]  Like, I barely died. I wouldn't have died had I cleansed and had I just turned initially.
[27935.48s -> 27936.48s]  It was fine.
[27938.48s -> 27943.48s]  And then like here, I fucked up too.
[27943.48s -> 27946.48s]  Because I went in and I thought we were six.
[27954.48s -> 27956.48s]  Oh, I could have killed that guy.
[27956.48s -> 27959.48s]  I should have gone forward one more.
[27959.48s -> 27961.48s]  Oh, you know what I should have done there?
[27961.48s -> 27963.48s]  I should have gone forward one more auto, killed this guy.
[27963.48s -> 27966.48s]  Lulu would have gotten six off of the kill.
[27966.48s -> 27968.48s]  I would have used my speed to come back out.
[27968.48s -> 27972.48s]  Then she could have ulted me. We could have killed the Twitch,
[27972.48s -> 27974.48s]  and then we could have turned on this Echo too.
[27981.48s -> 27984.48s]  Oh, this was a really cool 2v2.
[27985.48s -> 27987.48s]  I actually thought this 2v2 was really sick.
[27992.48s -> 27994.48s]  Lulu's a real one for this, man.
[27994.48s -> 27996.48s]  Listen, you're a real one for this one.
[27997.48s -> 27999.48s]  You just took the death to save me.
[28004.48s -> 28005.48s]  Respect.
[28006.48s -> 28007.48s]  You're a real one for that.
[28012.48s -> 28013.48s]  That was so good.
[28019.48s -> 28022.48s]  Jesus was fun. Yeah, geez. You were the best support I've had today.
[28022.48s -> 28025.48s]  Legitimately, you played better than all the other players in the SEALA.
[28025.48s -> 28027.48s]  That was really good.
[28027.48s -> 28029.48s]  I was surprised. I was telling my streamer, I was like, yeah.
[28029.48s -> 28033.48s]  She's actually like, they, I said she because you're a Lulu.
[28033.48s -> 28034.48s]  I don't know.
[28034.48s -> 28035.48s]  But I was like, yeah.
[28035.48s -> 28037.48s]  She's playing super good.
[28037.48s -> 28039.48s]  She's playing way better than all of my fucking teammates.
[28044.48s -> 28047.48s]  Yo, what time is it? It's six?
[28048.48s -> 28053.48s]  Man, do I want to, do I want to keep streaming or do I want to go to, or do I want to go get food and go to the gym?
[28055.48s -> 28058.48s]  I can't like 24 hour fitness is not actually 24 anymore.
[28059.48s -> 28062.48s]  So I'd have to go soon if I'm going to go to the gym.
[28066.48s -> 28068.48s]  But it is only like six.
[28078.48s -> 28079.48s]  Hmm.
[28081.48s -> 28083.48s]  But I could just end on.
[28084.48s -> 28088.48s]  I could just end on the hitting the like 400 LP mark and just chill for now.
[28091.48s -> 28094.48s]  Right. Like we had 400 LP. We'll probably hit GM tomorrow.
[28095.48s -> 28098.48s]  So I could just chill for now and then we can just hit GM tomorrow.
[28101.48s -> 28104.48s]  That's probably a better idea because then I won't get mad.
[28104.48s -> 28107.48s]  Like say we get like, like say we get another game like this, right?
[28109.48s -> 28114.48s]  Like say we get another game like this where like we're literally winning the game and my team's like, no, let's forfeit.
[28114.48s -> 28117.48s]  Like that's going to make me mad. I was mad. This is going to make me mad.
[28117.48s -> 28120.48s]  Right. Like I so I'd rather just like get off on a good note.
[28120.48s -> 28122.48s]  Like a happy note, you know, like not be tilted.
[28129.48s -> 28131.48s]  GM tomorrow. Yeah, I hope so.
[28131.48s -> 28135.48s]  And I think I can get challenger back this year, but we got to get to GM first.
[28136.48s -> 28138.48s]  I'm telling you, this elo is so miserable.
[28139.48s -> 28148.48s]  Like master tier is the worst elo I've ever played in in my 12 years of playing this game.
[28149.48s -> 28155.48s]  Whatever NA 300 400 LP masters is is literally disgusting.
[28156.48s -> 28158.48s]  These these are not real people.
[28158.48s -> 28168.48s]  Like I feel like half these games we are playing with NPCs who quite literally don't even like I don't even know what to say.
[28168.48s -> 28171.48s]  They're bots and they can't be real humans.
[28171.48s -> 28172.48s]  They get mad over nothing.
[28172.48s -> 28174.48s]  They rage quit over nothing.
[28174.48s -> 28178.48s]  They give up at 15 minutes when we're winning the game.
[28178.48s -> 28180.48s]  These cannot be real people.
[28182.48s -> 28186.48s]  So I swear to God, the game has to get better in GM.
[28186.48s -> 28188.48s]  It has to get better.
[28188.48s -> 28191.48s]  There's no world that it gets worse.
[28192.48s -> 28198.48s]  Like I refuse to believe that because this is this is the worst grind I've ever had.
[28202.48s -> 28203.48s]  Is it bad to be a bot?
[28206.48s -> 28207.48s]  Are you saying I'm boticed?
[28209.48s -> 28212.48s]  Are you gonna cancel me because I because I don't like bots?
[28212.48s -> 28213.48s]  I said it.
[28213.48s -> 28214.48s]  I'm saying it.
[28214.48s -> 28215.48s]  I don't like fucking bots.
[28216.48s -> 28217.48s]  Whoa.
[28217.48s -> 28218.48s]  Okay, I didn't need to add fuck.
[28218.48s -> 28219.48s]  You know what?
[28219.48s -> 28220.48s]  I'm gonna get off.
[28220.48s -> 28221.48s]  I'm gonna.
[28221.48s -> 28222.48s]  Yeah, that's it.
[28222.48s -> 28223.48s]  That's it for me.
[28223.48s -> 28224.48s]  I'm gonna get off voice.
[28224.48s -> 28225.48s]  I'm tired.
[28225.48s -> 28227.48s]  I need to go to the gym before I run out of juice.
[28227.48s -> 28229.48s]  Make some dinner.
[28229.48s -> 28230.48s]  I will be live tomorrow.
[28230.48s -> 28231.48s]  Same time as today.
[28231.48s -> 28233.48s]  I've been starting my stream at 10 a.m.
[28233.48s -> 28234.48s]  My time.
[28234.48s -> 28238.48s]  Maybe I'll do it tomorrow at 9 a.m.
[28238.48s -> 28239.48s]  I don't know.
[28239.48s -> 28240.48s]  It's 10 or 9.
[28240.48s -> 28241.48s]  Between there, I always start my stream.
[28241.48s -> 28244.48s]  And so, and that's my time.
[28244.48s -> 28247.48s]  So it's like seven, eight, nine PST.
[28247.48s -> 28248.48s]  You're good at 80.
[28248.48s -> 28249.48s]  Thanks, man.
[28249.48s -> 28250.48s]  I think I suck.
[28250.48s -> 28254.48s]  My goal is hopefully I can get Challenger back.
[28254.48s -> 28257.48s]  And then I'm not gonna play.
[28257.48s -> 28261.48s]  Like I just want to my goal is Challenger so that I can prove to myself.
[28261.48s -> 28267.48s]  It's a really stupid thing, but I want to prove to myself that I can still do it at 32.
[28267.48s -> 28270.48s]  Because 10 years ago was the first time I started streaming this year.
[28270.48s -> 28272.48s]  I've been streaming for 10 years this year.
[28272.48s -> 28274.48s]  And so I want to get Challenger.
[28274.48s -> 28281.48s]  Because when I first started streaming, I was in Challenger and I want to see if like after 10 years I can still do it.
[28281.48s -> 28284.48s]  And then I'm never gonna care again.
[28284.48s -> 28287.48s]  This will be the only time I ever give a shit about getting Challenger.
[28287.48s -> 28292.48s]  I just want to get it, see if I care, and then play for content, you know.
[28292.48s -> 28294.48s]  But yeah, it's just like personal stuff.
[28294.48s -> 28297.48s]  Welcome to the League of Draven.
[28297.48s -> 28304.48s]  See if the old man who has fucking arthritis and fucking carpal tunnel and all that shit, you know what I mean?
[28304.48s -> 28306.48s]  See if I can still do it.
[28306.48s -> 28310.48s]  Yo, thank you for the Twitch Prime, man. I appreciate it. Thank you so much.
[28310.48s -> 28312.48s]  Appreciate it a lot, dude.
[28312.48s -> 28318.48s]  Alright guys, that's gonna be it for me. If you like to stream, don't forget to follow all my socials and TikTok and Facebook and Instagram and all that shit.
[28318.48s -> 28322.48s]  All the clickable garbage is underneath the stream. Don't forget to check it out.
[28322.48s -> 28325.48s]  I'll be back tomorrow, same time in the morning.
[28325.48s -> 28329.48s]  Tomorrow's my last day for the weekend, though. I'm not gonna stream on Saturday.
[28329.48s -> 28332.48s]  I might do some off-stream grinding on Saturday.
[28332.48s -> 28338.48s]  I've been like forcing myself to take a day off of streaming every week, just so I can mentally recharge.
[28338.48s -> 28341.48s]  And I think it's actually been really good for my stream.
[28341.48s -> 28345.48s]  Because I've been in a much better mood while streaming, and I've been much less tilted.
[28345.48s -> 28351.48s]  And I've been, even if I play League off-stream or whatever, it doesn't feel as forced.
[28351.48s -> 28355.48s]  I feel like the break's nice. So yeah, tomorrow, no stream on Saturday. Tomorrow for sure.
[28355.48s -> 28358.48s]  And Sunday, I might do a short stream.
[28358.48s -> 28363.48s]  But yeah, I'll see you guys then. Thanks for watching. I appreciate it, guys.
[28363.48s -> 28368.48s]  And yeah, that's it. I'm gonna go make dinner.
[28368.48s -> 28371.48s]  Oh, we guys have a good night. Day, wherever the fuck you are.
[28371.48s -> 28375.48s]  Later, dudes. Hope you guys have a good one. It was fun playing with Andromeda.
[28375.48s -> 28377.48s]  Go look on the games.
[28377.48s -> 28380.48s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow. Peace.
