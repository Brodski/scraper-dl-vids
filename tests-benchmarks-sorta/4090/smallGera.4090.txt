[190.19s -> 195.62s]  Yeah, that guy has
[195.76s -> 196.98s]  GP
[196.98s -> 215.42s]  Bees
[215.42s -> 254.07s]  Jesus
[254.09s -> 270.75s]  Yo, it was a man. What's up dudes?
[318.94s -> 320.94s]  Yeah, I mean we're hoping
[321.20s -> 327.59s]  We'll see man. We'll see
[330.25s -> 391.51s]  Fingers fucking crossed right? Do I ever actually?
[392.15s -> 408.19s]  I'm wondering if I I'm assuming I'm just playing a math
[462.42s -> 463.74s]  Yay
[463.74s -> 484.16s]  Yes, it's probably just me doing fucking. I'm probably just doing star guardian
[498.34s -> 502.08s]  Welcome to the room for the 27 months man
[503.50s -> 530.98s]  Appreciate it a lot dude. Thank you, and I could probably still go infinite team, but so I'm holding the solution
[531.72s -> 533.72s]  But I haven't seen any severs or anything
[534.80s -> 619.95s]  So it'd be kind of awkward, you know this guy's definitely gonna beat me that guys I
[621.03s -> 625.19s]  See why he hasn't lost that's he has five infinity team already Jesus Christ. I
[626.31s -> 628.95s]  Was like man, why is that guy so strong and then I like realized
[629.55s -> 780.80s]  So I go to seven next rounds and then hopefully we can hit
[782.14s -> 806.32s]  Some shit I kind of like this actually because now we can make I
[807.60s -> 809.28s]  can actually make a
[809.28s -> 811.28s]  Guard breaker and I could also make
[811.76s -> 848.94s]  We go like guard breaker and math. I kind of want to just ionic spark, but I don't know if I should I need
[850.32s -> 852.32s]  an echo a
[852.40s -> 854.40s]  Niko or a round
[854.40s -> 857.40s]  I also could use an Ezreal. I need like a quick draw.
[858.40s -> 876.02s]  I should have kept that Lucian from earlier.
[876.02s -> 880.02s]  He's got a level 3 Blitzcrank and he's just so fucking strong it's stupid.
[880.02s -> 950.92s]  This is really interesting.
[950.92s -> 975.23s]  I guess I could go Spell Singer as well.
[975.23s -> 978.23s]  And we can just give the Shiv to TF.
[978.23s -> 1007.98s]  We can just do this for now too.
[1007.98s -> 1037.21s]  I guess I could use...
[1037.21s -> 1042.18s]  I could do Jeweled Gauntlet.
[1042.18s -> 1044.50s]  I don't know.
[1044.50s -> 1048.51s]  Could Jeweled Gauntlet this shit up?
[1048.51s -> 1104.89s]  See how it goes. I need to like throw an item down
[1105.93s -> 1108.09s]  But I feel like morellos is bad
[1108.45s -> 1128.60s]  I guess I could just use hat or like I said before jeweled gauntlet could be good. I don't know I
[1128.86s -> 1154.02s]  Could just roll on seven to try and three star stuff. This guy has three kaisa's though
[1154.54s -> 1156.30s]  This guy has one kaisa
[1156.30s -> 1161.86s]  Kind of hard to three-star kaisa. I could three-star Nyla
[1162.62s -> 1193.10s]  They're gonna sell eight with fucking 20 gold
[1193.10s -> 1297.81s]  Here he has MF and dude Blitzcrank is insane.
[1297.81s -> 1357.48s]  Dude that gnar just merked me.
[1357.48s -> 1371.58s]  I did not position for the gnar and I got fucked for it.
[1371.58s -> 1399.18s]  This motherfucker.
[1399.18s -> 1404.18s]  Dude I wish I could get some thick front line leveled up.
[1404.18s -> 1458.67s]  That'd be cool.
[1458.67s -> 1542.31s]  Oh my god, another NAR.
[1542.31s -> 1543.83s]  Well, rip.
[1543.83s -> 1546.43s]  I was gonna go MF and then I decided to go Niko
[1546.43s -> 1548.27s]  and then I just fucked it all up.
[1548.27s -> 1551.41s]  Oh well.
[1551.41s -> 1571.58s]  Oh well.
[1571.58s -> 1572.62s]  Time is at 10.
[1597.78s -> 1598.62s]  Oh.
[1619.19s -> 1621.07s]  What's up, boys?
[1621.07s -> 1634.70s]  How's everybody doing?
[1634.70s -> 1643.42s]  Oh, I'll be right back.
[1643.42s -> 1646.82s]  Sorry, I'm still waking up, let me give me one sec.
[1646.82s -> 1647.66s]  Sub-Sky.
[1649.26s -> 1674.94s]  Oh.
[1674.94s -> 1676.70s]  Oh, okay.
[1676.70s -> 1679.80s]  Woo.
[1679.80s -> 1681.04s]  Oh yeah, baby.
[1681.04s -> 1683.40s]  I was gonna play on my main at the start, but dude,
[1683.40s -> 1684.24s]  I don't know if I can sit through
[1684.24s -> 1685.80s]  fucking eight minute queue times
[1685.80s -> 1687.92s]  to get people raging at each other all day.
[1687.92s -> 1702.74s]  So we'll do some warm up on this account for a bit.
[1702.74s -> 1704.06s]  What, a Mars account?
[1704.06s -> 1713.58s]  Like, D1 Woe Master.
[1713.58s -> 1715.54s]  Like, my other account's like 500.
[1715.54s -> 1717.98s]  This one's, I wanna say like,
[1717.98s -> 1719.98s]  I don't know, the MMR's really awkward.
[1719.98s -> 1723.30s]  Uh when you get like low masters right like they are more super awkward
[1723.60s -> 1729.66s]  So I don't know what they have more is but I know it's low masters. So like sometimes there's diamonds sometimes. There's like hundred LP players
[1731.14s -> 1732.70s]  somewhere between there
[1732.70s -> 1744.66s]  Dude, I I played some games off stream yesterday. I got up to like 400 LP
[1745.76s -> 1747.76s]  Then I lost three in a row
[1748.08s -> 1759.10s]  That shit was painful. I did into one of tenacity's games though. So that was fun
[1759.10s -> 1774.10s]  that felt bad no yes straight up it felt so bad he was doing so good to like I
[1774.10s -> 1780.25s]  straight up just had a bad game and I felt I felt like shit look at this shit
[1780.25s -> 1784.13s]  I just dropped like eight deaths look at the shits
[1784.57s -> 1790.33s]  but he was just straight up smurfing on the enemy top laner and we all the
[1790.33s -> 1795.86s]  entire team just like decided to collectively run it down but we all
[1795.86s -> 1808.97s]  just got shit on this was a really weird game because I feel like that game was
[1808.97s -> 1812.81s]  like the first game I felt everybody in the game was like actually high GM
[1812.81s -> 1817.45s]  challenger but they weren't right at that there's a very weird system going on
[1817.45s -> 1831.80s]  let's do a Cassiopeia game like I'll show you guys what I mean in a second
[1831.80s -> 1848.51s]  I'm assuming I should go this right this is probably good or this that's
[1848.51s -> 1860.82s]  forget to oh well okay so yeah we'll get this stuff like Neon Tonso is like
[1860.82s -> 1864.82s]  he's been challenger for a long time right I don't even know who the fuck
[1864.82s -> 1870.90s]  this guy was some random Senna player who's like not playing Senna now and
[1870.90s -> 1878.46s]  then this guy was like trying to jungle and just like running it down it was I
[1878.46s -> 1882.30s]  don't even know it was the weirdest game that I've played in a while
[1882.82s -> 1885.58s]  Cuz like my ad carry wasn't bad
[1886.38s -> 1890.62s]  Like this guy's clearly like on a smurf, but I don't know how good he was cuz he wasn't bad at the game
[1892.14s -> 1894.14s]  The enemy ad carry wasn't bad
[1895.10s -> 1900.58s]  This guy's also on a smurf. It was the weirdest lobby. It was like a bunch of smurf accounts
[1901.10s -> 1909.77s]  All playing with each other, but it was like a non-smurf queue. This guy was like the only non-smurf
[1910.25s -> 1925.01s]  It was interesting. Ooh, do I take ghost here or do I just?
[1925.01s -> 1930.73s]  I've had ghosts could be really OP versus their team with Cassiopeia, but maybe I should just take
[1931.17s -> 1940.24s]  I'm gonna try it. Oh
[1940.56s -> 1946.66s]  Somebody dodged cuz yeah, I don't I never know I never know if I should take ghost ignite whatever
[1948.50s -> 1954.66s]  Cuz I feel like ghosts with Cassio's feels like the same thing's AD carry, right same idea where it feels really OP
[1963.32s -> 1974.66s]  Dude, there's so much drama going on in the league community yet again. By the way, it's it's insane
[1974.66s -> 2008.02s]  yeah I don't know man I I just I'm I like I like looking at drama cuz like
[2008.02s -> 2016.08s]  drama is juicy like I like looking at drama but it's also like how are people
[2016.08s -> 2039.26s]  so stupid yeah I'm getting like I don't know man my view on all of this shit is
[2039.26s -> 2046.74s]  like I I guess I'm just not hardwired that way I can't mentally wrap my head
[2046.74s -> 2057.12s]  around being excited to flirt with underage girls or like when I just I never had the
[2057.12s -> 2067.83s]  want like it happens so much between like league streamers and non like just it's not even
[2067.83s -> 2071.03s]  a league thing it's just that we're in the league community right so you see it more
[2071.03s -> 2077.91s]  dude like well the drama is like a decent sized league streamer who is like getting bigger
[2077.91s -> 2081.87s]  or whatever like the ad carry streamer cookie roll or whatever he was like
[2082.47s -> 2084.47s]  Somebody made a 90 page
[2086.03s -> 2088.03s]  90 pages of
[2088.41s -> 2094.40s]  Google Doc to basically like expose this guy for like
[2095.16s -> 2097.52s]  Talking a bunch like sexually to underage girls
[2098.16s -> 2103.60s]  Not paying his fucking like mods who do work for him and like other stuff, and I'm like, dude
[2111.68s -> 2113.48s]  Yeah, how man
[2113.48s -> 2124.12s]  Like just be a normal human. It's not that bad like I take it for me being a normal dude
[2124.12s -> 2203.81s]  It's not that bad. Sorry. I was distracted. No, uh, yeah, I don't know man
[2203.81s -> 2208.17s]  I I swear to God people are just stupid as fuck people were idiots
[2210.13s -> 2215.61s]  There's got to be some psychological underlying issue with people's brains not working, but it is what it is
[2216.25s -> 2221.26s]  Huh, I've had this market account for a while
[2221.26s -> 2223.26s]  Oh
[2228.73s -> 2237.54s]  Dude what is that tarik skin you see this we just tarik skin man. He's fabulous
[2238.66s -> 2240.66s]  good day
[2240.66s -> 2242.66s]  My man's just straight up fabulous
[2256.38s -> 2258.38s]  People are desperate. I
[2258.58s -> 2263.90s]  Just can't like I don't think like I've been in the situation where I was like a really really big streamer
[2264.34s -> 2268.90s]  Like much bigger than he is and I got like I this is what I'm saying
[2268.90s -> 2275.46s]  is like I understand like all of the crap that gets thrown at you like people will literally
[2275.46s -> 2280.94s]  message you for no reason like you do have like fans that have like when I was at my
[2280.94s -> 2286.62s]  biggest point like you have fans that are younger girls guy it doesn't matter and like you just
[2286.62s -> 2290.34s]  gotta like I just never in my mind I guess thought like oh I'm gonna flirt with these
[2290.34s -> 2295.02s]  people like it made me like I don't even I wouldn't even I literally didn't even
[2295.02s -> 2308.40s]  see them as like sexual in my brain like it blows my mind and then the fact that
[2308.40s -> 2314.00s]  like if you if you look at the Google Doc or whatever the fact that like taco
[2314.00s -> 2317.36s]  like I keep a taco whatever it was literally talking to him telling him he
[2317.36s -> 2320.16s]  was doing it like what he was doing was wrong he was like yeah I get it right
[2320.16s -> 2338.22s]  then he did it again dude the set alting the pussy that that I'll be on
[2338.22s -> 2340.38s]  That may be one of the funniest lines I've ever heard
[2355.10s -> 2359.02s]  Like dude, I mean whatever you know, I'm not here to kink shame whatever gets people off
[2359.02s -> 2362.42s]  You know, maybe maybe maybe that's a fetish. I don't know
[2394.89s -> 2399.68s]  Safe and sounds either way
[2401.08s -> 2403.08s]  Don't worry. We cannot talk about the drama real quick
[2403.84s -> 2405.84s]  We can talk about
[2406.84s -> 2427.27s]  How old and washed up wings of death is though I'm kidding
[2432.47s -> 2434.91s]  Yo, did you see on a glider note though? Did you see riot?
[2435.95s -> 2442.39s]  There was like a reddit thread or something where riot was saying that they're like gonna try and do something about smurfing in the next few months
[2442.39s -> 2445.77s]  I don't know what that means
[2447.61s -> 2448.69s]  But
[2448.69s -> 2460.93s]  Can you tell us something involving wings just between us? Yeah, yeah just between us and all the homies. Yeah
[2460.93s -> 2463.69s]  Chat yeah, and nobody else say anything. It's fine. Yeah, no
[2467.26s -> 2478.86s]  What's up?
[2478.86s -> 2503.46s]  My chatting snitches when I was a teen I made a montage of him having breakdowns in my games. Oh my god
[2504.22s -> 2506.22s]  That's amazing. Oh
[2510.38s -> 2517.10s]  My god, that's amazing. I feel like I need to pay you to see this montage
[2518.14s -> 2520.14s]  Like I will give you money
[2521.42s -> 2546.93s]  Like I need this this is important to me. Oh, I have dude you should see that
[2546.93s -> 2549.69s]  I have so many rage compilations about me. It's crazy
[2550.71s -> 2555.19s]  so many I
[2555.19s -> 2567.37s]  Had a I had a villain arc for sure. I feel you just comes with like being a lead streamer
[2567.87s -> 2577.38s]  But you players are not all mentally healthy. Let me let me tell you
[2580.98s -> 2592.01s]  Take it from me and okay. I'd like to think I'm not a villain anymore
[2592.81s -> 2607.74s]  Fuck you. I really want this plate
[2607.74s -> 2629.94s]  Nice. Dude, Anivia's roaming. Why is there Wukong just sitting top by the way? That's actually hilarious.
[2629.94s -> 2647.82s]  You know what's interesting? I feel like Taric actually missed that stun. I was kind of side-eyeing
[2647.82s -> 2673.50s]  that, but I feel like he missed that stun somehow. I feel like this is the easiest game I've ever
[2673.50s -> 2679.42s]  played by the way. I'm on full autopilot, brain still waking up, and I feel like they're
[2679.42s -> 2683.38s]  just walking into me on repeat I'm just killing them all I don't even know what
[2683.38s -> 2688.42s]  the fuck's going on like they it feels like the enemy team has not like they
[2688.42s -> 2691.98s]  didn't they didn't like understand we were playing league right like they
[2691.98s -> 2695.92s]  queued up and they were like oh yeah this is league that's what this feels
[2695.92s -> 2700.50s]  like this is what I imagine if like Mike Tyson went into a preschool you
[2700.50s -> 2734.14s]  know what I mean like this is what this feels like much say I probably
[2734.14s -> 2748.23s]  could have killed those guys but I don't want to the chill I'm assuming the
[2748.23s -> 2765.55s]  wukong is gonna come bot soon there is damn it I quins late I actually kill
[2765.55s -> 2773.39s]  both that was a late quins by me my bed I don't want to take the risk of my
[2773.39s -> 2778.79s]  backup she stuns me they get one shot me I should have killed the fucking
[2778.79s -> 2784.39s]  guy though the wukong I just backed up too far and then I cleansed the stun for
[2784.39s -> 2798.96s]  no like really late hi there it was a man so boys good evening good evening
[2798.96s -> 2815.79s]  good morning I don't know where the fuck you guys live so good day fuck am I
[2815.79s -> 2840.50s]  watching wait that wukong lived whoa bro oh and I'm dead dude that wall was
[2840.50s -> 2842.50s]  BS
[2843.22s -> 2847.30s]  There was like a little hole and then I flashed late because I was like oh I could walk out the hole
[2847.82s -> 2849.82s]  But I couldn't walk out the tiny little hole
[2851.90s -> 2853.90s]  mother fuckers I
[2854.46s -> 2862.65s]  Shouldn't have even been there, but like I'm stupid. I should have just pushed bot
[2862.65s -> 2866.45s]  I was like dude. That's such a bad fight, but I walked over to those like I'm really fed
[2867.57s -> 2870.89s]  Honestly, I probably could have killed him if I didn't if I like flashed the
[2870.89s -> 2872.89s]  the
[2875.44s -> 2877.44s]  Annie stuns the only
[2878.00s -> 2883.74s]  Like most over like I swear if they reduced Annie stun by like point five seconds. She would never get played
[2885.04s -> 2886.56s]  like actually
[2886.56s -> 2890.04s]  The only reason to play Annie is her stun is just so OP
[2890.72s -> 2896.86s]  Because it's like a it's like the reason they changed Tarek so long ago where like when you have a point click CC
[2900.30s -> 2902.40s]  It's typically really broken
[2911.14s -> 2913.14s]  Okay, I'm just dead
[2913.66s -> 2942.90s]  Does Terak not have ult leveled up at six? He didn't level his ulti. Maybe it's maybe Terak ult sucks
[2943.62s -> 2946.93s]  Maybe it's underpowered, you know
[2948.69s -> 2962.56s]  Now yeah, he must have misclicked honestly, I'm just briefing. I'm like playing to aggro for like
[2963.58s -> 2966.18s]  Like I threw my lead because I was like, oh shit
[2966.18s -> 2971.08s]  I'm gonna walk over and help the homies. You never walk over and help the homies when the homies are getting shit on because
[2971.08s -> 2977.08s]  If you have like 900 gold or 1000 gold lead like I did or whatever you don't want to do that's because
[2977.76s -> 2979.10s]  You'll give
[2979.10s -> 2983.44s]  Mf a ton of kills
[2983.44s -> 2985.44s]  We're in a good spot now though
[2985.54s -> 2996.08s]  But I am still a little
[2996.24s -> 2998.24s]  Wait, Tarek, oh I've got this old winners
[3000.51s -> 3002.95s]  This Tarek does not know how to play Tarek by the way
[3003.63s -> 3007.13s]  He's throwing out his stun so awkwardly
[3007.81s -> 3013.89s]  That's okay though. I mean I apparently don't know how to play driving so
[3018.25s -> 3026.05s]  Can't really blame the guy. I mean you guys are doing
[3026.33s -> 3045.67s]  dragon with no smite. But it seems like doing dragon with no smite. I mean we could fight
[3045.67s -> 3056.93s]  these fights but it's like painful. We could easily fight these fights. I think a lot of
[3056.93s -> 3062.21s]  it is just like Tarek isn't confident enough to walk up and stun, right? Like that's that's
[3062.21s -> 3066.09s]  what I'm seeing the issue is. He's doing the thing where like he's not he doesn't
[3066.09s -> 3072.87s]  have the confidence to actually walk up since he's a melee champ. So he's walking
[3072.87s -> 3078.67s]  up and like taking half his health and it's making him nervous. It happens a lot with
[3078.67s -> 3085.95s]  players who are very melee champ centric because melee supports are actually pretty risky or
[3085.95s -> 3100.12s]  they're pretty scary rather. Oh he's totally dead. I don't know if I'm gonna...
[3100.12s -> 3106.00s]  But yeah melee supports are scary to play because you have to know when you can get
[3106.00s -> 3111.12s]  a kill by going in because you're gonna take damage right? That's just like the
[3111.12s -> 3121.99s]  nature of melee supports. Nice. We're coming back in a bit, not bad. We threw a little
[3121.99s -> 3129.04s]  bit early, but yeah, we're starting to get it back. We're chillin'. Tarik's a never-go-good.
[3129.04s -> 3133.96s]  I'm always confused by Tarik because he feels like such a good champion. The champion
[3133.96s -> 3143.00s]  itself feels broken as shit. Whenever I see Tarik, I think to myself, he's either
[3143.00s -> 3147.92s]  Unkillably like super OP or they're like
[3149.60s -> 3151.24s]  0 and 10
[3151.24s -> 3155.32s]  There's no in between right like they either know how to play taric or they know is what it feels like oh
[3169.42s -> 3172.62s]  You I mean you yeah, you are wrong taric actually requires mechanics
[3174.22s -> 3176.22s]  That's actually true
[3176.50s -> 3182.02s]  Where's like most supports like not always doesn't have mechanics, you know and like what's crank doesn't have mechanics
[3182.02s -> 3185.78s]  They just hit their button and if it if it works that they they get a kill
[3186.66s -> 3191.48s]  Where it's like Tarek after you stun there is like stuff you have to do that does make
[3191.48s -> 3210.38s]  sense or block.
[3210.38s -> 3219.23s]  Do you think um oh I'm gonna die oh thank god.
[3219.23s -> 3221.31s]  Do you think Tarek's one of the harder supports?
[3221.31s -> 3227.59s]  I think he's I think he's pretty hard but I don't think he's I mean he's harder than
[3227.59s -> 3231.27s]  the other supports like I think like I don't think there's a single support that's
[3231.27s -> 3257.44s]  hard. I know I'm toxic for that but I stand by it. I mean I'm just gonna die. I'm not
[3257.44s -> 3263.14s]  gonna try and flash. I don't think I should have just flashed over but I kind of got baited
[3263.14s -> 3268.58s]  by the Terakult I wanted to see if I could fight but there's too much CC. I was like
[3268.58s -> 3274.68s]  oh he's ulting me let's go. I can tell this is a really low elo game because there's
[3274.68s -> 3280.76s]  so much random deaths like I'm following victim to like I'm autopiloting and like I'm not thinking
[3280.76s -> 3285.32s]  and I'm just talking to you guys and I'm just dying for free but it's like there's so many
[3285.32s -> 3290.60s]  people just dying for free it's hilarious Thresh Thresh isn't actually that far so
[3292.68s -> 3296.76s]  like a lot of people think like Thresh mechanically is very difficult because he has harder than
[3296.76s -> 3302.44s]  the other supports but he's not actually that hard he's like once you learn the Thresh
[3302.44s -> 3318.70s]  combos he's pretty much a very upfront champion yeah like like Lantern for
[3318.70s -> 3322.18s]  example is one of the most broken things to ever be put in league and
[3322.18s -> 3326.54s]  everybody fucks it up like people will will just mess up Lantern because they'll
[3326.54s -> 3330.36s]  throw it for souls or they'll mess up like you can literally just hold Lantern
[3330.36s -> 3336.70s]  perma and your AD carry can walk up auto the turret and and and you
[3336.70s -> 3346.20s]  Literally like they literally can't play the game after that like the enemy team
[3346.20s -> 3348.56s]  I mean because like there's nothing they can do to stop it
[3349.08s -> 3352.46s]  We can totally fight this by the way
[3353.34s -> 3356.94s]  So like I've done that before we're like my thresh when I know I have a good throw
[3356.94s -> 3358.94s]  Hold on. Let me let me win this team fight really quick
[3360.38s -> 3361.88s]  Give me a sec
[3361.88s -> 3387.60s]  Okay, cool. Sorry. I had to win that team power quick. Okay, so as I was saying
[3388.20s -> 3390.20s]  There's a lot more to thresh than
[3391.28s -> 3393.28s]  People think right
[3393.28s -> 3397.22s]  It's essentially people over complicate like what he needs to do
[3397.52s -> 3400.76s]  So it's like Thresh is a very basic tip like when you see Thresh in pro play
[3400.88s -> 3404.64s]  You you don't ever see like what you do, but it's very rare that you see like the sick
[3405.76s -> 3410.38s]  Permahooking like oh my god, like it's mainly like they pick him for like Lantern
[3411.44s -> 3412.68s]  sort of
[3412.68s -> 3416.52s]  Like when they when they pick Thresh and high elo, he's not picked to be the god tier like
[3416.92s -> 3422.40s]  Always landing permacicy hooks like flay god like he's picked to like shut down engage and
[3423.28s -> 3431.90s]  uh remove kill threat to your carries that's always picked for that's he's literally just an
[3431.90s -> 3439.05s]  ewot armor stacking i mean yeah the armor thing on thresh is nice but it's i wouldn't say it's like
[3439.05s -> 3450.96s]  op on his kit it just makes him like not die to 80 carries in two seconds what what has happened
[3453.64s -> 3457.88s]  but i instantly know i'm playing with a good thresh player when i can walk up to the turret
[3461.66s -> 3477.02s]  uh when i can walk up to the turret and the threat sorry i was trying to think and talk at
[3477.02s -> 3480.58s]  at the same time. When I can walk up to the turret, my Thresh player won't walk up and
[3480.58s -> 3485.12s]  auto the turret with me. That's like the sign of a good Thresh player. When we don't know
[3485.12s -> 3488.46s]  where the enemy is, and instead of walking up and trying to hit the turret to like help
[3488.46s -> 3492.68s]  you kill the turret, they'll stand in the back and literally just sit there and wait
[3492.68s -> 3500.44s]  and hold lantern until they just hold their lantern until like you can, until you get
[3500.44s -> 3507.21s]  ganked, essentially. And that's why, like I said, I just personally don't think
[3507.21s -> 3509.81s]  Thresh's mechanics are as hard as people think.
[3509.81s -> 3512.01s]  I do think he's very knowledge-based.
[3512.01s -> 3518.15s]  I think Thresh has high knowledge caps, where if you're playing, I don't know, Lulu, your
[3518.15s -> 3520.61s]  skill is basically like, do I W?
[3520.61s -> 3525.81s]  Your decision-making on Lulu is literally, do I W to speed, or do I W to CC?
[3525.81s -> 3528.09s]  That's your decision-making.
[3528.09s -> 3536.65s]  So it's obviously much higher than that, but it's, you son of a bitch.
[3536.65s -> 3539.35s]  But it's still not like that bad.
[3539.35s -> 3545.79s]  I think Thresh just intimidates people because he can do so much, and so I think people just
[3545.79s -> 3554.04s]  get intimidated, but because they think it looks overwhelming to learn the champ.
[3554.04s -> 3557.94s]  I feel like that actually intimidates a lot of people in terms of like people not wanting
[3557.94s -> 3562.02s]  to learn new champions and shits.
[3562.02s -> 3568.10s]  I feel like a lot of it is just, um, people are nervous about learning champions that
[3568.10s -> 3572.70s]  that look overwhelming, right?
[3572.70s -> 3574.08s]  Like, Eiffelios, for example,
[3574.08s -> 3575.06s]  I was talking about this yesterday,
[3575.06s -> 3577.82s]  Eiffelios is not a hard mechanical champion.
[3577.82s -> 3582.82s]  Like, he's difficult in terms of the knowledge required.
[3582.94s -> 3586.30s]  Like, he's knowledge-gated very hard, right?
[3586.30s -> 3588.82s]  So, like, you have to play him a decent amount
[3588.82s -> 3592.26s]  or, like, research him to understand what guns do what,
[3592.26s -> 3594.74s]  how to interact with the guns, stuff like that, right?
[3594.74s -> 3597.78s]  But the actual mechanics of using the guns,
[3597.78s -> 3599.26s]  it's actually not hard.
[3599.98s -> 3614.07s]  Guys, what are we doing?
[3614.07s -> 3618.91s]  I guess we're just winning the fight.
[3618.91s -> 3621.71s]  Pyke?
[3621.71s -> 3626.56s]  Like, I think Pyke's harder than Thresh.
[3626.56s -> 3627.56s]  Maybe that's a hot take,
[3627.56s -> 3631.82s]  but I think Pyke is harder than Thresh.
[3631.82s -> 3634.46s]  Because Pyke requires like really specific.
[3637.12s -> 3640.68s]  Pyke is a lot harder to play than he looks
[3641.80s -> 3643.40s]  when you see people play him.
[3644.84s -> 3647.64s]  Because there's like timers of when you can go in
[3647.64s -> 3649.24s]  off of certain things.
[3649.24s -> 3651.20s]  Like hitting his ulti consistently in teamfights
[3651.20s -> 3657.52s]  a little harder than people think and knowing how to position in the lane like Pike is capable
[3657.52s -> 3659.68s]  of a lot more than people think.
[3659.68s -> 3669.45s]  So I think the main reason I think Pike is a little harder is because he's melee.
[3669.45s -> 3674.11s]  Melee champions are always going to be mechanically more difficult than ranged.
[3674.11s -> 3682.14s]  If the melee champion is like, you have to engage to go in and do stuff because there's
[3682.14s -> 3691.78s]  always the counter play factor, support roll, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[3691.78s -> 3697.74s]  I'm not saying overall like overall range champions require a lot more mechanics than melee just because you're ranged
[3697.74s -> 3700.10s]  You can die in a global and you have to space and stuff
[3700.46s -> 3706.26s]  But I think that like in just the support you support support specific. I think may ways are a lot harder to play
[3706.54s -> 3708.90s]  That's why you see a lot of like support players
[3710.10s -> 3714.46s]  We give like the best support place in the world are really good at like the engage melee supports
[3714.46s -> 3717.62s]  Not the like enchanters and that's why you see like why we praise
[3718.18s -> 3721.48s]  the best support players
[3721.48s -> 3728.76s]  Because like when you see somebody go in like perfectly on Rakan or go in like find a way in without getting knocked up on like I
[3730.58s -> 3732.58s]  don't know
[3732.58s -> 3736.44s]  Something like when they find the angle on thrash and shit. It's really nice
[3747.60s -> 3752.00s]  Well, I think well sucks. I think that champ is so bad
[3753.20s -> 3759.76s]  Because she just like she doesn't do anything
[3761.34s -> 3764.98s]  Like rails rails initial thing was like she was supposed to go in
[3764.98s -> 3769.80s]  be really tanky and then be like a stun bot for like team fights she was a
[3769.80s -> 3774.88s]  team fight monster but the problem with rel is like she has one chance
[3774.88s -> 3778.56s]  essentially in lane phase like if anybody has fingers on their hands and
[3778.56s -> 3783.40s]  they can move left and right rel is really easy to dodge like it's actually
[3783.40s -> 3787.60s]  like it's incredibly easy to beat a rel in lane to not die to her like you
[3787.60s -> 3791.52s]  just have to move left and right right it's very simple so it's like it's
[3791.52s -> 3799.16s]  It's much more difficult to dodge other engaged champs, if that makes sense, like Nautilus.
[3799.16s -> 3802.44s]  You can still move left and right, but he can walk at you while it's happening.
[3802.44s -> 3808.32s]  Whereas if Raoul walks at you, I'm still just waiting for the animation, and then I can
[3808.32s -> 3810.80s]  simply move to the left.
[3810.80s -> 3817.36s]  Because her animation is so slow on using her ability that I can dash, I can flash.
[3817.36s -> 3819.24s]  There's so much counter play.
[3819.24s -> 3822.24s]  And it's like, unless she flashes on you, but even then you can tell she's
[3822.24s -> 3823.24s]  going to flash on you.
[3823.24s -> 3831.72s]  I also feel like mid game rel has this issue where she has her one trick ulti engage fight
[3831.72s -> 3837.81s]  in teamfights, but after she does that she does literally nothing, right?
[3837.81s -> 3841.44s]  She's like a one and done.
[3841.44s -> 3851.12s]  That's why she feels like she doesn't have other expression.
[3851.12s -> 3853.92s]  She's countered so hard by the meta too.
[3853.92s -> 3856.92s]  Milio counters rel engage.
[3856.92s -> 3858.92s]  Thresh counters rel engage.
[3858.92s -> 3877.24s]  Right like either either of those champions shits on relengage and you can't do anything like I don't know if you've ever tried to play rel
[3878.00s -> 3880.40s]  Gone in and been like fresh flayed
[3880.92s -> 3883.32s]  But it's the worst feeling
[3883.88s -> 3890.80s]  It's a bad feeling. It's like when people play Leona. It's the same reason Leona shit right now
[3891.44s -> 3892.48s]  like
[3892.48s -> 3894.76s]  They both have the same idea of why they're bad, right?
[3895.84s -> 3899.04s]  They like have they're both good at doing what they're supposed to do
[3899.04s -> 3903.20s]  like you know stun and create pressure and point click and shit but the problem
[3903.20s -> 3909.44s]  is is like you can easily counter pick them so incredibly hard that they just
[3909.44s -> 3916.45s]  become worthless the whole game. Have you ever gotten Senna's secondary mission? Oh all
[3916.45s -> 3920.89s]  the time. With Senna being like with Thresh being meta and Senna being like a
[3920.89s -> 3926.81s]  champion I'm playing a lot I get that all the time. You don't even notice it
[3926.81s -> 3930.57s]  though I'm gonna be real. When you kill the Thresh or whatever and you get
[3930.57s -> 3938.53s]  his souls you don't even fucking notice it cuz like it's like 40 armor and it's
[3938.53s -> 3943.05s]  like your level 17 or some shit at that point like at the point you're getting
[3943.05s -> 3947.65s]  it you're such a high level that like the 40 random armor like it's nice but I
[3947.65s -> 3958.74s]  never really notice it trying to get your teammates ahead isn't that good you
[3958.74s -> 3962.98s]  don't have actually been doing as support on my main account I've actually
[3962.98s -> 3978.17s]  been roaming non-stop and it's super OP because the key to roaming is all you
[3978.17s -> 3984.05s]  have to do to roam well is literally be there one or two times in the first five
[3984.05s -> 3989.41s]  minutes of the game to completely fuck over the enemy one time on an engage or
[3989.41s -> 3994.01s]  something and they get so far behind from it that you can literally just walk
[3994.01s -> 4001.48s]  back bot like I do on Senate like I'll push bot lane this is this is my
[4001.48s -> 4005.96s]  strategy in Senna, I'm gonna give it to you guys, okay? So I don't know if this works in
[4005.96s -> 4012.24s]  Loiro, but in like, masters, like high masters this works at least. This is all I do in Senna.
[4012.24s -> 4016.88s]  Every single player I play against on Senna, every single one except for like, pike players,
[4016.88s -> 4021.68s]  even Nautilus, Blitz, they all concede lane level one. Every single one of them, right?
[4021.68s -> 4026.88s]  They just let me push level one. And so I'll push the waves in level one, and I'll
[4026.88s -> 4033.40s]  either crash wave 2 or wave 3 depending on how far they're giving me like push power right?
[4033.40s -> 4043.36s]  So I will always crash wave 2 or wave 3 bot and I will immediately roam mid every time.
[4043.36s -> 4050.60s]  And even if I don't get a kill usually it fucks over the enemy mid laner so badly because
[4050.60s -> 4060.18s]  on that exact timer, there's usually a gank happening on men.
[4060.18s -> 4065.34s]  So a lot of the time people think that you're roaming to get a kill for the laner.
[4065.34s -> 4066.34s]  You're not.
[4066.34s -> 4073.65s]  You're roaming to counter pressure from the other players in the game.
[4073.65s -> 4076.89s]  How many times have you guys been like, oh, we can win this 2v2?
[4076.89s -> 4078.01s]  You see the enemy jungler?
[4078.01s -> 4080.25s]  Your jungler comes, you're like, oh, we're going to bait this.
[4080.25s -> 4081.73s]  And then all of a sudden the support shows up.
[4081.73s -> 4083.41s]  And you're like, god damn it.
[4083.41s -> 4085.81s]  and then you die and you're like, what the fuck?
[4085.81s -> 4088.77s]  That right there is how easy it is to play support.
[4088.77s -> 4093.69s]  Because all you have to do is show up once, twice.
[4093.69s -> 4102.24s]  And now that entire lane is fucked for the enemy team.
[4102.24s -> 4103.96s]  Roaming is so easy.
[4103.96s -> 4106.76s]  The only thing, people fuck up roaming really bad
[4106.76s -> 4109.52s]  when they roam on timers where their AD carry
[4109.52s -> 4111.32s]  can't safely farm.
[4111.32s -> 4113.66s]  So what ends up happening is on that timer, right?
[4113.66s -> 4116.28s]  Where like I told you wave two, three, right?
[4116.28s -> 4121.08s]  What happens is you push that wave in, you roam mid, let's say nothing happens, okay?
[4121.08s -> 4123.76s]  I can just walk back bot.
[4123.76s -> 4125.26s]  You lose nothing.
[4125.26s -> 4129.56s]  And usually at that point, you have like 300 gold, so there's no point in backing, right?
[4129.56s -> 4134.24s]  Now let's say like, I noticed that my jungler is like invading topside.
[4134.24s -> 4137.70s]  I just walk over to top and help him.
[4137.70s -> 4142.58s]  Because you have like three to four, you have like three to four waves before the
[4142.58s -> 4155.94s]  The enemy bot lane has to play it almost perfectly to be able to abuse your roam on certain timers.
[4155.94s -> 4158.90s]  They essentially have to play it perfect to abuse the roam.
[4158.90s -> 4165.30s]  What I mean by that is like, the best way to abuse support roaming is you either A, if
[4165.30s -> 4171.50s]  you have the ability to dive, you can pretty much A, immediately dive, like push the
[4171.50s -> 4174.62s]  next wave and then immediately dive if you like have that ability, say you're
[4174.62s -> 4178.34s]  to play and re-own a draven or something, but even then it's a little risky, because
[4178.34s -> 4183.46s]  then the AD carry can just walk back and they only lose one wave and you gave up a stack
[4183.46s -> 4185.26s]  chance so it's not that bad.
[4185.26s -> 4188.54s]  Two, you can stack the wave.
[4188.54s -> 4193.22s]  Now stacking the wave is the best way to counter it, because let's say I'm roaming
[4193.22s -> 4197.14s]  for an extended period, you stack a three wave and then all of a sudden you're crashing
[4197.14s -> 4201.10s]  it and then you're up a level because you've been gaining XP and the AD carry has to
[4201.10s -> 4202.46s]  back off.
[4202.46s -> 4207.66s]  But the way to counter that is you simply walk back on the timer of the stacked wave crashing
[4207.66s -> 4209.86s]  as an AD carry.
[4209.86s -> 4211.86s]  It's so incredibly easy to do.
[4211.86s -> 4215.42s]  It's actually brainlessly easy to do.
[4215.42s -> 4221.54s]  It's literally you can roam all you want bot lane as long as you are in bot lane for the
[4221.54s -> 4230.93s]  stacked wave crashes or you are in bot lane when your jungler is bot side of the map.
[4230.93s -> 4234.19s]  It's easy as fuck.
[4234.19s -> 4237.07s]  But support players drool on themselves.
[4237.07s -> 4243.53s]  So they like to essentially support players like to like AFK in the lane phase.
[4243.53s -> 4248.29s]  They like to literally sit there and just do nothing.
[4248.29s -> 4255.28s]  That's like the average support I see is they will stand and do nothing.
[4255.28s -> 4258.06s]  And I've said this before, but I'll say it again, being a good support is not being
[4258.06s -> 4259.94s]  a better player in the enemy team.
[4259.94s -> 4264.54s]  Being a good support is queuing up to play League of Legends.
[4264.54s -> 4265.66s]  That's all it takes.
[4265.66s -> 4270.70s]  All it takes to be a good support is queuing up with the intent to push buttons in the game.
[4270.70s -> 4271.70s]  And not just AFK.
[4271.70s -> 4501.22s]  Alright, I'm back.
[4501.22s -> 4502.22s]  What's up?
[4502.22s -> 4504.70s]  I don't remember what we were talking about.
[4504.70s -> 4505.70s]  Oh, supports.
[4505.70s -> 4511.61s]  Yeah, they're all stupid.
[4511.61s -> 4513.81s]  Don't AFK on support, you'll gain LP.
[4513.81s -> 4515.65s]  It's actually that easy.
[4515.65s -> 4529.85s]  Honestly, I don't think supports are stupid.
[4529.85s -> 4531.05s]  I think it's more of a...
[4531.05s -> 4533.81s]  How do I phrase this?
[4533.81s -> 4545.21s]  In my opinion, it's more of like, they don't have to learn.
[4545.37s -> 4548.99s]  Support players don't have to learn important things
[4548.99s -> 4551.29s]  because they can get away with not doing it.
[4551.29s -> 4562.85s]  So they develop bad habits, that's all it is.
[4562.85s -> 4564.81s]  Do you have a Spotify playlist?
[4564.81s -> 4570.82s]  Yeah, best role to climb.
[4572.06s -> 4573.90s]  I think every role is good to climb,
[4573.90s -> 4575.34s]  as long as you're good.
[4575.34s -> 4577.66s]  Classic Jara, oh, I don't see.
[4577.66s -> 4579.22s]  Whatever you linked, I don't know about links
[4579.22s -> 4580.62s]  in the chat, because I had to turn them off
[4580.62s -> 4581.66s]  a long time ago.
[4582.94s -> 4583.94s]  So I can't see it.
[4590.30s -> 4592.80s]  I would say that climbing is just about like whatever,
[4593.00s -> 4595.50s]  because every role you can climb on, right, like every single role.
[4595.90s -> 4599.60s]  So climbing a lot of the time is just about what you think
[4604.78s -> 4606.88s]  is most fun for you and you can get the best at.
[4607.68s -> 4610.18s]  I would say objectively,
[4611.08s -> 4614.78s]  the best roles to climb on are jungle and support for just like
[4615.98s -> 4616.88s]  higher elo.
[4617.28s -> 4619.88s]  Well, jungle and lower elo support and higher elo.
[4619.88s -> 4626.36s]  I wouldn't climb on support in gold because you're not going to have a good time trying
[4626.36s -> 4630.04s]  to help bad players play the game.
[4630.04s -> 4631.04s]  Bad.
[4631.04s -> 4632.04s]  That's mean.
[4632.04s -> 4636.88s]  People who don't, you can get a gold Ezreal 30 kills by being the better support, but you
[4636.88s -> 4637.88s]  won't always win.
[4637.88s -> 4642.96s]  Whereas if you really want to control solo queue and your teammates aren't good enough
[4642.96s -> 4649.24s]  to carry at that level by themselves, you get frustrated, just pick something that
[4649.24s -> 4662.60s]  has more agency in the game. You lost 18 of 24 as jungle. You want to try any role? I mean you
[4662.60s -> 4668.60s]  could play AD. If you think it's... AD carry is interesting. I wouldn't say it's like fun,
[4670.04s -> 4683.12s]  but it's not bad. You're in gold. I mean you could try it. My view on it is that people
[4683.12s -> 4686.96s]  are wondering if they want to play a role or not. My view is just try it, see if you like it,
[4686.96s -> 4689.52s]  because if you don't like the role you're not going to be able to put in enough games to
[4689.52s -> 4690.78s]  to get good at the role, right?
[4690.78s -> 4694.42s]  So like just give it a try, see if you enjoy it or not.
[4694.42s -> 4697.18s]  And if like it's not fun, then if it's not your playstyle,
[4697.18s -> 4698.34s]  it's not fun.
[4698.34s -> 4701.24s]  Cause 80s are a unique playstyle from all the other roles.
[4702.66s -> 4707.66s]  Like the reason people don't like playing AD Carry
[4707.66s -> 4710.50s]  and like watching AD Carry streamers and shit
[4710.50s -> 4716.22s]  is because AD Carry is like, it's boring.
[4716.22s -> 4719.85s]  AD Carry is like zero.
[4719.85s -> 4721.93s]  Like if there was a graph of shit going on
[4721.93s -> 4723.27s]  when you're playing AD Carry in the game.
[4723.27s -> 4724.61s]  It's like this.
[4724.61s -> 4725.93s]  That is like spikes to a hundred
[4725.93s -> 4728.37s]  and then it's back to like this, right?
[4728.37s -> 4734.14s]  It's like, AD Carry is a lot of,
[4734.14s -> 4736.98s]  every game is different, right?
[4736.98s -> 4739.98s]  Every game when you play AD is different
[4739.98s -> 4743.78s]  because you're always with a different player,
[4743.78s -> 4745.64s]  like a different support unless you do OQ.
[4745.64s -> 4747.96s]  So every AD Carry's game's different.
[4747.96s -> 4752.48s]  Coupled with, you spend a lot of the game just farming.
[4752.48s -> 4754.98s]  You don't get to interact with the enemy a lot.
[4754.98s -> 4756.96s]  So you just kind of farm a lot of the game
[4756.96s -> 4759.08s]  and even then you also like,
[4760.46s -> 4762.52s]  you basically are farming for like little dopamine hits
[4762.52s -> 4764.54s]  of like team fights and stuff that you get around the game.
[4764.54s -> 4768.70s]  So that's kind of fun.
[4768.70s -> 4770.16s]  But it's like I said, it's all you,
[4770.16s -> 4771.84s]  you can climb on any role.
[4771.84s -> 4774.44s]  I think 80 carry requires the most mechanical skill
[4774.44s -> 4778.46s]  to climb because the difference between,
[4778.46s -> 4779.94s]  climbing is like a jungler is about being
[4779.94s -> 4781.28s]  in the right spot at the right time, right?
[4781.28s -> 4783.48s]  Like you need to path this way, get objectives,
[4783.48s -> 4788.00s]  etc. Climbing as an AD carry is more about like this person fucked up their positioning.
[4788.00s -> 4789.40s]  I'm gonna kill them.
[4789.40s -> 4812.58s]  Type shit.
[4812.58s -> 4821.96s]  We're gonna start a Q. Also, I want to say something.
[4821.96s -> 4829.40s]  If you are playing, make sure, and this is just a really good standardized bit of advice.
[4829.40s -> 4832.92s]  Make sure you're always tracking what the enemy cooldowns are, what their spells are,
[4832.92s -> 4833.92s]  stuff like that.
[4833.92s -> 4837.20s]  Okay?
[4837.20s -> 4841.16s]  Because playing the game is not just about like farming and you know, like your
[4841.16s -> 4844.84s]  team goes into the auto and shits. Like right now, mid's Mia, right? I can see that Varus
[4844.84s -> 4848.92s]  is Mia, but it is a Varus, so like I'm not too worried about being like level 2'd by
[4848.92s -> 4855.44s]  Varus. Not that much, right? So I can kind of play backward because I know that it's
[4855.44s -> 4858.28s]  a high chance he's not going to run bottom level 2 as a Varus. Now if that was like
[4858.28s -> 4862.92s]  a fizz or some shit, I immediately back up. So we noticed that it's pretty obvious
[4862.92s -> 4867.00s]  Rakan probably got W level 2, we don't know what it is, but he has Q. So he
[4867.00s -> 4877.55s]  doesn't have shield which means because he doesn't have shield it's hard for the
[4877.55s -> 4881.63s]  Recon to get back out if he fucks up and engage so you need to think about these
[4881.63s -> 4886.71s]  type of things right now this is wave 4 I believe and because it's wave 4 we're
[4886.71s -> 4890.95s]  gonna get level 3 on wave 4 you always get level 3 on wave 4 if you have full
[4890.95s -> 4900.39s]  XP you get level 2 on wave 2 and you get level 3 on wave 4 and these timers
[4900.39s -> 4905.55s]  for when you get certain level ups, bot lane are very important.
[4905.55s -> 4912.18s]  Now I'm going to hover over here, you see how Fiddle is right here.
[4912.18s -> 4919.80s]  I'm actually going to just walk in here and see if I can like, yeah we see him, nice.
[4919.80s -> 4922.76s]  See this is exactly what I was talking about before.
[4922.76s -> 4925.20s]  Do you see what my support is doing?
[4925.20s -> 4928.20s]  I left the lane.
[4928.20s -> 4933.16s]  Guys, I walked to like, stand next to my jungler after we pushed the wave in.
[4933.60s -> 4939.10s]  My Lulu is hanging out by herself bot lane.
[4941.54s -> 4958.69s]  But she's just chilling.
[4958.69s -> 4960.79s]  You don't want to do that.
[4960.79s -> 4965.49s]  You don't ever want to be the guy who's like, by yourself bot lane as a support.
[4966.85s -> 4970.09s]  Because you don't like, supports don't need gold, right?
[4970.43s -> 4971.93s]  Not really.
[4971.93s -> 4973.05s]  And you don't need farm.
[4973.05s -> 4974.03s]  You don't need all that shit.
[4974.03s -> 4979.03s]  So if you're AD carry roams, and unless the wave is fucked and they're just being stupid and you have to fix the wave or something,
[4979.03s -> 4981.03s]  you don't want to be by yourself in the lane.
[4981.03s -> 4985.79s]  It just doesn't do anything.
[4985.79s -> 4986.79s]  How about an auto tower?
[4986.79s -> 4989.79s]  Oh, uh, I used, uh, Tilda.
[4989.79s -> 4994.79s]  So there's a way, there's actually a setting you can have in the game where when you hit a button,
[4994.79s -> 4999.79s]  it makes it so that I can't physically hit anything but a champion.
[4999.79s -> 5000.79s]  It's Target.
[5000.79s -> 5002.79s]  It's called Target Champions Only.
[5002.79s -> 5004.79s]  And it's basically like, here I'll do it for you right now, watch.
[5004.79s -> 5009.35s]  you right now watch. You see how like I can hit the tower? You see how it's the red sword?
[5011.35s -> 5014.79s]  So when I hit this button, I can no longer hit the tower or the minions,
[5016.15s -> 5023.11s]  but I can still hit the champions. So essentially, when you're fighting in a big minion wave or
[5023.11s -> 5028.71s]  you're fighting under turret, you don't want to missclick. You just hit target champions only
[5028.71s -> 5033.75s]  button and it makes it a thousand times easier because you can literally only hit the champion.
[5033.75s -> 5051.47s]  It's really nice, and you can make the button anything you want obviously I just I use tilde. It's the default I
[5057.48s -> 5061.50s]  Actually want to kill these guys, but I need the way for the way to push out just a pair
[5062.60s -> 5066.68s]  The jungler could be bought, but it is a fiddlestick, so it's like I don't really care about a fiddlesticks being bought
[5067.00s -> 5082.95s]  We can straight up just kill them. Okay. Well apparently we can't kill them
[5086.88s -> 5089.92s]  Because apparently my Lulu didn't want to walk up
[5090.88s -> 5094.32s]  That's so frustrating man. I did fuck up my
[5094.32s -> 5101.04s]  my auto there, but I am a little, I am kind of curious what happens. I'd have to go watch
[5101.04s -> 5105.54s]  the Vod. I fucked up my kill in the Zaya. I think I walked left instead, or down. My
[5105.54s -> 5110.22s]  movement was bad. Like essentially when they fought, right, I walked like this. I should
[5110.22s -> 5115.52s]  have walked like this because you want to cut off the Zaya from the gank. Now I do
[5115.52s -> 5120.22s]  think when Lulu just blindly ran away, I think she kind of grieved. You don't need
[5120.22s -> 5123.98s]  to insta run from ganks especially when like you could see what I have right I have Dirk and Sheen
[5125.58s -> 5129.90s]  something that a lot of people do as well is they will see that like the numbers are uneven
[5129.90s -> 5133.66s]  and they'll instantly run away they don't think about like how to win the fight or like what the
[5133.66s -> 5137.26s]  the win con is of the fight because that's what I was saying before we got ganked right I was
[5137.26s -> 5142.06s]  like fiddle can't gank us and he can't pre-6 fiddle does nothing in the gank I had cleanse
[5143.18s -> 5148.62s]  they don't actually beat us in 3v2 so the problem was is we weren't focusing the same target
[5148.62s -> 5151.20s]  I went for the Zaya and she backed really far up
[5151.66s -> 5156.34s]  Now if we had played forward a bit like say she played a little more forward with me
[5156.34s -> 5158.98s]  That would have gone a lot better or if I had played a little more back with her
[5159.18s -> 5166.40s]  It was basically like we don't have comms. So the you know, it got rough now fiddle is six now
[5166.76s -> 5168.76s]  So it's a little scary. I
[5169.52s -> 5173.48s]  Don't like playing versus fiddle sticks for like the reason of like 90% of the time
[5174.48s -> 5178.20s]  Players don't know how to ward around fiddle people put wards in weird spots
[5178.20s -> 5194.66s]  We should have won that fight though. I'm a little salty. Mainly myself. So this too, Lulu keeps speeding me up.
[5194.66s -> 5206.19s]  I'm gonna be honest with you, I don't like when Lulu's do that. It's like a pet peeve thing of mine when Lulu's use their speed.
[5206.19s -> 5214.51s]  I'm okay with it if I need to dodge something or I need to chase somebody, but I think it's just so much less value than using it to CC early game.
[5214.51s -> 5220.83s]  early game the CC of Lulu like using W is so broken to me because they just
[5220.83s -> 5225.61s]  physically can't move their character for like 1.5 seconds which is crazy I
[5225.61s -> 5239.96s]  think fiddles bot you can kind of tell you see how they're playing really
[5239.96s -> 5245.46s]  aggressive they don't beat us 2v2 so I'm thinking and they just cleared this
[5245.46s -> 5250.68s]  ward out I'm thinking fiddles is either on dragon or he's bush ganking bot
[5250.68s -> 5259.90s]  Somewhere so I don't really want to walk up you see how this guy is confidently hitting the turret
[5260.00s -> 5270.88s]  This is making me think fiddles trying to lane gank because they cannot beat us to be to like I think fiddles in here
[5271.30s -> 5275.12s]  So I'm actually just gonna play safe
[5276.36s -> 5278.36s]  Until we see him on the map I don't know
[5279.42s -> 5290.53s]  I'm not gonna take the chance because
[5291.93s -> 5294.69s]  You got to think about like what you see and what you don't see on the map
[5294.69s -> 5298.85s]  Like we can't physically see fiddle, right? But think about this. We don't see him top
[5299.25s -> 5304.41s]  That's something you have to think about we we had a ward on rift just now for 15 15 seconds, right?
[5305.33s -> 5307.33s]  We didn't see him top
[5307.61s -> 5314.38s]  So like if he's not top, where is he now? I think he finally left
[5315.14s -> 5331.40s]  This looks like he went to dragon. Yeah, what are we doing by the way? I
[5332.60s -> 5334.44s]  Mean I guess I'm just gonna die
[5334.44s -> 5337.94s]  Now would be the time to speed me
[5337.94s -> 5342.76s]  I mean, I don't even know what to say about that Malzahar just didn't walk
[5346.46s -> 5348.46s]  Gragas didn't flash his E
[5348.96s -> 5350.96s]  Malzahar didn't walk
[5351.68s -> 5358.48s]  You always walk there by the way, I want to make this clear if you're a mid laner and you're playing a late game scaling mid
[5359.08s -> 5363.90s]  You always walk to the fight no matter what though if it's at if it's going if it's doing that
[5365.44s -> 5367.44s]  Okay guys
[5367.44s -> 5375.22s]  We need to walk two fights and Lulu you need to follow up when I go in don't run
[5375.22s -> 5382.61s]  I'm just gonna type it because I'm actually fucking annoyed my little
[5382.61s -> 5386.87s]  frustrated I still think the game is 100% winnable but I'm playing Draven
[5386.87s -> 5391.47s]  we're playing like I'm playing fucking Ezreal or some shit and I can't walk
[5391.47s -> 5395.07s]  up because essentially we know Fiddle was bought for the last two three
[5395.07s -> 5406.93s]  minutes right he just sat down there what is my Lulu doing bro what are
[5406.93s -> 5420.41s]  you doing no we fight this go yeah this guy doesn't get to do this for free now
[5420.41s -> 5424.65s]  they have a gale force so I need to be a little care this guy has no ulti though
[5424.65s -> 5440.54s]  like this is what I'm losing my mind man I do just follow no what she was doing
[5440.54s -> 5446.34s]  what she was trying to protect her ward she saw the recon hitting the ward but
[5446.34s -> 5449.48s]  But the Ziya walked up to get a freed to just die.
[5449.48s -> 5458.82s]  The problem is, my Lulu was like, oh, I don't want to give up my ward, and she wasn't thinking.
[5458.82s -> 5462.30s]  Please just sit with me, okay?
[5462.30s -> 5465.42s]  Yep, sorry.
[5465.42s -> 5470.18s]  I need you to follow me, always.
[5470.18s -> 5484.01s]  Even if it looks scary, you gotta follow, okay?
[5484.01s -> 5489.97s]  So one thing is, there's actually not a lot of fighting that happens in lower elo.
[5489.97s -> 5493.57s]  So a lot of these players don't know how to fight early.
[5493.57s -> 5497.73s]  Because one thing that I think has gotten really bad about league lately, just in the
[5497.73s -> 5503.77s]  past few years, is people don't ever, limit test and league ever anymore, they always
[5503.77s -> 5505.89s]  just play like pussies.
[5505.89s -> 5510.01s]  Every single player in league plays like a fucking pussie nowadays, and it's literally
[5510.01s -> 5519.16s]  just like sad to see.
[5519.16s -> 5533.11s]  Right there. Why aren't we W'ing? Use W on the Ziya. Not too speed. Like, I'm losing my mind.
[5533.11s -> 5536.63s]  Because all you have to do there is W the Ziya, she gets CC'd, we kill her in the W.
[5538.15s -> 5545.27s]  I'm telling you, Lulu players are like hardwired for some reason to not play correctly.
[5561.92s -> 5564.56s]  I'm never gonna catch this guy, he's got Galeforce and Tier 2 boots.
[5570.59s -> 5574.31s]  Yeah, I mean I I have to go for it though because if I don't go for kills now the game's over
[5574.59s -> 5578.63s]  So it's either we go for it or we lose so I'm willing to like look stupid
[5581.98s -> 5585.90s]  Honestly, this game was my fault for the one 2v3 that happened early
[5585.90s -> 5589.34s]  I misplayed it and if I didn't misplay that we would have won the game off it
[5590.22s -> 5592.22s]  Now the game's pretty much over
[5593.02s -> 5600.14s]  Like it's all okay, so we can always come back, but the problem is I don't think we have good enough players to come back
[5600.14s -> 5603.54s]  Like, look at what Lulu is doing, Lulu.
[5603.54s -> 5606.46s]  Why are you bought solo at the moment?
[5606.46s -> 5609.41s]  Think.
[5609.41s -> 5610.41s]  Like what?
[5610.41s -> 5611.41s]  Ahhhhh!
[5611.41s -> 5622.20s]  What are we doing?
[5622.20s -> 5624.36s]  This is exactly what I was telling you guys.
[5624.36s -> 5625.36s]  Doesn't make sense.
[5625.36s -> 5630.20s]  Remember when I told you support's easy, all you have to do is be a human?
[5630.20s -> 5636.38s]  Remember when I said that 40 sec or 4 minutes ago before the game started?
[5636.38s -> 5639.70s]  All you have to do to play support is think, push buttons and be active in
[5639.70s -> 5640.70s]  the game.
[5640.70s -> 5649.49s]  you can do those things you'll get challenger on support. Like it blows my mind. Like look
[5649.49s -> 5673.59s]  at what she's doing. What are you doing? This is a forfeit though. I'm gonna lose my
[5673.59s -> 5693.48s]  mind. Autofilled AD. I'm gonna lose it. My bad guess. I'm an autofilled AD. I'm just
[5693.48s -> 5710.69s]  bad. It's on me. I apologize. Oh man these players are crazy. I'm actually really
[5710.69s -> 5717.50s]  surprised we're just not forfeiting now. The best way to play the game is something
[5717.50s -> 5721.54s]  that like I fall victim to to where I fuck this up sometimes right but the best way to
[5721.54s -> 5729.90s]  play the game a lot of the time is you essentially don't play to take risks I know it sounds silly
[5729.90s -> 5739.88s]  because you got to find essentially you have to find the my mouse a hard just let let this
[5739.88s -> 5756.10s]  guy this 1000 gold walk away. Hey mouse if you moved by the way you get one K gold
[5756.10s -> 5759.38s]  Mid isn't hard roll.
[5759.38s -> 5765.36s]  I can mid in my sleep.
[5765.36s -> 5766.20s]  It's not.
[5767.08s -> 5775.88s]  AD is easiest roll.
[5775.88s -> 5778.36s]  I'm AD carry streamer.
[5778.36s -> 5789.42s]  I play AD, but Lulu is small brain.
[5789.42s -> 5790.46s]  That was mean.
[5790.46s -> 5792.58s]  Lulu took some crossfire there
[5792.58s -> 5793.50s]  that she didn't need to take.
[5793.50s -> 5796.60s]  That was my bad.
[5796.60s -> 5815.64s]  That was toxic.
[5815.64s -> 5816.48s]  I'll be real.
[5816.48s -> 5819.20s]  I think today is gonna be a mute all kind of day.
[5819.20s -> 5822.72s]  Listening to low elo players talk about the game
[5822.72s -> 5835.72s]  And then they think that they're right about the game and like how it works and all this shit, it actually like hurts me like it shouldn't I should just laugh it off but sometimes when I see a low elo player talk about how they think the game should be played and I just know that they're wrong.
[5835.72s -> 5841.63s]  It actually like physically hurts me.
[5841.63s -> 5843.63s]  It does it physically hurts.
[5843.63s -> 5860.88s]  But I should follow my own rule where if you're playing with people that aren't as good like they don't see what you see.
[5860.88s -> 5865.76s]  Right, there's like something where it's better to play safe and scale even on Draven.
[5866.26s -> 5869.46s]  It's better to play safe and scale than to go for plays in lane.
[5872.96s -> 5874.46s]  Mainly because
[5876.40s -> 5881.06s]  if you go for plays in lane and let's say your support is not as good as you
[5881.34s -> 5884.30s]  or your support's not confident in their ability to 2v2, right?
[5884.60s -> 5885.88s]  Then you're just going to lose.
[5885.90s -> 5889.24s]  So you're like forcing that person to be in an uncomfortable situation.
[5889.24s -> 5896.34s]  So, it's hard for me as a player to just play safe when I see the enemy making mistake after
[5896.34s -> 5897.34s]  mistake.
[5897.34s -> 5903.46s]  It's like something that I have trouble personally working on, just a personal issue, where I'll
[5903.46s -> 5907.82s]  see an enemy make a mistake positional wise and I'm like, oh shit let's abuse this.
[5907.82s -> 5912.30s]  But a lot of the time the problem that happens is you have somebody who doesn't know that
[5912.30s -> 5915.62s]  that person made a mistake or doesn't see the same mistake as me and because there's
[5915.62s -> 5918.82s]  no comms I can't relate to them that we should fight, right?
[5918.82s -> 5922.78s]  So if I go in and they don't know that we should be fighting there, I end up dying and
[5922.78s -> 5927.78s]  it looks, it feels really bad.
[5927.78s -> 5931.42s]  Which is, I mean, my fault, it's like a personal thing.
[5931.42s -> 5935.46s]  Cause you can't control your supports, you can only control yourself.
[5935.46s -> 5938.66s]  It's just something that like I suck at doing sometimes.
[5938.66s -> 5942.35s]  Right?
[5942.35s -> 5964.30s]  So that's just on me.
[5964.30s -> 5966.70s]  We could actually kill Zyra now by the way.
[5966.70s -> 5968.70s]  She's like 60% HP.
[5968.70s -> 5994.37s]  Like we could kill her.
[5994.37s -> 5996.37s]  What is my Gragas doing?
[5996.37s -> 6005.16s]  Oh, he got her though, nice.
[6005.16s -> 6011.60s]  Bro, use W to CC people.
[6011.60s -> 6018.72s]  Not to speed people.
[6018.72s -> 6027.26s]  That was a good example too, oh well.
[6027.26s -> 6029.62s]  I just got to get better at doing that where I play safe though.
[6029.62s -> 6030.62s]  That's on me.
[6030.62s -> 6059.86s]  That's just a personal thing I got to get better at.
[6059.86s -> 6061.82s]  Oh man, I think we're warmed up though.
[6061.82s -> 6065.02s]  What AD carry do you guys want to see next game?
[6065.02s -> 6067.02s]  That was a brutal ass game.
[6067.02s -> 6069.62s]  I'm gonna be real that was a brutal ass game
[6071.06s -> 6074.42s]  What ad carry streamer do you guys want to see or ad carry stream? What ad carry?
[6076.58s -> 6086.32s]  Champion do you guys want to see this game? I just goofed up and tried to play too aggressive with a player that wasn't willing to play aggressive
[6086.32s -> 6088.32s]  That was on me
[6088.68s -> 6111.57s]  That's my bed. I'll all uh, I'll play better this guy this guy goes scion. Oh
[6111.57s -> 6126.06s]  Oh, never change, Twitch chat never change.
[6126.06s -> 6145.67s]  Well, the thing is, I have to change my mindset, so like the thing, okay, let me explain something
[6145.67s -> 6147.59s]  just like a personal thing with me.
[6147.59s -> 6150.31s]  I'm very, very, very good mechanically at this game, right?
[6150.31s -> 6153.59s]  Like it's my best trade, it's like I have very good mechanics.
[6153.59s -> 6160.75s]  So and I also have like an autistic weird brain where I can see, I have really good
[6160.75s -> 6162.39s]  pattern recognition.
[6162.39s -> 6167.03s]  So when I see that the enemy is fucking up, I know that I'm pretty much always going to
[6167.03s -> 6170.83s]  be better at the 2v2.
[6170.83s -> 6177.87s]  So because I know that I'm always going to be better at the 2v2, I always want to take
[6177.87s -> 6183.95s]  the fight when I see that they make a mistake, like they miss a skill shot or they walk up
[6183.95s -> 6186.35s]  too far, stuff like that, right?
[6186.35s -> 6190.47s]  But the problem is, when you're bot lane, you have to work with a teammate.
[6190.47s -> 6194.03s]  That's part of just playing AD carry right and if you're in solo queue you can't always do it
[6194.15s -> 6197.79s]  So you have to I have to like train myself
[6198.91s -> 6203.95s]  To just be okay with them making mistakes and us not abusing those mistakes
[6204.87s -> 6207.75s]  It's very frustrating for me personally because I'm a perfectionist
[6208.07s -> 6212.39s]  So it's very frustrating for me to like see this happening and I'm like, oh, I want to abuse this because I know we can
[6212.51s -> 6214.51s]  but we have to like I have to like
[6214.83s -> 6219.31s]  Tell myself not to and just like not fuck up the way of state not take bad trades and shit
[6219.31s -> 6223.87s]  Because every time there's there's more to it too. So if like I walk up and I take a fight, right?
[6223.87s -> 6226.93s]  Let's say like when Rakan w'd in when the fiddle ganked for example, right?
[6228.19s -> 6234.23s]  If I take that fight, I'm now banking that fight on Lulu also playing correctly, right?
[6234.23s -> 6239.67s]  Like they they missed all their abilities and they fucked up, but I also messed like
[6241.47s -> 6246.99s]  You nobody can play perfectly every game like I can't teammates can't nobody can it's league and we're all humans, right?
[6246.99s -> 6252.99s]  so you have to bank when you're doing that on like your teammate being able to know what you want to accomplish in that moment in
[6253.55s -> 6258.91s]  solo queue with no comms, and it's really hard like it's a really bad mindset that I have sometimes
[6259.91s -> 6261.91s]  but it's hard to get over because like I
[6263.31s -> 6266.75s]  Like the landing phase for me is the most fun part of the game
[6266.75s -> 6274.49s]  I love landing face because in my opinion landing phase is like a little mini chess game between the enemy ball in right
[6275.53s -> 6278.09s]  It's like a it's like a chess game with like mechanics
[6278.69s -> 6282.49s]  Where it's like how how well can like I auto space them, right?
[6282.73s -> 6287.01s]  Can I can I space them well? Can I space them like can I by spacing?
[6287.01s -> 6290.29s]  I mean can I walk into them trade and not take damage back, right?
[6290.53s -> 6292.09s]  And I'm always thinking to myself, okay
[6292.09s -> 6297.63s]  Can I do that I can and then I'm like I want to do this right and then I'll like get somebody to half and then they'll
[6297.63s -> 6304.53s]  Panic and they'll engage on me and the problem is though is like I said without comms or without like people who are
[6304.85s -> 6306.85s]  Recognizing what you're trying to accomplish
[6306.85s -> 6313.15s]  Sometimes supports and junglers people get flustered and it will go badly
[6313.15s -> 6318.11s]  And it's my fault at the end of the day because I'm choosing to that play style of relying on my teammates
[6318.61s -> 6324.49s]  Instead of like knowing that I can probably outscale and play better late game and just like keep good CS and not die and shit
[6324.73s -> 6326.79s]  Which is what you guys should all do
[6327.49s -> 6333.51s]  And that's what I tell people to do when they ask me how to play ad I tell you like don't die scale up get items
[6333.51s -> 6338.05s]  But like because I've played the game for so long and my favorite part of the game is
[6339.93s -> 6342.89s]  Lane phase and like winning lane and playing that little chess game
[6342.89s -> 6344.89s]  I fucked myself over in a lot of games
[6345.61s -> 6351.77s]  Because I'll like, you know force fights that like my teammate would have to play well in as well to win and
[6352.45s -> 6357.93s]  I'll make a mistake or they'll make a mistake and we'll just lose the game off it and it's not a good play style
[6359.57s -> 6361.57s]  Right it's not a good play style
[6361.57s -> 6367.73s]  That's just like something that like I know other people probably also have and I'm telling
[6367.73s -> 6370.91s]  you that like if you want to climb you got to get out of that mindset and get into the
[6370.91s -> 6376.59s]  mindset of like consistency.
[6376.59s -> 6382.03s]  Because you can see last game for example I just straight up like lost the game off
[6382.03s -> 6388.35s]  of me trying to fight when my support didn't know how to fight or want to fight and we
[6388.35s -> 6389.55s]  lost the game off it.
[6389.55s -> 6396.93s]  Like I was too aggro and even though if they did play correctly we win they didn't so we lost
[6397.13s -> 6399.53s]  So it's basically like it's just not like a good
[6400.69s -> 6402.69s]  It's not a good
[6402.81s -> 6404.81s]  What's the word I'm looking for
[6405.01s -> 6406.01s]  strategy
[6406.01s -> 6414.06s]  Because last game was my fault
[6414.74s -> 6420.06s]  Because I'm good enough at the game that I know that I can't play like that if I want to be consistent
[6420.06s -> 6429.34s]  And I still point like it. So it's my bad. I what are we playing this game boys? We got Rengar
[6429.90s -> 6431.90s]  Karma Jin
[6432.06s -> 6435.26s]  What do people want to see? Let me see if any of the AD carries people want to see if I can play these.
[6437.18s -> 6441.90s]  I can't play Vayne into this. Vayne would be way too hard in the Carmagen. I would just get zoned off the wave.
[6450.88s -> 6460.48s]  I could play Aphelios. This is actually a good Aphelios game. You know what kind of sucks?
[6461.12s -> 6465.52s]  I feel kind of bad playing Aphelios when I'm on my teaching account,
[6466.24s -> 6470.08s]  like this account I teach you guys. I feel bad playing Aphelios sometimes
[6470.08s -> 6477.48s]  Because I know a lot of people don't want to learn a Felios or play a Felios because
[6477.48s -> 6486.60s]  he is like really, he's very unique, but he's hard to learn for a lot of people.
[6486.60s -> 6491.48s]  So I feel, I always feel kind of bad doing it, right?
[6491.48s -> 6497.60s]  But I'll be real, I don't know in this specific situation outside of like Jinx, I didn't
[6497.60s -> 6503.24s]  really know what else to pick. Jynx is good, Kaisa is probably okay, but you still get
[6503.24s -> 6519.29s]  zoned off the wave on Kaisa, because if we look at this, right, Kaisa would have been
[6519.29s -> 6524.77s]  I guess okay, but when you're picking a champion for bot lane, right? When you're picking a
[6524.77s -> 6529.45s]  champion for bot lane, one thing that you guys should think about when picking what
[6529.45s -> 6532.45s]  champion you want to play, unless you're one trick and then play whatever you want,
[6532.45s -> 6536.41s]  If you're like somebody who wants to actually like play the meta and learn why champions
[6536.41s -> 6541.14s]  are meta and when to pick what?
[6541.14s -> 6542.66s]  They picked Jhin Karma.
[6542.66s -> 6545.26s]  Now we have a Lulu.
[6545.26s -> 6550.74s]  If we had something with a hook, like a Nautilus, a Blitz, a Thresh, a Pike, like if we had
[6550.74s -> 6553.78s]  something like that I could pick a low range fighter, right?
[6553.78s -> 6558.30s]  Like I could pick a low range fighter if we had a hook champ.
[6558.30s -> 6561.90s]  But because we don't have a hook champ and we have an enchanter, I have to
[6561.90s -> 6567.90s]  pick something that can safely consistently farm and not get zoned off by their bot lane.
[6567.90s -> 6572.66s]  So there's not a lot of options that can do that.
[6572.66s -> 6575.74s]  You could pick Ezreal here, it's not the worst, but we had a Lulu so I didn't want to pick
[6575.74s -> 6578.22s]  Ezreal because Lulu goes to waste.
[6578.22s -> 6580.78s]  So it's like you could pick Jynx, but I kind of didn't want to pick Jynx this game
[6580.78s -> 6583.50s]  because Jynx boars the shit out of me right now.
[6583.50s -> 6587.62s]  So this would be a good Jynx game though if you guys are curious, like this would
[6587.62s -> 6589.46s]  be a completely fine Jynx game.
[6589.46s -> 6596.02s]  E stops Rengar jump you can follow up really easily with Lulu like this would
[6596.02s -> 6602.54s]  be a good jinx game but a Felios it's a good a Felios game too it's both it's
[6602.54s -> 6607.78s]  good a Felios game good jinx game it could be a good Zery game Zery wouldn't
[6607.78s -> 6613.02s]  be that bad here with Lulu and against their comp they're already squishy she's
[6613.02s -> 6617.30s]  really mobile can get away from like Rengar ganks pretty easily Tristana I
[6617.30s -> 6624.54s]  Okay, so Trist is unique because you only pick Tristana if you plan on winning lane.
[6624.54s -> 6626.04s]  Okay?
[6626.04s -> 6630.94s]  Tristana doesn't actually scale better than Jynx in any way.
[6630.94s -> 6634.98s]  Like, she does not have a better scaling than Jynx.
[6634.98s -> 6637.42s]  Trist vs Jynx, three items.
[6637.42s -> 6641.58s]  Jynx wins every time in teamfights, no matter what.
[6641.58s -> 6644.14s]  She just does what Trist does better.
[6644.14s -> 6650.64s]  Now, the reason you pick Trist is because you do want to win lane, you want to jump in, you want to kill them, you want to be aggressive, right?
[6650.64s -> 6653.64s]  So that's what you're picking Trist for, is that you get kills in lane.
[6653.64s -> 6656.64s]  The problem is, again, what we were just talking about, right?
[6656.64s -> 6658.64s]  Let's say I pick Trist to get kills in lane.
[6658.64s -> 6663.14s]  Now, let's say my support doesn't want to be aggressive.
[6663.14s -> 6667.14s]  And let's say the Jhin and the Karma have a really good push, okay?
[6667.14s -> 6671.64s]  Something that Trist is really weak at is being pushed in, right?
[6671.64s -> 6675.84s]  one of her weakest things because she struggles, especially early game, she struggles quite
[6675.84s -> 6678.32s]  a bit on farming under turret.
[6678.32s -> 6682.76s]  So let's say it's just like a coin-flippy pick.
[6682.76s -> 6688.44s]  You could pick Trist if you had like a support duo for sure, into Gen.
[6688.44s -> 6689.92s]  Trist is amazing into Gen.
[6689.92s -> 6692.24s]  It's one of Gen's hardest actual counters.
[6692.24s -> 6695.40s]  But again, it's not about countering the champion, it's about countering the lane
[6695.40s -> 6699.84s]  and what the lane is going to do to you and being able to play around that.
[6699.84s -> 6701.84s]  And this lane is a shove lane.
[6701.84s -> 6703.18s]  Jhin Karma doesn't fight you.
[6703.18s -> 6705.12s]  They poke you and shove waves in.
[6705.12s -> 6706.12s]  That's what they do.
[6706.12s -> 6707.12s]  They're a prior lane.
[6707.12s -> 6709.28s]  So they're just going to shove and shove and shove, right?
[6709.28s -> 6712.12s]  So because they're just going to shove and shove and shove, I need to play something
[6712.12s -> 6715.44s]  that isn't going to have issues playing under turret, or something that can shove back
[6715.44s -> 6717.72s]  if I need to, right?
[6717.72s -> 6724.42s]  Which is why Jinx and Aphelios are both good.
[6724.42s -> 6726.10s]  Israel again would just get shoved in.
[6726.10s -> 6727.10s]  Stuff like that, right?
[6727.10s -> 6729.70s]  These are things you actually have to think about when you're playing the game for
[6729.70s -> 6736.74s]  certain champions in certain matchups because a lot of the time people will pick a champion
[6736.74s -> 6740.42s]  that's meta and they won't understand why they're still losing the matchup even though
[6740.42s -> 6744.90s]  they're good at that champion and it's just that you're not bad at the champ the matchup
[6744.90s -> 6746.42s]  is just unplayable.
[6746.42s -> 6751.78s]  You could put faker, doublelift, fucking goomyasi in certain matchups and they will just
[6751.78s -> 6755.70s]  lose they will lose the matchups and it's because no matter how good your mechanics
[6755.70s -> 6761.64s]  are if the matchup is played correctly it doesn't it's not winnable and that's
[6761.64s -> 6764.96s]  why you see in pro play drafting is so important it's perfect example of why in
[6764.96s -> 6768.16s]  pro play drafting is 10 times more important than solo queue and it's
[6768.16s -> 6773.17s]  because when everybody plays the matchups correctly and shit right when
[6773.17s -> 6777.57s]  everybody's playing the matchups correctly and shits the matchup like skill
[6777.57s -> 6782.05s]  becomes a thousand times more important or like you know how the
[6782.05s -> 6786.61s]  matchups being play like the champions become way more important whoa what the
[6786.61s -> 6795.75s]  fuck I'm on there just fuck up what the hell is going on another little tip for
[6795.75s -> 6801.99s]  you guys who I fucked up but another little tip for you guys is melee
[6801.99s -> 6814.99s]  champions or melee minions take one turret shot two autos or sorry two
[6814.99s -> 6820.15s]  turrets one auto and casters take one auto one turret shot when you're under
[6820.15s -> 6825.27s]  turrets like walk okay so learning this will be actually a pretty game to
[6825.27s -> 6828.23s]  explain to you how to farm under the turret actually I was thinking about
[6828.23s -> 6830.87s]  Like what I could teach you guys because we're just getting a shoved in a lot this game
[6832.47s -> 6840.14s]  It's actually not that bad though
[6840.14s -> 6842.70s]  So right now we could actually space forward here
[6843.90s -> 6859.35s]  Okay, that did not hit me that was BS, but sure I did the same thing. I did last game man. I
[6860.71s -> 6862.87s]  Did the same thing you said I walked up
[6863.91s -> 6867.07s]  It wasn't it was a good fight, but again I
[6867.63s -> 6872.19s]  Keep doing that or like I see the fight and I'll take the fight because I know it's a good fight
[6873.27s -> 6876.07s]  But Lulu was too far back so I ended up just inting.
[6878.40s -> 6879.30s]  It's really stupid.
[6881.73s -> 6883.23s]  Like that was such a dumb play by me.
[6897.78s -> 6899.98s]  Cause I had to blow both my sums right there because uh...
[6901.28s -> 6908.28s]  The Jin, or I mean the Jin was in a really bad spot and the Karma was in a really bad spot because I was level 3 and they were level 2 and they were walking up to contest waves.
[6908.98s -> 6916.78s]  But my Lulu was behind me and when you're playing, you know, solo queue, you have to play as a team with your teammate.
[6917.68s -> 6919.58s]  Okay so this Jin is kinda griefing right now.
[6925.70s -> 6936.82s]  He's griefing by like walking up when I'm blue gunning him. I don't know what Lulu's doing. Oh, she's killing that guy. Nice
[6936.82s -> 6940.70s]  Yeah, they're they're griefing really hard. So the blue guns OP for what you just saw
[6941.26s -> 6945.68s]  All you have to do with the blue gun if you really want to just like have a funny ass overpowered fucking
[6947.02s -> 6950.66s]  When they're farming under the turret like that just hit the minions
[6957.87s -> 6959.87s]  Okay, we're getting ganked
[6960.31s -> 6961.75s]  Back up
[6961.75s -> 6970.58s]  So I kind of did a cardinal sin there. I would say like a sin of like
[6971.34s -> 6973.34s]  I overstayed a bit. I think
[6974.86s -> 6976.86s]  Oh, okay, we'll fuck off dude
[6978.62s -> 6982.34s]  That was greedy I should have back that the turret but I didn't think Karma was actually gonna do that
[6982.34s -> 6987.94s]  But I did overstay because you can see like this is the perfect example of why I overstayed so they stopped my back, right? I
[6988.94s -> 6991.46s]  Can give you guys a really good example of what just happens. I
[6992.62s -> 6993.94s]  overstayed and
[6993.94s -> 6998.22s]  When I overstayed I didn't actually get anything out of it like I got what you saw
[6998.22s -> 7002.38s]  I just have extra gold for nothing. So now I just have extra gold, right? And because
[7002.38s -> 7006.62s]  I have extra gold, the Jin actually gets a net positive because they stopped my back.
[7006.62s -> 7011.34s]  So he gets a free plate here, I miss a cannon, and even though I'm still up 10 CS, it's
[7011.34s -> 7017.78s]  like I could have been up 10 CS, not given a plate and not missed a cannon. So it's
[7017.78s -> 7024.94s]  basically like, it's interesting. Should you get Pryo for your jungler every game?
[7024.94s -> 7029.96s]  No, no, that's not important.
[7029.96s -> 7031.72s]  Some games, Pryo is important.
[7031.72s -> 7034.12s]  It's very important some games.
[7034.12s -> 7038.08s]  But you don't need to always be thinking about getting Pryo for your jungler.
[7038.08s -> 7040.80s]  That's not something you should be thinking about always, right?
[7040.80s -> 7043.64s]  You think about it in terms of timers.
[7043.64s -> 7049.44s]  That's important, but Pryo for jungler always is not something you should be worrying
[7049.44s -> 7054.50s]  about.
[7054.50s -> 7057.98s]  Because if you're perma shoving and you're like, oh, I have Pryo for my jungler but
[7057.98s -> 7060.66s]  then your jungler doesn't do anything.
[7060.66s -> 7065.99s]  that prior would if you don't have prior it doesn't do anything like I'd rather
[7065.99s -> 7102.94s]  hold the wave in like a certain spot oh my god I suck I mean it worked out I
[7102.94s -> 7111.54s]  think if I was six I triple kill them there but I think we actually almost I
[7111.54s -> 7115.42s]  think we actually triple kill them too if Lulu helps me but again you guys
[7115.42s -> 7161.20s]  know what I'm gonna say I go back to the thing I don't know if Rengar has
[7161.20s -> 7185.17s]  ulti or not. I want to shove this because chill. I want to shove it in for a second and I really
[7185.17s -> 7190.29s]  don't have anything to do so I'll just stand here. You want to also be backed once it's
[7190.29s -> 7195.01s]  hit for when you buy boots. I bought boots. Aphelios you can buy boots really early. He's
[7195.01s -> 7199.73s]  the champion where the more attacks you do is actually very valuable and positioning on
[7199.73s -> 7205.25s]  Aphelios is very important. It's kind of like some AD carries like you don't need boots
[7205.25s -> 7209.09s]  Really early like like with like jinx for example. I usually go free boots, right?
[7209.41s -> 7213.57s]  Or I go boots like after my Kraken but with a ferios
[7214.37s -> 7217.85s]  I really like the early mobility the early trading
[7218.45s -> 7224.45s]  Stuff like that's
[7224.45s -> 7227.97s]  Okay, so always be watching the map to we see the rengar's top, right?
[7228.45s -> 7231.01s]  We can actually just straight fight these guys to be to right now
[7233.01s -> 7242.67s]  What wait what what's my Lulu doing homie?
[7242.67s -> 7245.93s]  What, what are we, he's ulting us!
[7245.93s -> 7261.67s]  So you're saying, helping the AD carry is bad, got it.
[7261.67s -> 7275.10s]  I can't believe my Lulu just walked away from me, and just like watched, like, you work
[7275.10s -> 7277.50s]  as a team.
[7277.50s -> 7282.55s]  This is something that I cannot stress enough.
[7282.55s -> 7287.27s]  Play as a team, when you play League of Legends.
[7287.27s -> 7291.03s]  This tilts me more than anything because this happens even in Grandmaster.
[7291.03s -> 7295.87s]  I see teammates who will be selfish and not help each other.
[7295.87s -> 7298.39s]  Just help each other.
[7298.39s -> 7299.39s]  Help each other.
[7299.39s -> 7300.39s]  Please man.
[7300.39s -> 7304.19s]  We are a team.
[7304.19s -> 7307.03s]  Don't just run and leave your ADC.
[7307.03s -> 7313.81s]  Like I'm not even flaming you but like dude you can't do that.
[7313.81s -> 7317.89s]  You can't be upset that like I can't dodge every spell.
[7317.89s -> 7318.89s]  Right?
[7318.89s -> 7319.89s]  Welcome to the league of dreams.
[7319.89s -> 7326.37s]  something that I noticed that happens a lot in League now is players will have this weirdly high expectation
[7326.37s -> 7329.57s]  for everyone to play absolutely perfect at all times and
[7330.69s -> 7337.05s]  And they want me to like be goomy Aussie and I'm like dude. I dodged two of the gin bullets
[7337.05s -> 7339.05s]  I dodged a karma queue
[7339.49s -> 7344.25s]  Like you literally like I can't dodge literally everything will slow right like that's not how it works
[7352.66s -> 7355.40s]  Like dude, I'm gonna lose my mind with this guy
[7355.40s -> 7400.50s]  my Lulu is blaming me it's okay it's okay I don't need to be upset it's fine the
[7400.50s -> 7411.12s]  Lulu player is totally okay you know sometimes people think they're right
[7411.12s -> 7427.83s]  it's just what happens in the worlds right it's just it is what it is no
[7427.83s -> 7446.52s]  big deal. Sorry, I'm trying really hard to not be an asshole right now. This Lulu player
[7446.52s -> 7453.80s]  is making me want to fund Thanos. You know what I mean? Like this guy is making me like
[7453.80s -> 7460.68s]  this guy. We talk about like in League, we talk about like the players. We talk about
[7460.68s -> 7467.68s]  AD carry players having ego. I genuinely think support players have five times the
[7467.68s -> 7476.36s]  Ego 80 carry players have but with like a third of the skill. I think 80 carry players
[7476.36s -> 7484.88s]  do have massive egos but again I don't think that like I think support players are genuinely
[7484.88s -> 7489.68s]  the dumbest motherfucking humans on the planet and they think that they're the best players
[7489.68s -> 7519.40s]  to ever touch the game and it hurts my fucking balls. Hey Lulu would you be willing to
[7519.40s -> 7527.20s]  to have a VOD review with me in Discord after the game.
[7527.20s -> 7527.88s]  Let's just see.
[7527.88s -> 7532.28s]  I want to see if this person is willing to listen to reason.
[7532.28s -> 7557.23s]  Let's see.
[7557.23s -> 7561.23s]  I'm trying to not tilt, but it's really frustrating
[7561.23s -> 7565.55s]  because this player is playing specifically for KDA
[7565.55s -> 7568.75s]  and they're playing like they don't understand.
[7568.75s -> 7570.67s]  I can already tell you, if I go look at this person's
[7570.67s -> 7576.19s]  OP.GG they only play for KDA. I can tell you right now right here this person
[7576.19s -> 7581.83s]  plays only for KDA never takes any risks doesn't ever help their AD carry ever
[7581.83s -> 7585.91s]  when they get behind doesn't ever to walk up to like try and fight doesn't do
[7585.91s -> 7588.91s]  any of that. I can tell you right now without even looking at their OP.GG
[7588.91s -> 7593.67s]  from how this person plays that they have high KDAs but really low win rate
[7593.67s -> 7601.12s]  but I don't want my entire stream to be bitching about this Lulu so we'll
[7601.12s -> 7604.36s]  try and focus on how to win from this position because I'm sure you guys
[7604.36s -> 7607.88s]  get shitty supports too so we'll try and focus on how to win from the current position we're in
[7620.15s -> 7625.43s]  yeah it doesn't get better i mean i'll be honest with you my grandmaster supports on my main suck
[7625.43s -> 7631.11s]  like it doesn't get better they get better like mechanically at the game right like the higher
[7631.11s -> 7636.39s]  elo supports get better mechanically but they get worse they don't get better when like
[7637.59s -> 7640.71s]  it doesn't get better it's always like you'll either have a really good support or you'll have
[7640.71s -> 7677.84s]  somebody who sniffs glue I'm just dead or I'm not dead honestly our biggest
[7677.84s -> 7682.74s]  issue here is I need to get bloodthirster ASAP once I get BT the game
[7682.74s -> 7696.08s]  gets a lot easier we could kill this guy right now if the Lulu helps me we can
[7696.08s -> 7700.16s]  actually just straight kill these guys because I can ulti to heal myself right
[7700.16s -> 7705.44s]  we have Lulu ult I have ult to heal myself and I'm strong she has ignite I
[7705.44s -> 7713.68s]  I have everything, we could easily kill that Taliyah right there.
[7713.68s -> 7716.04s]  I mean yeah, whatever man.
[7716.04s -> 7721.64s]  This is what I'm talking about.
[7721.64s -> 7727.88s]  Again, are you willing to get into Discord and VOD review?
[7727.88s -> 7736.96s]  Yes or no?
[7736.96s -> 7741.28s]  I mean, I have to be honest with you.
[7741.28s -> 7745.32s]  The reason this is frustrating is because as an AD carry player, you want to be able
[7745.32s -> 7747.92s]  to rely on your support, right?
[7747.92s -> 7751.84s]  You want to be able to make plays, go in, fight and rely on your teammates because as
[7751.84s -> 7754.80s]  an AD carry player, you support an AD or like a duo, right?
[7754.80s -> 7756.28s]  Like you want to play it together.
[7756.28s -> 7760.60s]  No, no man, I'm not attacking you.
[7760.60s -> 7764.62s]  I'm saying let's discord after.
[7764.62s -> 7776.02s]  You can explain your POV and I'll explain mine.
[7776.02s -> 7778.86s]  Maybe we can like improve this player.
[7778.86s -> 7782.54s]  Like get them to be a better player and not ruin every game they play in.
[7782.54s -> 7785.98s]  Like that would be that would be the goat
[7790.72s -> 7805.84s]  Like the app that did not hit me by the way that hip-hop just BS, but I don't even understand. Oh
[7810.20s -> 7811.36s]  man
[7811.36s -> 7818.64s]  This is the person's
[7818.80s -> 7823.75s]  By the way, this is the person so be dodgy G
[7824.97s -> 7830.33s]  Average win rate 50% win rate like I said has really good KDA's on all his champs
[7831.73s -> 7833.19s]  But he doesn't win
[7833.19s -> 7836.63s]  I'm telling you right now
[7836.63s -> 7841.23s]  The biggest thing in league that the fakest thing in League of Legends is
[7842.15s -> 7844.61s]  Believing that you are a good player based on KDA
[7845.99s -> 7851.43s]  If I go look at any challenger level support player right now their KDAs will be like
[7852.23s -> 7854.23s]  four
[7854.23s -> 7857.87s]  They'll still have good KDA, but it'll be like four and three and it'll be on
[7859.31s -> 7860.99s]  That's your mutual
[7860.99s -> 7862.99s]  I'm gonna be real what you ran out to you
[7863.71s -> 7865.59s]  this Lulu player
[7865.59s -> 7868.19s]  Like I you could tell me that this person
[7868.83s -> 7872.83s]  Sniffed glue as a kid and their parents never told them to stop and I would believe you
[7873.63s -> 7876.11s]  I'm not even meaning like I would say that makes sense. I
[7877.35s -> 7880.39s]  Mean I said I don't even care. I don't care if it's a girl a guy
[7880.75s -> 7884.75s]  The e-girl thing is like that doesn't bother me, right? Like it could be a girl a guy a pigeon
[7884.75s -> 7887.43s]  They could they could fucking they could
[7888.03s -> 7892.91s]  Relate as a fucking peanut in a in a fucking plane. I don't care about that at all
[7892.91s -> 7898.07s]  You know what I mean like so that shit doesn't bother me at all
[7899.19s -> 7903.85s]  Like then be like I actually think it's stupid when people are like, oh, it's an e-girl ego like I
[7904.33s -> 7906.09s]  Think that's dumb as shit
[7906.09s -> 7908.17s]  Because that argument so crap
[7908.17s -> 7911.73s]  Because like I don't give a shit if it's a guy or girl because like you know what I mean
[7911.73s -> 7914.85s]  I'm more upset at the fact that this person is delusional than anything
[7915.85s -> 7917.69s]  That's like what's tilting me
[7917.69s -> 7930.28s]  Here I'm just gonna mute
[7930.56s -> 7932.62s]  We'll do one more game on this account after this game
[7932.92s -> 7935.72s]  And I'm gonna mute from the start of the game for you guys, okay?
[7936.16s -> 7946.98s]  dude if he didn't actually get me into the wall there I tried to walk forward so
[7946.98s -> 7950.86s]  that I wouldn't get condemned in the wall if he didn't stun me I kill him that's
[7950.86s -> 7971.87s]  annoying that was actually such a good hitbox for him my bad nice huge shut down
[7971.87s -> 7975.15s]  nice job if you're wondering why I'm even here by the way I'm actually I'm
[7975.15s -> 7978.63s]  not trolling I'm trying to get this turret because this gives me a lot of
[7978.63s -> 7982.51s]  gold at the moment I'm not actually worth that much gold there's nothing
[7982.51s -> 7985.31s]  going on in the map, there's no objective or anything like that, right?
[7985.31s -> 7990.67s]  So I'm trying to push in top waves right now so that I can get gold to try and like hyper
[7990.67s -> 7993.55s]  inflate my two item before this next dragon.
[7993.55s -> 7998.55s]  Because this next dragon is going to be incredibly important if we want any chance to win.
[7998.55s -> 8000.79s]  We have to win this next dragon.
[8000.79s -> 8005.95s]  And the only way for me to do that is to either get really lucky or go get some
[8005.95s -> 8008.11s]  gold in a side win.
[8008.11s -> 8009.95s]  It's just support difference every game.
[8009.95s -> 8011.11s]  It is!
[8011.11s -> 8016.35s]  I want to point this out, this person is playing this victim complex bullshit, like you know
[8016.35s -> 8017.35s]  what I mean?
[8017.35s -> 8018.87s]  But it is, it is actually support death.
[8018.87s -> 8058.95s]  Sorry, I'm tilted, I'm playing bad this game.
[8058.95s -> 8062.39s]  I need to mute these players because these players are actually tilting me.
[8062.39s -> 8066.47s]  Like I was fine with it before but I'm actually getting a little irritated that's made me
[8066.47s -> 8067.47s]  play bad.
[8067.47s -> 8070.35s]  So I need to mute them so I don't keep inting.
[8070.35s -> 8077.49s]  Like it's affecting my gameplay and it's pissing me off.
[8077.49s -> 8085.75s]  That's just my bad.
[8085.75s -> 8087.75s]  T split are you here T?
[8088.59s -> 8090.87s]  Yo T message this Lulu. I
[8091.51s -> 8094.87s]  Mean this in the nicest way. I don't even want to be toxic. I
[8095.75s -> 8097.75s]  Genuinely want to use this for content
[8100.81s -> 8102.81s]  Like this guy's been flaming me the whole game
[8103.13s -> 8109.33s]  Like I want to use this for content to show you guys that it is so easy to tell people how the game should be played
[8109.97s -> 8113.25s]  So easy if you if you can communicate by talking
[8116.75s -> 8120.43s]  Because this guy's been doing nothing but flaming me the entire game this Lulu, right?
[8120.87s -> 8125.27s]  but he's an absolute, like he played the lane completely bad.
[8125.27s -> 8128.55s]  Then he stopped trying to win,
[8128.55s -> 8130.43s]  stopped shielding me, stopped doing anything, right?
[8130.43s -> 8133.89s]  After he played the lane bad.
[8133.89s -> 8135.41s]  Then he started playing the victim thing
[8135.41s -> 8136.57s]  when I asked him to be a human
[8136.57s -> 8138.89s]  and like come over and like help me and play teamwork.
[8138.89s -> 8141.33s]  You gotta remember, I didn't blame him a single time,
[8141.33s -> 8142.17s]  right?
[8142.17s -> 8143.01s]  Like I didn't say a single negative thing
[8143.01s -> 8143.85s]  to this guy in game.
[8143.85s -> 8145.65s]  I said, let's work as a team.
[8145.65s -> 8146.49s]  He got upset.
[8150.87s -> 8152.71s]  Like I genuinely think it'd be great content
[8152.71s -> 8154.83s]  if I could talk to this guy on Discord.
[8154.83s -> 8173.94s]  and just like, oh I'd be so good.
[8173.94s -> 8179.56s]  Like dude, I'm trying to kill these people guys.
[8179.56s -> 8182.92s]  That wasn't bad though, we got 800 gold, not the worst,
[8182.92s -> 8185.40s]  but I don't know if my team can stall this.
[8185.40s -> 8187.16s]  Maybe if they can like kill this, they can stall it,
[8187.16s -> 8194.18s]  but no, yeah that's GG.
[8194.18s -> 8196.14s]  That was a disgusting Talia W.
[8234.34s -> 8236.90s]  I'm gonna add him and he'll probably not add me
[8236.90s -> 8241.21s]  but I might as well try.
[8241.21s -> 8252.25s]  This would be such a good learning experience.
[8252.25s -> 8256.61s]  Excuse me, dude, I've had like bad heartburn today. I need to take one of those heartburn pills
[8262.27s -> 8265.47s]  What Lulu what man just say I just let it out
[8266.11s -> 8269.59s]  Let it out
[8269.59s -> 8271.59s]  Let it out, baby. Yo
[8272.71s -> 8275.06s]  Lulu
[8275.06s -> 8280.41s]  Let's just just have a talk. Yo
[8281.15s -> 8283.15s]  Let's discord
[8283.31s -> 8285.31s]  We can bottom of you
[8285.83s -> 8303.77s]  Since I'm so bad. Yeah, trust you you just
[8304.81s -> 8315.26s]  Blamed everyone but yourself, but you didn't play correctly at all.
[8315.26s -> 8327.28s]  You played lane completely wrong, didn't help each other, left people to die on repeats,
[8327.28s -> 8339.07s]  then played victim.
[8339.07s -> 8366.32s]  I genuinely want to help you.
[8366.32s -> 8382.84s]  This guy screenshoted what I just said and put it in the end game chat.
[8382.84s -> 8385.32s]  What is happening right now?
[8385.32s -> 8388.48s]  What is going on?
[8388.48s -> 8400.16s]  There is no way that this is not an NPC.
[8400.16s -> 8402.48s]  There is no way.
[8402.48s -> 8404.76s]  This is not an NPC.
[8404.76s -> 8407.80s]  There's no way.
[8407.80s -> 8414.82s]  There's no way.
[8414.82s -> 8417.70s]  It's Geronimo Lamal.
[8417.70s -> 8418.70s]  It is me.
[8418.70s -> 8419.70s]  Yes.
[8419.70s -> 8422.46s]  Bro, just come talk in Discord.
[8422.46s -> 8430.35s]  I'm not even gonna flame you.
[8430.35s -> 8431.99s]  What does this even mean?
[8431.99s -> 8440.72s]  Bro, I don't think I've seen anybody more insecure in my life.
[8440.72s -> 8445.36s]  Bro, you are so insecure.
[8445.36s -> 8451.25s]  It's cringe how insecure you are.
[8451.25s -> 8469.50s]  oof good luck man on the climb to masters but jesus christ that's sad oh god I
[8469.50s -> 8473.98s]  dude I don't even know what to say like I'm gonna be real I was like I'm not even
[8473.98s -> 8478.54s]  gonna flame the guy right I just genuinely want to like improve the
[8478.54s -> 8483.94s]  community because that was three straight supports in a row they didn't
[8483.94s -> 8489.06s]  know how to play Lulu and I'm not even gonna flame the guy's skill. He's not a Lulu player,
[8489.06s -> 8494.78s]  right? He doesn't play Lulu. That's fine. But the issue was that I had with that guy specifically
[8494.78s -> 8500.12s]  was that it's okay to be bad at the game, right? There's nothing wrong with being
[8500.12s -> 8504.28s]  bad at League. Everybody has bad games. But when we're playing a game together and
[8504.28s -> 8507.70s]  you're saying it's winnable and you want to win the game, you can't pick and
[8507.70s -> 8514.06s]  choose who to like help win the game like if I'm sitting there bot lane we're
[8514.06s -> 8518.42s]  both being dove by Jin and you're intentionally trying not to take damage
[8518.42s -> 8524.78s]  and not die because you want to value your KDA over everything else so that I
[8524.78s -> 8529.50s]  you know what hold on let me think about this I think I figured this
[8529.50s -> 8534.50s]  person out this person lives in delusion and I think I figured this out
[8534.50s -> 8537.62s]  let me explain this a lot of players do this but I think I'm figuring this
[8537.62s -> 8540.34s]  out as I'm thinking about this.
[8540.34s -> 8544.90s]  So this person has really good KDAs on their profile, right?
[8544.90s -> 8546.62s]  This eye-catching person.
[8546.62s -> 8549.62s]  They have really, really good KDAs on their profile, right?
[8549.62s -> 8555.94s]  This person doesn't ever take risks, doesn't ever do anything to try and win the game outside
[8555.94s -> 8561.12s]  of just existing and hitting buttons.
[8561.12s -> 8566.60s]  And what they do is they will always have good KDAs and they will sit here and never
[8566.60s -> 8568.64s]  like I know why they're losing.
[8568.64s -> 8572.10s]  They will sit here and they will do this shit where they have good KDAs, they don't ever
[8572.10s -> 8574.32s]  die that much, blah blah blah.
[8574.32s -> 8579.60s]  But what they do is they lie to themselves and they say, look how good my KDAs are.
[8579.60s -> 8585.08s]  If I had better teammates, I'd always win.
[8585.08s -> 8589.16s]  Like, I cracked the code, actually.
[8589.16s -> 8590.90s]  That's totally what it is.
[8590.90s -> 8596.96s]  The players actually like play so safe and they play for statistics, right?
[8596.96s -> 8599.52s]  They play like purely for the stats.
[8599.52s -> 8602.44s]  And then they can say that it was their team's fault
[8602.44s -> 8606.62s]  that they didn't win because they played really bad,
[8606.62s -> 8612.58s]  but they didn't die.
[8612.58s -> 8613.94s]  Because I mean, in theory,
[8613.94s -> 8618.10s]  I could have a perfect KDA on every AD carry I play, right?
[8618.10s -> 8621.50s]  All I'd have to do is literally walk up, get one kill,
[8621.50s -> 8625.74s]  and then AFK and stand in the base the rest of the game.
[8625.74s -> 8626.58s]  And I could be like, yo,
[8626.58s -> 8627.66s]  why is my team not able to carry?
[8627.66s -> 8632.41s]  What's happening, right?
[8632.41s -> 8634.01s]  Well, you could literally do that.
[8634.01s -> 8636.85s]  No, I seriously think the person's self-gaslighting himself.
[8638.09s -> 8638.93s]  Like, I'm serious.
[8638.93s -> 8640.93s]  I think this person's like self-gaslighting
[8640.93s -> 8643.81s]  where they're like, oh, it's my team's fault every game.
[8643.81s -> 8645.17s]  Right, like they're always blaming their team
[8645.17s -> 8648.29s]  for their loses and their mistakes and shits.
[8648.29s -> 8651.77s]  And it's sad because like, there's a reason you're D2.
[8651.77s -> 8653.17s]  And I'm not saying that to be toxic.
[8653.17s -> 8655.93s]  I'm saying that like, you haven't improved in four years.
[8655.93s -> 8657.45s]  And you haven't improved because all you're doing
[8657.45s -> 8659.73s]  is playing to blame your team every single game
[8659.73s -> 8662.49s]  when I just saw like 500 mistakes that you made
[8662.49s -> 8671.66s]  that we could have won the game off of early game.
[8671.66s -> 8672.94s]  Here, I remember somebody wanted me
[8672.94s -> 8674.98s]  to play a Caitlyn game last game,
[8674.98s -> 8676.62s]  so we're gonna play Cait.
[8677.82s -> 8679.66s]  I don't remember who it was in the chat.
[8679.66s -> 8681.70s]  Somebody, like two people said Cait,
[8681.70s -> 8684.20s]  but we'll do a Cait game for you guys.
[8684.20s -> 8703.31s]  I got you boys, don't worry.
[8703.31s -> 8706.11s]  All right, I'm gonna take Ghost Flash
[8706.11s -> 8708.11s]  because they have three melee champs, four melee champs.
[8708.11s -> 8710.43s]  They have Recon Zed, Kled, Gragas,
[8710.43s -> 8712.13s]  so I'm gonna take Ghost Flash.
[8713.39s -> 8715.27s]  These are gonna be my runes this game.
[8715.27s -> 8718.27s]  I'm going to take a little more MR because I don't think we're going to be fighting too much in lane.
[8718.77s -> 8721.57s]  We're pretty much just going to be poking them with Karma Kate.
[8722.57s -> 8725.37s]  So I'm going to take a little bit of extra MR because I'm going to be playing for mid delay game.
[8725.37s -> 8726.07s]  I'm just scaling.
[8727.87s -> 8729.07s]  And these are going to be the runes that I take.
[8737.39s -> 8739.89s]  Giving class on AD carry or the easier to play ones.
[8740.59s -> 8745.29s]  In AD carry, I usually do like when I'm playing on this account right now, this is like my teaching account.
[8746.29s -> 8748.79s]  It's a little lower MMR, right? It's like D1 low masters.
[8748.79s -> 8757.07s]  I usually play 80 carries that like the chat wants to see me play so that you guys can learn like good and bad matchups and things like that
[8758.55s -> 8762.71s]  The last two games I got way too tilted by shitty support players
[8763.19s -> 8766.91s]  Like egos and all that shit. I got way too frustrated and I played bad the last two games
[8767.17s -> 8769.09s]  So we're gonna
[8769.09s -> 8771.73s]  Honestly, I'm just gonna I think I'm just gonna mute these people at the very start of the game
[8772.51s -> 8777.35s]  Normally, I wouldn't suggest you meet people because like playing as a team is really important
[8777.35s -> 8782.11s]  Because like you know you need to communicate and all that shit, but I am just like I'm gonna mute them
[8783.71s -> 8785.75s]  Cuz I
[8785.75s -> 8789.83s]  Dude my mental is taking a fucking hit right now, so we're gonna just chill and play I
[8793.57s -> 8798.57s]  Just don't know how to play Nila. I think Nila's really good. I just don't I don't know how to play her I
[8799.97s -> 8806.46s]  Think she's a great champ like I've been getting shit on by Nila on my main account
[8806.46s -> 8820.18s]  Like a lot of Grandmaster Nyla's have been dumpstering me.
[8820.18s -> 8824.02s]  I think she's just really good at abusing solo queue.
[8824.02s -> 8829.70s]  Like the issue with Nyla is from what I've seen, all the losses I've had with Nyla,
[8829.70s -> 8833.34s]  people don't, um, it's like the thing I was telling you about before.
[8833.34s -> 8838.22s]  People don't play aggressively in the lower elos, like even in Grandmaster, people don't
[8838.22s -> 8839.62s]  play like aggressively enough.
[8839.62s -> 8841.46s]  It sounds crazy to say that, but it's true.
[8841.46s -> 8844.38s]  They don't play aggressively enough in lane, so you can get away with just picking
[8844.38s -> 8849.70s]  Nyla and scaling and Nyla at like one item you'll always be up in levels right
[8849.70s -> 8854.10s]  because that's how the champion works the champion works in like you'll always be
[8854.10s -> 8859.90s]  up in levels because of her passive so you basically just like scale through
[8859.90s -> 8865.38s]  existing it's pretty it's pretty interesting all right so we're playing
[8865.38s -> 8875.03s]  cake karma oh I missed a minion because I suck I'm gonna ward this bush just
[8875.03s -> 8883.82s]  because I don't want the Rakan in the bush.
[8883.82s -> 8886.64s]  So now that the bush isn't warded anymore,
[8886.64s -> 8887.88s]  okay, warded nice.
[8887.88s -> 8892.38s]  I was gonna say, what I wanna do is I actually wanna play,
[8892.38s -> 8893.58s]  aw, I suck.
[8893.58s -> 8896.08s]  I actually wanted to play, oh man, I'm so bad at Cait.
[8896.08s -> 8898.14s]  I wanted to play on the top side of the wave
[8898.14s -> 8901.26s]  so that I'm not standing near the bushes, right?
[8901.26s -> 8904.18s]  Because if you stand near the bushes,
[8904.18s -> 8906.14s]  the Rakan can obviously like W me and I just get fucked.
[8906.14s -> 8908.52s]  So, I'd rather play in a safer spot.
[8909.82s -> 8912.74s]  Can't believe I missed 2 CS, I'm so fucking bad.
[8912.74s -> 8915.46s]  Now I want to push in wave 3 and I want to go buy a call.
[8915.46s -> 8925.66s]  So I'm going to ping to push.
[8925.66s -> 8927.38s]  OK.
[8927.38s -> 8930.46s]  So I actually want to back here, and I'm going to go buy a call.
[8930.46s -> 8933.62s]  So this is called a cheater recall.
[8933.62s -> 8938.46s]  You usually have perfect CS to back on this timer,
[8938.46s -> 8939.54s]  and you can go buy a call.
[8939.54s -> 8940.70s]  OK.
[8940.70s -> 8942.02s]  This is like something that you
[8942.02s -> 8943.46s]  can do if you're in a lane that's
[8943.46s -> 8944.82s]  going to be perma shoving.
[8944.82s -> 8945.94s]  So what happens is the reason it's
[8945.94s -> 8949.58s]  called a cheater recall is because we push the wave in.
[8949.58s -> 8952.66s]  They had to stay and farm the wave, right?
[8952.66s -> 8956.39s]  Now watch.
[8956.39s -> 8958.31s]  They have to push this wave in, right?
[8958.31s -> 8960.47s]  Now if Karma was here instead of roaming,
[8960.47s -> 8961.75s]  this roam's fine by the way,
[8961.75s -> 8962.91s]  but if she was here instead of roaming,
[8962.91s -> 8964.67s]  she could actually hold the wave.
[8965.67s -> 8967.11s]  And if you notice here,
[8967.11s -> 8969.87s]  I don't actually miss that many minions, right?
[8969.87s -> 8974.99s]  We're chillin'.
[8974.99s -> 8977.71s]  Now we can solo push this, we're safe.
[8977.71s -> 8980.19s]  I should actually fast push this,
[8980.19s -> 8981.27s]  because I wanted to bounce.
[8981.27s -> 8982.19s]  I don't wanna solo push this,
[8982.19s -> 8992.75s]  But I can't fast-push this at level 3 by myself.
[8992.75s -> 8994.95s]  So we're just going to chill.
[8994.95s -> 8999.39s]  Kaelin's really good at abusing early lane phase bullying,
[8999.39s -> 9001.35s]  just based on what our kit does.
[9001.35s -> 9002.87s]  We see Rakan on the map top side.
[9002.87s -> 9004.87s]  You see that?
[9004.87s -> 9009.89s]  So because we see Rakan, I can walk up a bit.
[9009.89s -> 9018.08s]  And we can play a little aggro here.
[9018.08s -> 9020.04s]  You can kind of see like, I don't have
[9020.04s -> 9021.24s]  to play behind the minion wave.
[9021.24s -> 9023.60s]  You see what I'm doing to this guy, right?
[9023.60s -> 9034.05s]  Hate this game. We can quit we can we can forfeit. It's fun. I hate this game. I really hate this game
[9034.77s -> 9037.77s]  Dude, what is wrong with me right now? It's like my brain doesn't work
[9038.21s -> 9049.30s]  It's the 280 K nerf telling you so we're cons gonna be bought right now. I
[9050.78s -> 9052.50s]  Know he's gonna be bought
[9052.50s -> 9054.50s]  So I need to be a little care
[9054.74s -> 9056.74s]  Now my karma is here
[9058.99s -> 9062.35s]  There we go. So you notice how I didn't use any spells. I'm not I'm just chilling
[9065.54s -> 9066.86s]  dude
[9066.86s -> 9068.86s]  Are you kidding me, man?
[9068.86s -> 9076.38s]  I'm gonna be honest. I'm getting really tilted by these players now like the Recon W's in
[9077.06s -> 9079.96s]  They just stand there and watch me die
[9081.42s -> 9085.54s]  Okay, it's fine. Listen, I'm not gonna get too mad about it. It's fine. I should have flashed the knockup
[9085.54s -> 9089.12s]  I guess even though in reality I should never have to flash the knockup
[9089.40s -> 9092.20s]  But I should have flashed it because I can't trust the teammates
[9092.44s -> 9096.64s]  So what I'm saying is right there karma and fiddle were both right here. I was being chased down
[9096.64s -> 9101.48s]  They stood here they didn't they didn't walk up to do anything. They just stood and waited
[9102.60s -> 9105.28s]  That pisses me off because I hate when players
[9106.36s -> 9108.36s]  play
[9108.36s -> 9115.41s]  Selfish and scared. It's my biggest pet peeve. It drives me fucking crazy, man
[9116.65s -> 9118.65s]  Sorry, I'm getting I'm losing my mind
[9119.29s -> 9129.70s]  Like it's so easy. It's fine though. I shouldn't have walked up and ego to it. It's on me
[9129.70s -> 9142.62s]  I want to so push this wave
[9142.62s -> 9157.93s]  Yeah, I'm losing it this by the way would be an example of a bad time for karma to run. She needs to come back bot
[9158.39s -> 9164.14s]  There's absolutely no reason for it to roam on that timer
[9165.02s -> 9169.78s]  There's also no reason for it to be in that bush over there. We should be playing up to try we're playing Kate karma, right?
[9170.18s -> 9172.74s]  We should be playing forward so that we can actually be aggressive
[9173.66s -> 9178.18s]  Kate karma's a lane bully lane. We don't want to sit here and just do nothing if you pick karma
[9178.18s -> 9182.94s]  You want to be aggressive you want to be playing up you want to be stunning you want to be doing like aggressive things playing the game
[9182.94s -> 9198.53s]  We're level six. I'd really like to like go in. Yeah, like that was actually not bad by the karma
[9198.53s -> 9202.05s]  She w'd the Zyah, and then I got to trap off of it. So that wasn't too bad
[9203.33s -> 9224.26s]  Not the worst not not bad. That was good. That was good
[9225.46s -> 9243.75s]  Really nice really nice. Okay, so I'm gonna back here cuz I don't want to overstay for the wave. I'm gonna grab boots
[9245.87s -> 9249.70s]  You don't I think a lot of it is too I
[9250.46s -> 9254.78s]  Think a lot of it is people get really scared when they like Rickon is really strong in this meta, right?
[9254.78s -> 9260.14s]  Like he's very very powerful. He is like numbers are a little too high right now. So like everything he does is just a little too
[9260.14s -> 9266.26s]  Good, so I think people get nervous around Rakan especially with Zaya because it's like when people would get nervous around non-illusion
[9266.26s -> 9269.22s]  The lane like plays itself. It's very strong. It's very hard to beat
[9269.62s -> 9272.26s]  But you can still see people making mistakes when they play the lane
[9272.26s -> 9283.73s]  So you got to watch for that type of stuff now a good way to play against a Zaya once you hit six is
[9287.77s -> 9289.77s]  You don't want to
[9291.05s -> 9293.41s]  You don't want to ever walk melee range of earth
[9293.93s -> 9296.33s]  or give her the ability to just kill you with the feathers.
[9296.95s -> 9298.45s]  Your main goal here is gonna be
[9299.15s -> 9301.15s]  try and stay in a good spot when it comes to
[9302.23s -> 9303.99s]  feathers, like I want to be to the side of her.
[9304.69s -> 9308.89s]  The side of her is the best option, like where she can't pull in, like I'll get hit by maybe a few,
[9309.15s -> 9310.35s]  but she can't pull in all of them.
[9312.69s -> 9314.05s]  That's a really
[9314.35s -> 9315.91s]  key thing when playing versus her.
[9316.35s -> 9320.45s]  Cause I remember back in the day I didn't know how to play Versaia and I would always get fucking frustrated as shit.
[9321.31s -> 9324.25s]  So, Rakan's 5. I want to hit Tab, see Rakan's 5.
[9325.03s -> 9333.97s]  We shouldn't be able to die here. I want to push this wave in but I also need to stay away from where the rakan could be
[9334.47s -> 9338.22s]  So if you want to push waves in and reset the wave
[9340.02s -> 9349.27s]  Make sure that you're standing as far away as you can from where they can engage on you now
[9349.27s -> 9353.71s]  They're about to be six rakan is so they have a really strong level six. She has pickaxe and noon quiver
[9354.13s -> 9356.77s]  We do want to be a little hesitant here. We don't want to fight
[9358.23s -> 9360.67s]  Now I'm gonna kind of push this in a bit
[9360.67s -> 9366.99s]  We should have been spam pushing the whole wave because that's how Kate karma plays. We just push push push push
[9367.83s -> 9371.35s]  But we played that that early roam by karma
[9372.55s -> 9374.55s]  Kind of put us behind on that
[9375.15s -> 9377.15s]  It's not a big deal. It's just something that
[9377.71s -> 9379.71s]  We have to adjust
[9380.03s -> 9385.64s]  Why does this say 88 and this say 90?
[9386.10s -> 9408.39s]  Which one is it? Is it 88 or 90? I mean that guy's dead
[9408.39s -> 9411.83s]  I don't know what that karma's thinking, but
[9414.62s -> 9422.46s]  We probably have to give this Drake. I mean, maybe we could fight it if fiddle had ulti, but
[9423.18s -> 9432.36s]  Him not having all the others no way the higher one counts ward kills
[9433.40s -> 9435.40s]  Why I
[9436.12s -> 9439.12s]  Think that's so stupid, so they might try and engage here
[9440.88s -> 9442.56s]  Unless they somehow know
[9442.56s -> 9446.08s]  Fiddles in the bush, which would be impressive because we know it's not warded
[9446.08s -> 9472.70s]  So that'd be pretty impressive if they knew that we could actually refs. I'm just gonna ghost
[9473.54s -> 9479.14s]  This is crazy. What the fuck?
[9479.92s -> 9481.52s]  This is interesting
[9481.52s -> 9490.18s]  They saw fit a hundred percent. Yeah, I don't know where though. It must that because he used this thing
[9491.56s -> 9493.56s]  But I'll use his whatever it's called
[9494.20s -> 9497.42s]  his effigy I
[9497.42s -> 9498.76s]  Have to go look
[9498.76s -> 9508.30s]  One million. Oh, I guess I didn't see it. I should back I can get dove here
[9508.30s -> 9514.42s]  We don't know where Gragas is like if Gragas happens to be like he ease over this wall or something. I think it don't really easy
[9514.42s -> 9516.42s]  I'm greeting really hard
[9517.10s -> 9519.10s]  Greeting usually gets you killed
[9519.10s -> 9520.70s]  typically I
[9520.70s -> 9524.02s]  Shouldn't be doing this
[9524.02s -> 9527.54s]  They're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right?
[9528.18s -> 9529.78s]  it's like
[9529.78s -> 9536.14s]  If you know something it's gonna be a bad habit you should not do it just cue the bush
[9536.14s -> 9540.20s]  Okay, that was I meant use like an actual Q
[9543.10s -> 9546.22s]  They could also be in the alcove so I'm a little hesitant, but it's fine
[9552.02s -> 9556.26s]  Okay, so the reason I stayed was because now I have my I have my mythic right?
[9556.94s -> 9561.08s]  Because we we finished the coal and we finished the mythic at the same time or finished the wave so
[9562.78s -> 9564.78s]  Now I have two options I go gale force here
[9565.26s -> 9570.42s]  To dodge a lot of their shits or I can do what sounds like a fun option
[9571.78s -> 9573.78s]  We're gonna do shield them
[9573.82s -> 9577.02s]  I'm gonna show you guys why I like shield bow on Caitlyn
[9577.90s -> 9579.90s]  It's not the best mythic
[9579.94s -> 9582.34s]  But it's good into certain comps
[9583.46s -> 9585.46s]  If you don't want to get
[9587.46s -> 9589.46s]  Yeah
[9589.58s -> 9591.88s]  Because I have a lacquer do this game. I don't have bloodline right?
[9592.50s -> 9601.65s]  So I kind of want to go shield bow and then I'm gonna end up going
[9602.53s -> 9604.53s]  Either IE or I'm gonna end up going
[9605.09s -> 9610.81s]  Like bloodthirster seconds I your BT
[9610.81s -> 9617.49s]  probably IE just because I think of it I think it's actually easier to go IE this
[9617.49s -> 9627.64s]  game but yeah this is a kind of boring game our teams doing really well though
[9627.64s -> 9656.72s]  so we just chill we got to be a little care okay it was kind of hard to do
[9656.72s -> 9660.84s]  anything there even though I got like a few autos on the Gragas it's a little
[9660.84s -> 9668.84s]  difficult to actually play the game there because if I walk up too far like
[9668.84s -> 9675.49s]  see we're cons there if I walk up too far I just get killed by Rakan all right
[9675.49s -> 9677.49s]  I'm just gonna reset and go get boots
[9679.78s -> 9682.10s]  Typically adc is really fucking boring
[9682.74s -> 9684.74s]  in games like this
[9685.46s -> 9687.46s]  where
[9687.46s -> 9692.95s]  You can't really blow the game open
[9693.03s -> 9694.31s]  Oh, i'm dead
[9694.31s -> 9695.43s]  maybe
[9695.43s -> 9697.43s]  Wait karma shield me i'm not dead
[9700.28s -> 9701.48s]  nice
[9701.48s -> 9705.43s]  fuck
[9721.48s -> 9724.28s]  Motherfucker co-read me man. Here is it like go we
[9726.88s -> 9734.29s]  We can fight this though. They have no ults
[9734.29s -> 9738.29s]  Like this is actually fightable. They have no Zyar and no, uh, Dragasar.
[9738.29s -> 9746.33s]  And this is also why it's really important that you relay to your team the cooldowns of your team.
[9746.33s -> 9751.33s]  Remember that. Don't forget that. If somebody uses a big cooldown, tell your team.
[9751.33s -> 9754.33s]  Because that was an illegal dragon, right? Like they just...
[9754.33s -> 9757.33s]  That was one of the most illegal things I've seen in a while.
[9757.33s -> 9760.33s]  Homie completely grieved that.
[9760.33s -> 9782.84s]  That's another very, very, very important thing that you need to take away from playing League
[9782.84s -> 9787.96s]  being like this is what I was saying about the team work and shit earlier being good at the game is a
[9787.96s -> 9793.80s]  lot of spreading knowledge as well right like if you were if your team doesn't know if a flash is
[9793.80s -> 9797.72s]  up or down you have to play completely differently right like you got to think about the game and
[9797.72s -> 9801.56s]  that in terms of that as well like how many times have you seen like you know you're like oh I
[9801.56s -> 9809.01s]  can walk up here if this guy can't flash ultimate or something right it happens all the time
[9812.36s -> 9832.08s]  I wonder if I can kill a duskblade zed I don't know I probably could uh I should go mad
[9832.08s -> 9838.45s]  What do you think about Teemo and other top lane as AD carry?
[9838.45s -> 9843.36s]  I play Teemo AD carry when I'm playing for fun sometimes.
[9843.36s -> 9844.86s]  It's okay.
[9844.86s -> 9855.65s]  Yo, go look on your game, man.
[9855.65s -> 9860.21s]  So, during the mid game is Caitlyn, a few things that I can kind of teach you.
[9860.21s -> 9862.21s]  This was kind of a boring lane phase, right?
[9862.21s -> 9864.29s]  Like, we didn't really do that much.
[9864.29s -> 9868.41s]  The lane phase was essentially just like, we died once and then, you know, everything,
[9868.41s -> 9870.41s]  all hell broke loose.
[9870.41s -> 9877.52s]  When you walk up to fights like this, make sure that you're putting traps down in places
[9877.52s -> 9884.72s]  where the enemy has to walk.
[9884.72s -> 9885.88s]  Just like that.
[9885.88s -> 9890.64s]  Playing, playing Caitlyn is not always about just like auto-ing and getting Qs and shits.
[9890.64s -> 9894.44s]  If you noticed during that fight I put two traps here, two traps here.
[9894.44s -> 9902.19s]  I forced the enemy team into like a location where they had to eat traps or they can't
[9902.19s -> 9903.47s]  find us, right?
[9903.47s -> 9909.54s]  And even if like they avoid the traps, they're still having to like move their
[9909.54s -> 9918.57s]  character in a very unique specific way that they probably don't want to do.
[9918.57s -> 9921.33s]  So you should always be thinking where should I put these traps down at the start of the
[9921.33s -> 9923.37s]  fight, not like how do I get autos off?
[9923.37s -> 9926.97s]  Think about using your traps to zone and to like control the teamfight before the fight
[9926.97s -> 9934.45s]  starts rather than using it to do damage because they'll step in the traps themselves.
[9934.45s -> 9939.17s]  People will just, people are stupid, they're bad, people aren't paying attention, everything.
[9939.17s -> 9940.17s]  I'm bad.
[9940.17s -> 9943.45s]  you know what I mean people can't pay attention to every bush that you're
[9943.45s -> 9947.57s]  putting traps in during a big fight it's it's too much attention span nobody
[9947.57s -> 9971.71s]  has it nice oh big tip for all the 80 carries in chat guys I'm tell you right
[9971.71s -> 9976.71s]  now once the 20 minute mark happens in league your junglers camps are no longer
[9976.71s -> 9981.71s]  his I know I know junglers are gonna hate me for this okay listen if you're a
[9981.71s -> 9984.55s]  jungle player you're like fuck this guy now I hate him listen you know
[9984.55s -> 9989.91s]  It's true. You know at 20 minutes your camps no longer like they're not yours anymore, man
[9989.99s -> 9997.51s]  Okay, like you you you are full items at this point. Okay, like I want to be honest you would I'm taking your camps
[9997.99s -> 10002.72s]  I'm trying to get my third item as fast as humanly possible
[10010.41s -> 10014.09s]  Because 80 carries spike on three items extremely hard
[10014.53s -> 10024.49s]  And I want to walk top, but we have no vision of this area. So it's a little scary
[10028.54s -> 10030.78s]  Like I said, I typically don't like to take
[10030.78s -> 10036.98s]  jungles camps early game ever because like that's why I say like at 20 minutes
[10036.98s -> 10041.06s]  usually you have two items at this point if you're like farming decent and you
[10041.06s -> 10044.90s]  know etc sometimes they'll be faster but usually it's around average of like
[10044.90s -> 10050.57s]  you'll have your items at this point always be tabbing to the teamfights
[10050.57s -> 10080.76s]  even if you're farming as well Zed is in this bush wait where is he wait I'm
[10080.76s -> 10093.81s]  stupid where'd he go oh he died I killed him wow I'm really smart I like didn't
[10093.81s -> 10108.04s]  notice that I killed that guy I'm so dumb 80 carry brain right boys I was like
[10108.04s -> 10121.60s]  playing that so scared too because I was like I was like easy there pull the
[10121.60s -> 10125.96s]  dragon out oh I asked this yesterday but what do you guys think the coolest
[10125.96s -> 10131.92s]  looking dragon is I swear it's the I think Mountain Drake looks fucking sick
[10131.92s -> 10171.80s]  Welcome to the time to push man right?
[10173.40s -> 10182.00s]  That's mainly because we are karma just got picked off and I don't want to give them the option of pushing the wave
[10182.00s -> 10207.54s]  So by pushing the lane nice by pushing the lane in it takes away an option for the enemy
[10208.18s -> 10210.58s]  That's something that a lot of people think like oh, I just want farm
[10210.58s -> 10214.98s]  I don't care about the farm right like when I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game
[10215.42s -> 10216.94s]  and I'm pushing like a
[10216.94s -> 10221.06s]  Mid mid wave in before a fight if we're just sieging around the Baron I
[10222.10s -> 10226.62s]  Having that wave pushed in gives them gives us another option. I'm like what we can do in the game
[10227.30s -> 10229.66s]  And it takes you three seconds to push it in so
[10230.50s -> 10232.50s]  If the fights already over and
[10233.38s -> 10240.42s]  You have time always be paying attention to like trying to push in waves so that you can create a little bit of that pressure
[10240.62s -> 10242.78s]  Yo, hey, thank you so much for the 14 man. Welcome back
[10243.70s -> 10246.18s]  What do I get next I kind of want to get BT
[10246.94s -> 10256.37s]  I'm gonna get BT. I could get Dom's but I think BT's better because the I already have over here, right?
[10256.37s -> 10262.09s]  So the shield from BT plus shield vote plus ie. I don't think I'll be able to die. Okay. I think I'm unkillable
[10262.73s -> 10265.11s]  Act actually like actually unkillable
[10265.81s -> 10269.41s]  So here I'm gonna actually give these camps the federal because he's literally pathing to them
[10269.41s -> 10271.41s]  I don't want to be an asshole, but
[10271.67s -> 10289.28s]  Wow, what just happened? I'm bad. I
[10290.56s -> 10292.78s]  Feel like I got hooked by clad
[10293.58s -> 10295.82s]  Oh, he flashed.
[10295.82s -> 10296.82s]  Okay.
[10296.82s -> 10301.34s]  I was like, I feel like what just happened was like I mispositioned because like I went
[10301.34s -> 10302.34s]  up here, right?
[10302.34s -> 10305.46s]  Like I ghosted one up here because there was two people here, two people here.
[10305.46s -> 10309.28s]  I put traps down these kind of sloppy traps and then I positioned here and then Kled
[10309.28s -> 10312.78s]  flashed Q'd me under the, yeah, okay, that makes sense.
[10312.78s -> 10315.92s]  I'm just bad.
[10315.92s -> 10326.11s]  It was okay though because if the entire enemy team has to literally like double
[10326.11s -> 10330.37s]  Flash on you to kill you under the turret and then your team follows up. It's not that big of a deal
[10331.09s -> 10333.09s]  Gale force would have saved me there though. Actually
[10334.45s -> 10340.50s]  Okay, Gale force totally would save me
[10341.42s -> 10343.42s]  Because he has serpents
[10345.69s -> 10350.41s]  Serpents definitely shits on Chilbo. I'm kind of stupid for going show about this game. I
[10353.09s -> 10358.89s]  Wanted to try it out because I when I before when I was playing Caitlyn like before the IE reworking everything everybody would go
[10358.89s -> 10363.55s]  Or there was like one guy in Challenger would go shield bow into shit every game
[10363.75s -> 10368.67s]  And I wanted to see if like it was still viable, but there might just be better options now like always scale force a
[10369.67s -> 10376.16s]  BT or something. Oh my god. I flashed late. I'm dead
[10379.03s -> 10382.53s]  Dude, I flashed late for some reason. I'm so dumb
[10383.27s -> 10385.27s]  my bad
[10385.57s -> 10387.27s]  I was given an B
[10387.27s -> 10389.27s]  Like my brain is moving slowly
[10389.99s -> 10391.99s]  Like I can feel it turning
[10391.99s -> 10393.99s]  I'm just playing bad
[10394.71s -> 10398.31s]  Like I was baiting the Kled to go in on me because karma was there
[10398.43s -> 10401.17s]  But what I need to do is I need to trap on top myself when he goes in
[10401.71s -> 10408.34s]  Then I need to flash knit and the Kled just dies. You can also just kill him. I
[10410.24s -> 10423.84s]  Was gonna say they have nothing we just play for dragon here. I don't know why I'm playing so bad today
[10423.84s -> 10427.48s]  I played bad yesterday, too. I don't know what's going on my like brain is broken
[10427.48s -> 10447.15s]  Dude that recon was trying so hard. Oh
[10482.45s -> 10490.35s]  I've made so many mistakes this game. I fucked up positioning mechanics farm
[10491.25s -> 10499.49s]  all kinds of shit
[10499.65s -> 10502.15s]  I still don't want Lord Dom's actually I
[10508.25s -> 10510.25s]  Don't think Lord Dom's is good this game
[10510.65s -> 10515.15s]  Like they have no armor like quite as murk treads
[10516.89s -> 10518.89s]  Which I feel like
[10519.85s -> 10534.88s]  Really bad indoor team, but oh a little tip that you guys can have for Caitlyn too when you are
[10536.00s -> 10538.00s]  Like Barons up in 50 seconds, right?
[10538.00s -> 10543.40s]  So a little thing you can do that's actually kind of fun is you want to be at the objective before the like
[10543.72s -> 10545.56s]  Rule with them one of the objectives coming up
[10545.56s -> 10548.32s]  You always want to be on that side of the map before the before the objective comes up
[10549.16s -> 10550.96s]  but
[10550.96s -> 10552.96s]  You can put down traps
[10553.76s -> 10555.76s]  in the bushes
[10555.76s -> 10559.44s]  Around the objectives and people will face check them and you can just one tap them away game
[10561.20s -> 10562.44s]  It's actually
[10562.44s -> 10563.64s]  Incredibly fun
[10563.64s -> 10569.62s]  Like you just put them in the corners of the bushes where people have to walk
[10570.18s -> 10590.92s]  Like right here. I can put it right between the turret. I don't know why I didn't ghost
[10592.04s -> 10599.37s]  I'll be honest. I have no idea why didn't ghost. I was like saving it for something. I'm not sure what
[10602.45s -> 10605.29s]  Next year a birthday present who the fuck knows. Oh
[10609.12s -> 10611.12s]  I could have one shot that guy if I was better at Kate
[10612.44s -> 10616.44s]  I did a really classic combo right there. I just didn't queue cuz I'm bad.
[10616.44s -> 10621.82s]  I should have, when he hit the trap, your two headshots, sit on him for a few seconds.
[10621.82s -> 10625.82s]  So what I should have done is I should have instantly queued on top of the trap, then auto-auto'd and he would have died.
[10625.82s -> 10631.82s]  Cuz your queue does the max damage when they're trapped too, so it would have been like just a perfect three-shot.
[10631.82s -> 10636.82s]  But like I said, I don't play Cait enough, and my muscle memories kind of trash sometimes, so...
[10636.82s -> 10638.82s]  That was my bad.
[10638.82s -> 10651.54s]  Oh, we're getting cluttered.
[10651.54s -> 10653.54s]  I don't know where he is, but...
[10653.54s -> 10678.83s]  I shouldn't have done that. I'm limit testing really hard right now. I suggest you guys don't limit test
[10678.83s -> 10680.33s]  Well, actually, I do think you should limit test
[10680.33s -> 10684.09s]  But not if you want to win like play safer like right there the play wasn't to go back in
[10684.41s -> 10687.61s]  The play was the like back off, but I wanted to see if I could like I
[10690.28s -> 10692.28s]  Wanted to see if I was terrible or not
[10693.28s -> 10695.04s]  You know I
[10695.04s -> 10697.04s]  was
[10697.32s -> 10702.68s]  But yeah, I mean the combo with Kate is like if they're trapped you want to queue while they're in the trap
[10702.68s -> 10708.24s]  essentially because your auto will always give you the range so if you auto and
[10708.24s -> 10715.44s]  then Q when they're trapped they get not a lot of people know this because I just
[10715.44s -> 10721.92s]  found this out like a few years or like after I should have when you Q on top of
[10721.92s -> 10726.60s]  a K trap the way k8s Q works is when you queue the initial like it hits
[10726.60s -> 10730.68s]  initially and then it does less damage to the targets behind it right it's
[10730.68s -> 10736.08s]  It's very narrow and then it gets bigger, so when they're trapped though, it does the
[10736.08s -> 10740.02s]  maximum Q damage that it can do in the isolation of the Q.
[10740.02s -> 10745.51s]  So that's why when people are trapped, you want to open up with your Q.
[10745.51s -> 10750.71s]  You either want to net into the Q and then double auto, or you want to net, or you
[10750.71s -> 10756.95s]  want to Q, then trap net at the same time, then double auto.
[10756.95s -> 10759.19s]  It's a very interesting way to play.
[10759.19s -> 10762.11s]  You always want to try and overlay a trap on your trap.
[10762.11s -> 10766.89s]  So when they get trapped, you can overlay a second trap to either in front of them or
[10766.89s -> 10767.89s]  behind them.
[10767.89s -> 10772.45s]  And what will happen is there's actually like a little mini, like I want to say one second
[10772.45s -> 10776.35s]  cooldown of being able to be trapped, right, like a little 1.52 second cooldown.
[10776.35s -> 10779.53s]  But what can happen is they sit in the trap, then what you can do is your net can slow
[10779.53s -> 10780.53s]  them.
[10780.53s -> 10785.17s]  So you can actually queue in the first trap, then you can drop a second trap,
[10785.17s -> 10788.41s]  net slow them into the second trap and then triple auto headshot them from all
[10788.41s -> 10791.15s]  three of the net, the two traps.
[10791.15s -> 10806.03s]  It's really complicated sounding, but this man does redeemed end my stream whenever you
[10806.03s -> 10812.82s]  want.
[10812.82s -> 10813.82s]  What?
[10813.82s -> 10817.35s]  Why?
[10817.35s -> 10824.09s]  Why would you want to end my stream right now?
[10824.09s -> 10838.07s]  Why would you want to be that guy?
[10838.07s -> 10839.07s]  Wow.
[10839.07s -> 10850.28s]  Okay.
[10850.28s -> 10854.68s]  Don't end, just change the camera position.
[10854.68s -> 10862.15s]  Did you just spend one million points to tell me to put the camera back on the right
[10862.15s -> 10868.40s]  side of my fucking-
[10868.92s -> 10870.92s]  No way
[10871.84s -> 10880.48s]  No way you just did that. I was like this man is just flexing
[10880.84s -> 10885.60s]  He's just like yeah, I got some points to spare. I guess I could like throw him, you know, uh
[10886.32s -> 10912.08s]  All right, fine. There's that better. Is that better drink water? Actually, that's a good one
[10912.08s -> 10917.29s]  I'll be our be I'm gonna get some water. Should we plan our main? I
[10917.85s -> 10919.85s]  Kind of want to try and hit GM
[10919.97s -> 10923.17s]  Yeah, let's get on our main account. It's like 1 p.m. So it's like 3 p.m. Eastern
[10923.33s -> 10932.55s]  I think I can get cues at the moments. Let me get some water and then we'll queue up
[10932.55s -> 10944.04s]  or we'll queue up then get some water real quick because I think it's late
[10944.04s -> 10953.36s]  enough in the day I can get cues now without waiting 40 minutes. By the way
[10953.36s -> 10957.40s]  it is it is a teaching stream when I'm doing that like 80 carry Academy thing
[10957.40s -> 10960.32s]  so if you guys have any questions you want to ask or like you guys can ignore
[10960.32s -> 10964.12s]  that if you guys have any questions you want to ask or anything like that you
[10964.12s -> 10966.64s]  know if we're just chilling between games just ask whatever you want I
[10966.64s -> 10973.10s]  I can answer a lot easier between games than I can in-game, you know, it's a lot easier for me to see that shit
[10973.10s -> 10977.64s]  I try and answer in-game, but like sometimes I'm like focusing and shit, so it's a little harder
[10984.69s -> 10988.01s]  I'm gonna get some water though, so I'll be right back. Okay?
[10989.09s -> 10991.09s]  Talk amongst yourselves
[10991.29s -> 10994.73s]  Is Kraken troll on Kate? No, Kraken's good on Kate
[10995.57s -> 10999.65s]  You can go Kraken into Bloodthirster or Kraken into IE if you really need it if
[10999.65s -> 11005.89s]  If they have like tanks, so they have like Scion, Sejuani, stuff like that, that you have to like,
[11005.89s -> 11009.49s]  you're the only damage, let's say you're like the only tank killer on the team, you're like the only
[11009.49s -> 11012.05s]  80 damage, you have to go Kraken sometimes.
[14810.29s -> 14817.29s]  .
[14817.29s -> 14821.66s]  .
[14821.66s -> 14825.66s]  .
[14825.66s -> 14829.66s]  .
[14829.66s -> 14834.66s]  .
[14834.66s -> 14840.66s]  .
[14840.66s -> 14872.31s]  look to like engage things like that right uh okay so this game uh as the support i need to be tracking
[14872.31s -> 14879.69s]  the jungler so i'm gonna think where always be thinking what the enemy jungler wants to accomplish
[14879.69s -> 14885.85s]  and how to stop it that's like a pretty big tip of advice i can give you guys like think to yourself
[14885.85s -> 14889.21s]  like okay if i was the enemy jungler what would i be wanting to do against this cramps right as
[14889.21s -> 14894.73s]  Lee Sin. He's probably going to want to either gank early, like gank bot early, or he wants to
[14897.61s -> 14900.89s]  invade on certain timers, right? Because that's like what Lee is really good at
[14901.45s -> 14909.37s]  is ganking and invading. So what I think I'm going to try to do this game is I'm going to try and
[14910.33s -> 14914.33s]  watch for early ganks and early pressure bot lane, like level two, level three ganks.
[14914.33s -> 14921.33s]  We're still gonna be aggressive, but Lux took TP, which means this Lux does not plan on playing aggressive at all.
[14921.33s -> 14929.33s]  Like she basically, if anybody takes TP like this in a lane, I already know from start of the game that they're not planning on doing anything.
[14929.33s -> 14934.33s]  So I'm probably gonna end up roaming a lot this game. This is gonna be a game where I roam a ton.
[14934.33s -> 14952.80s]  We do have some good lanes to roam too, too. Like roaming top and mid is both really good.
[14952.80s -> 14970.14s]  Just wanted to ward early because I don't want to get shit on badly
[14971.40s -> 14973.08s]  So
[14973.08s -> 14975.08s]  Okay, I'm just gonna flash immediately
[14976.00s -> 14980.16s]  There's no reason to not flash there because Alistar use this flash to get my flash
[14980.60s -> 14986.16s]  Which is totally fine. It's better for him because he has hex flash, but it's not that bad
[14990.54s -> 14993.70s]  Because I can outrange him and I can stay away from his
[14994.42s -> 14999.20s]  His shit, so we know he's in the bush. We just chill
[14999.20s -> 15002.72s]  There it is. He fucked up. Now we go forward. I
[15004.24s -> 15008.24s]  Don't know why Lux isn't throwing spells at this guy like I don't know why she didn't cue him
[15009.36s -> 15011.62s]  Like he fucked up the Alistar should have died there
[15013.08s -> 15014.72s]  And she's pinging me. Okay
[15014.72s -> 15018.96s]  The Alistar should have died there if Alistar ever fucks up on a gauge like that where he hex flashes in
[15019.28s -> 15023.04s]  Get stuck like he was cool down. Yeah, I don't know why it was thrown is what I'm saying
[15023.32s -> 15025.58s]  You don't throw you don't throw spells that
[15025.58s -> 15029.86s]  that aren't going to land.
[15029.86s -> 15034.42s]  So there's no point in Lux ever throwing her Q until Alistar fucks up the combo.
[15034.42s -> 15039.06s]  Like she should just poke with E and then because it's almost like a Blitz hook, right?
[15039.06s -> 15040.62s]  Think of it like a Blitz hook.
[15040.62s -> 15043.62s]  If she throws the Q out, right?
[15043.62s -> 15049.14s]  Now they have an opportunity to be aggressive because they know the hook is down.
[15049.14s -> 15053.98s]  So it's better for her to just hold the hook, essentially, right?
[15053.98s -> 15059.90s]  the queue and now when Alistar does go in they have to be nervous about that queue because
[15059.90s -> 15063.58s]  they can't just think oh the queue's down let's let's engage right so they can't actually
[15063.58s -> 15073.71s]  think about that this is why I don't like a lot of the time doing this like push push
[15073.71s -> 15085.27s]  the wave they can't engage on us without like flashing so it doesn't matter like luck
[15085.27s -> 15092.37s]  did she queue the wave again or am I an idiot like just oh man I'm losing my mind
[15092.37s -> 15098.67s]  tier. Oh, these, I'm, I'm tilting. It's fine. I need to not tilt. I need to just chill, but
[15098.67s -> 15103.41s]  I'm getting frustrated because we're like not using cooldowns properly and it's driving
[15103.41s -> 15110.72s]  me fucking crazy because these are very simple things to do. You guys got to walk the way
[15110.72s -> 15114.48s]  then by the way. You can't let them freeze. Okay. They're very simple things to do. I
[15114.48s -> 15117.76s]  know I'm being annoying as shit whining about this, but this is stuff that you,
[15117.76s -> 15121.08s]  you need to be thinking about when you're playing the game. Well, you should actively
[15121.08s -> 15129.48s]  be thinking, uh, what can I do with my champion's toolkit to stop their champion's toolkit?
[15129.48s -> 15132.78s]  And you should be thinking, okay, I have Q, right?
[15132.78s -> 15134.16s]  So what do they want to do?
[15134.16s -> 15136.28s]  They want to go in, okay?
[15136.28s -> 15141.62s]  And when you're thinking they want to go in, right?
[15141.62s -> 15145.38s]  You should be thinking, okay, when they go in, I can just Q.
[15145.38s -> 15147.96s]  And that should be your entire thought process.
[15147.96s -> 15153.34s]  Your thought process should never be, oh, maybe I can land a random Q at max range
[15153.34s -> 15158.78s]  And we can get a kill she cued the wave. Yes, that's what I mean like
[15159.62s -> 15163.58s]  You should never queue the wave on Lux either unless you're going to 100% reset
[15163.98s -> 15171.48s]  That would be like if I hooked the wave as like Blitzcrank or some shits. Why is my Lux bait pinging my graves?
[15172.16s -> 15175.68s]  Dude, I gotta keep this a hundred percent honest to the men
[15177.48s -> 15181.00s]  You don't get you you don't get to be mad here
[15181.88s -> 15184.00s]  Why are dude these players are such babies?
[15184.00s -> 15196.07s]  Jesus Christ what pussies man these people are such babies the graves played correctly by the way like a hundred percent
[15197.27s -> 15199.47s]  That he's mad at the graves for taking a wave
[15199.67s -> 15202.85s]  He wanted to not like he wanted to be able to TP back and get the wave
[15203.13s -> 15210.97s]  That's what this locks is so trash that she actually believes that's the graves faults that graves misplayed by pushing the bot wave
[15211.49s -> 15213.49s]  But it was the right play
[15213.49s -> 15218.53s]  Pushing the bot wave was the correct play there, because then she doesn't have to TP.
[15218.53s -> 15222.29s]  The whole reason that he's pushing it is to save her teleport, so that she doesn't have
[15222.29s -> 15227.92s]  to TP to lane.
[15227.92s -> 15231.80s]  Players like this are why the game is hard to play right now in the current meta.
[15231.80s -> 15233.64s]  Why it feels bad.
[15233.64s -> 15235.36s]  Because this Lux is trash.
[15235.36s -> 15237.12s]  You guys can all see this Lux is terrible.
[15237.12s -> 15240.04s]  She's already made a bunch of mistakes, she's blaming her team, she's being a
[15240.04s -> 15250.89s]  a dipshit, right? But she can climb up to this elo being this bad because of the system,
[15250.89s -> 15271.79s]  the current system in place. We should immediately do Baron here, Dragon. I mean, we should do
[15271.79s -> 15281.01s]  this. Come. You don't have time for this. Just come do Dragon. Bro, the leasing just
[15281.01s -> 15299.22s]  showed top. We should be doing Dragon. When this shit happens, by the way, where
[15299.22s -> 15304.62s]  you have enemy jungler shows on one side of the map you should always be playing
[15304.62s -> 15310.26s]  on the other side of the map to make a counter play so jungler shows on top side
[15310.26s -> 15319.82s]  we go for dragon right easy yo be careful Alistar is going to be there
[15319.82s -> 15325.75s]  Xerath's going to be there just leave just leave leave of leaf I'll do it for
[15325.75s -> 15331.54s]  you I'll make you leave I got you man but we had a timer just now where
[15331.54s -> 15335.66s]  their bot lane had to back and I need the back now but we had a timer just
[15335.66s -> 15339.66s]  where their bot lane had to back and not only did their bot lane have to back but
[15341.42s -> 15356.42s]  the enemy was top i i tried man i tried to flash q him but yeah it's it's really i don't know a
[15356.42s -> 15360.98s]  lot of junglers don't i don't think they know what they're oh i'm dead by the way i'm not even gonna
[15360.98s -> 15368.42s]  pop exhaust i'm just dead a lot of junglers don't know what the goal of the game actually is a
[15368.42s -> 15371.94s]  lot of them think it's i think that was a bad insect but a lot of junglers think the
[15371.94s -> 15375.70s]  The goal of the game is to like get as much farm as you can and run over the enemy team and shit
[15375.82s -> 15378.50s]  but it's actually it is but it's also about like
[15379.18s -> 15383.38s]  Getting early objectives and turning those small leads and a big leads through objective control
[15383.98s -> 15389.56s]  Right, so like right now. I want to rotate top. Rift is up
[15389.56s -> 15391.76s]  I know Lee Sin's gonna be on top side of the map right now
[15391.76s -> 15397.20s]  I want to rotate top so that I can help my team by being in the top side of the map
[15397.34s -> 15399.34s]  Because that's where the next play is gonna be made
[15399.76s -> 15406.04s]  Well the play is made mid, but I mean I'm here, so it's fine
[15406.04s -> 15429.60s]  oh my god I did not think the fucking Lee Sin would be there too oh oops this is
[15429.60s -> 15434.46s]  rough I don't really know how to how to play this because I got there in time to
[15434.46s -> 15440.24s]  counter the gank right I exhausted the guy saved the Zareth I got there in
[15440.24s -> 15450.46s]  time to counter the gank but ooh well played that's actually mega well played
[15450.46s -> 15466.86s]  That was really good. I want to push this wave in but I can't like you guys are
[15466.86s -> 15470.52s]  noticing there's no objectives taken on the map yet at 10 minutes which is kind
[15470.52s -> 15474.70s]  of crazy. The ally's doing really good. The ally's is not a bad support player
[15474.70s -> 15495.16s]  he's playing well. Like he's playing very well. A lot of this is more of like
[15495.16s -> 15499.66s]  I need I don't have anything to do on the map because I'm trying to help my
[15499.66s -> 15505.60s]  jungler but my jungler is trolling. It's really rough because like I'm
[15505.60s -> 15508.88s]  I'm trying to rotate over and help my jungler on cooldown basically, right?
[15508.88s -> 15511.20s]  But my jungler doesn't want to fight.
[15511.20s -> 15513.96s]  You see like I'm countering the Alistar's fight, their ganks.
[15513.96s -> 15524.72s]  It's just, I'm just dead.
[15524.72s -> 15525.72s]  Dude.
[15525.72s -> 15531.28s]  Like, we shouldn't have made that play mid because we knew that they were all there
[15531.28s -> 15535.28s]  and we knew that our jungler is doing this.
[15535.28s -> 15539.20s]  This might just be a jungle diff, honestly.
[15539.20s -> 15542.26s]  Like our AD carry sucks but it might just be a straight up jungle diff game.
[15542.26s -> 15547.86s]  They do happen, especially in this elo where jungle has so much control of the game.
[15547.86s -> 15553.52s]  They do happen.
[15553.52s -> 15554.92s]  It's a pretty big jungle diff, Chpapi.
[15554.92s -> 15555.92s]  You know it.
[15555.92s -> 15556.92s]  I know it.
[15556.92s -> 15559.20s]  Like yeah, he's saying yeah.
[15559.20s -> 15566.19s]  He knows the jungle is getting outclassed insanely hard.
[15566.19s -> 15567.71s]  Cause Graves counters Lee Sin.
[15567.71s -> 15571.85s]  It's a massive counter.
[15571.85s -> 15575.81s]  But this guy doesn't know what he's doing.
[15575.81s -> 15578.93s]  I think he's a Rengar one trick and Rengar got banned.
[15578.93s -> 15581.53s]  I think that's what's going on.
[15581.53s -> 15587.93s]  Rengar one trick who got banned out and he tried to play a champion that requires thought not just a I jump you die champ
[15589.09s -> 15599.30s]  Right, and he just gets shit on for it. I mean dude, I can't even I can't even do anything this game
[15600.64s -> 15610.17s]  Our top laner is getting his ass whipped to it's really fucking rough. I mean he's in here. I'm pretty sure
[15610.91s -> 15613.19s]  It's not it was just it was warded though. I
[15614.35s -> 15617.15s]  Mean we can't really do anything here. I'm dead. I think
[15617.99s -> 15619.99s]  Yeah, I'm just dead
[15620.23s -> 15624.35s]  This is just rough. I I kind of want to go next because I don't think I
[15625.11s -> 15627.41s]  Don't think we have the skill on the team to win
[15629.17s -> 15634.23s]  The jungle depth is huge the 80 diff is huge and I'm just I can't I can't impact the map
[15634.87s -> 15651.58s]  Like I can't I just can't do anything this game to impact the map and it feels really bad. Oh
[15662.63s -> 15664.63s]  Son of a bitch I should have flashed I
[15667.66s -> 15671.18s]  Got like creep walked a little bit when he knocked me in I like had to walk through I should just flashed up
[15671.18s -> 15672.10s]  That's my man
[15672.10s -> 15675.34s]  Like what was that TP man? Oh God get me out
[15675.74s -> 15679.48s]  I'm gonna be a hundred percent real get me out that TP was miserably bad
[15680.22s -> 15682.22s]  Dude just TP'd to the wave
[15690.68s -> 15692.84s]  Like what is our blocks doing to like I?
[15693.84s -> 15695.96s]  Just feel like everybody's late to the fights
[15697.60s -> 15699.60s]  Lux is always late to the fights
[15700.04s -> 15703.92s]  The graves doesn't want to take fights even though he's playing graves into Lee Sin
[15704.64s -> 15707.62s]  Like I feel like ooh this is rough. This is a rough game
[15708.52s -> 15710.56s]  Games like this tilt me and I kind of just want to go next
[15710.56s -> 15715.80s]  Because games like this they are winnable, but I feel like I want to go next to save mental, you know
[15716.64s -> 15718.88s]  Like low key. I just want to save my mental
[15728.84s -> 15730.84s]  Because oh, it's so gross
[15732.36s -> 15736.88s]  Like watching what Lux did in the early stages of the lane phase just wasting her Q on repeat
[15737.00s -> 15741.76s]  That was one of the most embarrassing things ever and then like look at that. She just Q'd a minion
[15753.20s -> 15756.57s]  Oh
[15756.57s -> 15760.49s]  Bro, like oh my god, you gotta push the wave man. Oh
[15760.49s -> 15780.38s]  holy shits I mean I can't even walk oh my god I don't even have help from my
[15780.38s -> 15790.50s]  fucking team that's the worst part about this dude these games feel so
[15790.50s -> 15795.78s]  unplayable man like I don't know how else to say it except for they just
[15795.78s -> 15802.38s]  feel miserable to play like I'm trying to focus on playing like improving
[15802.38s -> 15808.98s]  myself but it's so hard to know how to improve in games where like you genuinely
[15808.98s -> 15819.67s]  just get no help. My Lux has been tilted since like minute two for some reason and
[15819.67s -> 15825.51s]  my Graves has been completely pathing wrong doing wrong shit. It's hard to
[15825.51s -> 15829.11s]  know how to help like I went mid to help, countered two of the early ganks.
[15829.11s -> 15835.72s]  Lux still griefed the game so like yeah it's just it's hard to know and then
[15835.72s -> 15848.99s]  top lane lost. It's so rough, man. Like, I'm gonna keep it 100% honest with you. If you
[15848.99s -> 15859.54s]  are a one trick, do not try and play other champs. You will int. You will play badly
[15859.54s -> 15866.94s]  always and you will int. And you will, you will, like, look at this. This is 2.9k damage
[15866.94s -> 15876.78s]  as a, dude, like what are we doing? How are these people getting into this elo? How
[15876.78s -> 15880.58s]  How does this locks like in the game?
[15880.58s -> 15889.14s]  She was against an Alistair bot and she did 1.2.9k damage in a 16 minute game against
[15889.14s -> 15892.34s]  a melee heavy team.
[15892.34s -> 15893.34s]  Like what is this?
[15893.34s -> 15895.40s]  What is happening?
[15895.40s -> 15903.65s]  This guy was d4, 30 LP last season and now he's magically in Masters?
[15903.65s -> 15910.71s]  No, we need to fix matchmaking.
[15910.71s -> 15917.54s]  This is insane.
[15917.54s -> 15920.86s]  This is just a matchmaking diff, it's nothing else.
[15920.86s -> 15927.62s]  My man literally does not belong in Master Tier 400LP MMR at all.
[15927.62s -> 15929.38s]  You can see that he's not at this level.
[15929.38s -> 15949.01s]  Dude, I have the Lux player on my team again.
[15949.01s -> 15954.97s]  Ugh.
[15954.97s -> 15962.01s]  There's a Zerath one trick and a Rengar one trick on the enemy team.
[15962.01s -> 15963.81s]  I don't know man.
[15963.81s -> 15970.86s]  I guess I care more about the Rengar than the Zerath, but this is rough.
[15970.86s -> 15984.25s]  Oh, what's up Chippapi?
[15984.25s -> 15988.17s]  Dude, sorry, I hit yes on that man. I know the game was winnable. I'm gonna be real
[15988.45s -> 15993.61s]  But dude, you didn't see what I saw during the early game of that game to Bobby like man
[15994.17s -> 15998.76s]  The entire early game of that game was like
[15999.36s -> 16001.42s]  We lost Lane
[16001.42s -> 16007.76s]  Because Lux wouldn't use her Q to fight the Alistar. She was using it to farm minions
[16009.00s -> 16012.76s]  Like she was so scared of being engaged on by the Alistar and the Calista
[16012.76s -> 16019.12s]  that she would use her Q to max range farm minions instead of save it so when
[16019.12s -> 16024.20s]  the Alistar engages we just kill him right because if Alistar ever engages on
[16024.20s -> 16028.44s]  me in Lux he just gets killed we just bind him walk away and he's stuck there
[16028.44s -> 16035.40s]  and he dies right but for some reason she didn't understand how to do that so
[16035.40s -> 16038.68s]  she was just throwing it to farm so we would just get engaged on so I started
[16038.68s -> 16042.12s]  roaming and every time I was like roaming to an objective or something
[16042.12s -> 16047.40s]  The graves would always walk away and not fight like he wasn't attempting to fight
[16047.40s -> 16049.60s]  He was basically just like oh, I'm gonna go farm some more
[16049.64s -> 16053.52s]  But I'm like dude you can't do that like if the Alistar is ganking mid and I'm countering mid
[16053.52s -> 16058.20s]  You can't just farm farm before coming mid or you can't just like not take dragon and shit like that right like
[16058.48s -> 16064.20s]  It blows my mind that these players can get like it's like this guy too same thing like that jungler last game right?
[16064.72s -> 16068.64s]  Look at this. It's the same thing as the last game like NA is riddled with this shit
[16068.64s -> 16074.52s]  It's so miserable to play look at this this jungler last game, right? He's not he's what like a d1 player, right?
[16074.52s -> 16077.92s]  He's not a bad player he peeps d1, but why is this guy in this game now?
[16078.12s -> 16084.40s]  He like artificially inflated to the silo getting lucky with his first few games and now we have to play with this guy
[16084.40s -> 16089.51s]  Oh, it's an account share the person
[16089.87s -> 16093.11s]  It's a different player look on the account
[16094.79s -> 16098.36s]  D flash f flash so
[16098.36s -> 16104.47s]  So, uh, it's a fucking account share, that's, that's frustrating.
[16112.04s -> 16115.24s]  Sorry for whining so much, guys. This shit's just really frustrating to me.
[16116.64s -> 16120.54s]  Like, I know I should play it to, like, specifically only care about, like, improving,
[16120.54s -> 16123.24s]  and then while you're improving, you'll climb automatically and shit,
[16123.54s -> 16125.64s]  but it's really frustrating when, like,
[16127.24s -> 16131.54s]  the players in the game would rather be idiots and assholes to each other than play the game.
[16131.74s -> 16134.14s]  Right? Like, the game before, the Amumu, right?
[16134.14s -> 16136.54s]  The game before this, the Amumu was just being toxic the whole game,
[16136.54s -> 16140.94s]  and entered the win away. The last game, the Lux and the Graves were being toxic to each other,
[16140.94s -> 16148.30s]  the whole game, we entered the game away. It's like, it's not fun to lose because one player
[16148.30s -> 16156.99s]  gets mad at another player over them both being idiots. I'm sorry, it's not fun. It's so unfun.
[16158.43s -> 16175.52s]  But we'll try and win this one. All we can really do is try and carry the games, right?
[16175.52s -> 16195.42s]  it's about it what is what what man what what do you think they're gonna do to me welcome
[16195.42s -> 16200.34s]  to the league of yeah I think of the seven months man welcome back I really don't want
[16200.34s -> 16204.58s]  to meet all I don't I don't want to meet all because like I want to like value the
[16204.58s -> 16220.01s]  penguins and shit but dude if they walk up I'm gonna flank them that's why I'm standing
[16220.01s -> 16256.40s]  here okay there in a minute well that was a big cue I need to get level two first
[16256.40s -> 16280.53s]  here 100% Ash should have just been autoing there that whole time because we
[16280.53s -> 16284.89s]  have heal so she should have just walked up and autoed as soon as this is what I
[16284.89s -> 16289.53s]  mean by tracking cooldowns as soon as the Nico missed her as soon as the Nico
[16289.53s -> 16293.97s]  missed her cooldown soon she missed her E the Ash should have just walked up
[16293.97s -> 16298.73s]  and immediately started fighting right like because they can no longer kill us
[16298.73s -> 16305.83s]  the Niko doesn't actually have spells outside of her E right so she misses
[16305.83s -> 16310.51s]  that snare and she used her W too right so it's like we just go ham you don't
[16310.51s -> 16315.91s]  need to be too scared it happens quite a bit sometimes where people will just be
[16315.91s -> 16338.14s]  like really nervous damn if I had dodged that Q I actually would have
[16338.14s -> 16342.18s]  killed all three damn I don't know if it was worth the flash after the
[16342.18s -> 16345.16s]  I actually I think it was if I had dodged the queue I would have been fine
[16346.16s -> 16352.00s]  So that was that it's whatever. I also doesn't miss any creeps here. So it's not the end of the world
[16352.56s -> 16359.41s]  Like I'm pretty sure Lee Sin did not have his top camps by the way
[16366.57s -> 16369.29s]  Damn if I was a little better mechanically I turned that by the way
[16370.65s -> 16373.80s]  100%
[16373.80s -> 16400.28s]  We should push this wave so that I can go get vision because yeah that guy can't freeze that wave so
[16403.32s -> 16416.17s]  Sounds too bad
[16416.17s -> 16434.57s]  recent top you can kind of see some really good uh what is this why is my car this afk turret
[16439.18s -> 16468.70s]  what is happening right now why was he afk i mean i guess it worked out but yeah maybe you had to
[16468.70s -> 16483.58s]  go let his cat out i don't know happens we do their bot lane is not very good they're trying
[16483.58s -> 16491.56s]  too hard to force fights that they can't win like they they genuinely can't win half these
[16491.56s -> 16495.40s]  fights that they're trying to force. Maybe if they were against people who like
[16495.40s -> 16498.40s]  don't push their buttons they could win those but it's like all I have to do is
[16498.40s -> 16502.40s]  stand there and fight back and they lose. They're on dragon a thousand percent
[16502.40s -> 16506.92s]  right now. There's not a lot I can do about that. We just have to chill.
[16506.92s -> 16511.00s]  There's almost nothing I can do about it. Kaisa's trying to fake act like
[16511.00s -> 16520.36s]  she's big but it's just there's just nothing we can do because our card
[16520.36s -> 16529.19s]  This is top so we just chill I finished the cheerless no no no not yet
[16530.55s -> 16533.87s]  Whoa
[16533.87s -> 16535.87s]  Lee sin could be bought right now
[16537.55s -> 16541.83s]  Mmm, I don't think it's too bad if he's bought though. They can't really dive us especially with card this ult
[16556.98s -> 16559.10s]  Why why does my ash just run?
[16560.18s -> 16567.76s]  She like just straight up runs away. It's kind of silly
[16576.84s -> 16581.64s]  Cuz we have we have card this ulti like we can win that five of earth we can win a fight bot right now
[16581.64s -> 16588.80s]  I guess I guess I'm just gonna have to get them low enough for Karthus to kill them
[16590.30s -> 16592.50s]  Like without the ashes help
[16593.66s -> 16595.66s]  Which I think I can do it's not too bad
[16597.57s -> 16599.57s]  Okay, the Akali's coming bot
[16600.41s -> 16612.72s]  We just killed him. I mean, let's just fight. I don't know why we just ash arrow. Honestly
[16613.56s -> 16621.47s]  Just ash arrow
[16621.47s -> 16623.47s]  Okay, that was pretty bad ash arrow, but
[16630.52s -> 16633.64s]  Filled I don't think he's filled. I think he's just having a bad game
[16633.64s -> 16638.64s]  I got the it happens, you know, whoa, okay
[16639.56s -> 16644.64s]  Do it ult me. I fucking dare you
[16645.52s -> 16651.26s]  Trying to keep some mana
[16651.46s -> 16653.46s]  So that I can ulti
[16666.92s -> 16677.36s]  Carter's already used his ults fuck. They both backed there. Wow
[16678.26s -> 16684.20s]  My bad. I honestly didn't think they were both gonna back there
[16684.84s -> 16689.58s]  Like I thought the kaisa was gonna back right where I saw her like last
[16690.66s -> 16693.46s]  That was my bad. Hmm. I should be
[16694.30s -> 16701.40s]  I think Lee Sin can come bot here and kill me. I should actually stop this guy's back
[16702.08s -> 16712.37s]  Yeah, I should stop his back because it's more value to stop the back now even if Lee Sin isn't bot it's more value
[16713.57s -> 16715.57s]  Cuz he's so low
[16716.45s -> 16718.95s]  Collie is Mia though, so we got to be care I
[16720.69s -> 16723.33s]  Wasted my ult though, which makes me kind of scared
[16723.81s -> 16726.93s]  The other thing that kind of sucks about this is we don't have good vision
[16726.93s -> 16737.43s]  And I can't really help anybody on the map because the same thing is happening as before
[16738.51s -> 16746.86s]  We're like we're missing opportunities to get kills on timers. I mean the dog lighting guy's playing fine this game
[16746.86s -> 16751.08s]  I think he's trolled a lot like he's he's trolling. This isn't like his best game
[16752.24s -> 16756.36s]  But it's also I don't know why we're getting so tilted around the map right now
[16757.00s -> 16759.96s]  Because if I'm if I'm being honest, we should just win the game off of like
[16761.52s -> 16774.82s]  Being better players. I don't know what this car. This is thinking but
[16775.20s -> 16781.91s]  Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.
[16781.91s -> 16787.24s]  Guard this. We can fight. We can fight. Just fight.
[16787.24s -> 16789.24s]  Bro, what are we doing?
[16790.24s -> 16793.24s]  I'm losing it, man. Ah, no, no, no. I'm tilted.
[16793.24s -> 16799.24s]  I'm tilted as fuck. He didn't walk in. Just go on to the Akali Shroud, man.
[16800.24s -> 16804.24s]  Well, just walk a foot to your right and stand on the Akali Shroud.
[16804.24s -> 16812.67s]  She just eats your damage while she's in the Shroud. She can't stop that.
[16812.67s -> 16814.67s]  Holy shit, I'm losing my minds
[16816.64s -> 16820.76s]  Like Ash is just inting bot waves right now not trying to do anything
[16822.20s -> 16826.72s]  Walks is really far up on CS, which is really good, but I'm losing it man
[16828.52s -> 16830.96s]  Like we see exactly where they are every game
[16831.36s -> 16837.06s]  Like we see where everybody is on the enemy team permanently and we still can't manage to like walk to the right location
[16837.80s -> 16841.74s]  This is driving me crazy
[16841.74s -> 16846.24s]  My my Carthus 80 my Carthus jungles getting out farmed
[16846.88s -> 16850.70s]  Like a Carthus jungles getting out farmed by a Lee Sin jungle. That's insane
[16851.64s -> 16854.72s]  Like I don't think I don't think I can stress enough how crazy that is
[16857.46s -> 16860.46s]  Like there should never be a world where Carthus ever gets out farms
[16865.37s -> 16867.37s]  No way
[16867.39s -> 16874.59s]  I'm dead dude. No way. I just fucking ate the end of that now. I'm playing that just kill the Lee Sin man
[16875.91s -> 16886.14s]  I fucked up there
[16886.94s -> 16890.80s]  That was my fault because I got hit by the tip of the that was my fault
[16890.80s -> 16894.44s]  I got barely clipped by the tip of the Niko ult when I was trying to space because I'm bad
[16895.28s -> 16898.60s]  And if I was alive there, and I could have saved my flash for the Lee Sin Q
[16898.60s -> 16905.29s]  We just win. I am confused that why we decided to like not fight that immediately though
[16906.33s -> 16909.77s]  Like we caught out two of their members and we just got scared for whatever reason
[16910.45s -> 16912.29s]  Wait, we win this fight
[16912.29s -> 16914.29s]  With thousand percent win this fight this fight this fight this
[16928.70s -> 16931.30s]  Bro do not throw a fucking temper tantrum right now
[16931.34s -> 16941.21s]  there's one kill do not throw a temper tantrum oh my god here we go I took one
[16941.21s -> 16953.76s]  kill the guy's about to lose his mind guys I need to mute all I'm gonna mute
[16953.76s -> 16962.38s]  all in a second like I can't with these people right now but I can't man you
[16962.38s -> 16968.70s]  people are disgusting like you guys just whine you play bad you whine and
[16968.70s -> 16972.22s]  you bitch about every little mistake that everything happens even though it's
[16972.22s -> 16978.56s]  Like in the middle of a fight, I guarantee I'm a better player than you are and you're still whining and crying over one shutdown that like
[16979.08s -> 16985.30s]  You didn't even walk to until I spam pinged you like I literally 1v2ed them you hit one e and now you're mad
[16988.09s -> 16990.97s]  Dude, I swear league players are fucking psychopaths
[16991.69s -> 16998.47s]  At least I got the exhaust off surely. She dies right?
[16999.19s -> 17002.17s]  Surely she dies here or not. Okay?
[17003.35s -> 17005.35s]  Okay, at least she died
[17005.99s -> 17007.99s]  Help each other guys
[17008.23s -> 17020.47s]  help each other teamwork teamwork teamwork teamwork teamwork wait this Ash is
[17020.47s -> 17030.05s]  insane okay I'm not gonna lie that Ash played that so good I only saw the end of
[17030.05s -> 17036.97s]  it and she still played that good that was sick well well done that was actually
[17036.97s -> 17049.02s]  really good she almost stopped the dive that's crazy this game is definitely
[17049.02s -> 17055.70s]  1,000% still winnable though. We just have to play for late game and not lose our fucking minds
[17055.70s -> 17059.44s]  I'll let that push back into my ash. I'll go mid and get some vision
[17062.22s -> 17064.22s]  That's pretty much all we have to do
[17064.68s -> 17075.46s]  Play for late and not lose our mind early. We could play to kill this Akali right now. She doesn't know there's no ward here
[17076.78s -> 17082.89s]  We could also invade here. Oh, that's so unlucky
[17084.33s -> 17086.33s]  That was such a close queue
[17086.41s -> 17113.66s]  kill that guy
[17113.66s -> 17121.23s]  Jesus Christ, I feel like we should have won that fight. I
[17121.97s -> 17123.87s]  Thought something awkward happened and we lost
[17124.75s -> 17131.67s]  Did my ash just walk directly into the sacali and not use her ulti use your ulti you have ulti use your ulti
[17132.47s -> 17141.78s]  Oh my god
[17141.78s -> 17145.41s]  What the fuck? Oh?
[17145.73s -> 17147.73s]  Oh my god. I
[17148.85s -> 17152.49s]  Don't even know what to say right now. This is insane
[17152.49s -> 17158.09s]  this genuinely feels like everybody in the game is losing their mind in the
[17158.09s -> 17165.46s]  freest game I've ever seen in my life like that's what we're losing to right
[17165.46s -> 17171.14s]  there that guy the guy who like doesn't understand how Senna works like that
[17171.14s -> 17176.30s]  player that's why I'm frustrated like that player right there has no idea how
[17176.30s -> 17182.18s]  Senna works tries to fight me and we're like losing to that guy like I'm
[17182.18s -> 17184.70s]  trying really hard not to be an asshole but like it's flooding out
[17184.70s -> 17195.20s]  right now from these games it's crazy but he's so toxic look at this he went
[17195.20s -> 17202.80s]  proto belt I only a boot Nico but like what that doesn't do anything to help
[17202.80s -> 17224.54s]  his team you could arrow that guy I mean it's not impossible or don't that's fine
[17224.54s -> 17249.51s]  oh my god guys I think my locks is AFK she's been sitting in base for like
[17249.51s -> 17261.91s]  five minutes. I think she's like literally just throwing or some shits. Alright let's push this way.
[17273.36s -> 17285.91s]  We could make a pick right now. Jax what are you doing man? Why are you up there? Oh no. Also
[17285.91s -> 17297.40s]  why does this Ashe have the worst build I've ever seen? Dude if we lose to the Kaisa that just
[17297.40s -> 17318.08s]  did that I'm gonna lose my mind. Like that guy just blind art in without any vision of anybody
[17318.08s -> 17329.39s]  and just died there's no way we can lose this we got this guys just play like I
[17329.39s -> 17333.89s]  just need to I need help getting vision control on Baron and mid and then we can
[17333.89s -> 17418.33s]  we can win we got this right now I mean we still got Baron but he did get two of
[17418.33s -> 17425.44s]  them I guess or no we only yeah you got a card this is an ash but we did get
[17425.44s -> 17436.49s]  Baron, which is very nice. I'm gonna go Dom's this game normally go
[17438.89s -> 17457.32s]  Black Cleaver, but I think I'm gonna go Dom's. I need to get vision control on dragon and mid
[17457.32s -> 17473.21s]  I need to get vision control and I need I need help to do it though
[17474.33s -> 17476.33s]  I'm gonna act like I'm backing here
[17476.93s -> 17486.58s]  We should just be pushing mid with Baron. I don't know what we're doing
[17488.10s -> 17491.30s]  Like like low key it should just be straight up like we go mid with Baron here
[17491.30s -> 17504.97s]  What the fuck was that? That was a terrible play.
[17504.97s -> 17524.10s]  Guys, just come mid. We have Baron.
[17524.10s -> 17536.12s]  Nice. Huge pick. Push mid, push mid.
[17536.12s -> 17538.68s]  Fuck dragon, just push mid.
[17538.68s -> 17552.82s]  Okay, now we back off. Oh, I mean, that was...
[17552.82s -> 17559.44s]  bad. Guys, back off. Back off, back off. Leave.
[17559.44s -> 17562.32s]  Leave, leave, leave, please. Please just leave.
[17562.32s -> 17568.90s]  Guys, you can leave. You can leave. We can just go do dragon.
[17568.90s -> 17575.48s]  Leave. We still have so much gold to get on the map. We can go get bot
[17575.48s -> 17581.24s]  tier 2, bot tier 1, bot tier 2, we have so much gold to get on the map it's not a big
[17581.24s -> 17584.28s]  deal right, like we don't need to end the game right this second.
[17584.28s -> 17590.04s]  We actually have Karthus and we have Jax too so like our scaling is really good.
[17590.04s -> 17639.06s]  I need to go get, I need to go get my next item but I need enough gold to do it.
[17639.06s -> 17641.26s]  I also need to go get wards.
[17641.26s -> 17644.30s]  This sucks I'm on like a weird buy timer where like I don't have enough things
[17644.30s -> 17645.30s]  to get.
[17645.30s -> 17647.30s]  You know what? I'm just gonna get my ward item.
[17648.02s -> 17651.10s]  I'm gonna grab this for right now just so we can actually get some power on the map.
[17651.78s -> 17656.90s]  Because the map's so dark and I think getting the ward item before finishing my last whisper item is probably the smartest call.
[17656.90s -> 17666.60s]  I am a little concerned why we're not pushing bot with Jax. We're pushing top.
[17668.32s -> 17670.32s]  And I'm also concerned why we're not
[17671.04s -> 17674.32s]  playing for mid Pryo, and we're just farming bot side.
[17675.76s -> 17677.76s]  This is such an awkward fucking thing.
[17677.76s -> 17686.86s]  Like we should just be playing for mid Pryo and use the arrow to engage
[17687.36s -> 17690.44s]  That's how we win. We just use arrow to engage when they contest mid
[17691.24s -> 17699.42s]  It's actually that easy
[17699.42s -> 17701.42s]  Like low-key. It's actually that easy
[17701.82s -> 17718.71s]  See watch now this guy's dead. I mean that's fine with me
[17720.23s -> 17722.39s]  You guys want to int to kill me that's totally fine
[17723.39s -> 17738.16s]  They can get the inhib and then they can back up
[17739.32s -> 17741.32s]  Yeah, I get in here back up
[17741.92s -> 17743.92s]  And then play for play for Baron
[17743.92s -> 17751.24s]  They'll only have a few seconds to do this though, so it's kind of scary because these two are gonna be alive
[17752.44s -> 17759.21s]  They need to back immediately
[17759.65s -> 17766.05s]  Just reset. You don't need the wave just leave leave leave
[17766.61s -> 17769.01s]  Barons up burns up think about the macro as the macro
[17769.85s -> 17771.53s]  We play for Baron now
[17771.53s -> 17780.12s]  Because there's a timer now where like you guys just need to reset because there's a timer where the enemy has tempo on the map
[17780.12s -> 17782.12s]  and if we don't
[17782.68s -> 17784.68s]  If we don't allow
[17784.68s -> 17788.68s]  If we don't reset they'll just rush Baron and there's nothing we can do about it.
[17788.68s -> 17800.99s]  Okay they're not on Baron. I think they missed their timer.
[17800.99s -> 17806.68s]  They're on it. No they're on it. They're on it. They're on it. Okay they're not on it. We're fun.
[17806.68s -> 17815.09s]  We can still fight this though but we need everybody here.
[17815.09s -> 17824.52s]  Just arrow. Arrow Ash. Arrow. Arrow.
[17824.52s -> 17829.52s]  Arrow it doesn't matter if you hit mouth. Just arrow. Just arrow him. Thank you.
[17829.52s -> 17837.80s]  No guys the back line. The back line.
[17837.80s -> 17842.82s]  Play together. Play together. Yes!
[17842.82s -> 17845.32s]  Nice!
[17845.32s -> 17852.53s]  End of the game!
[17852.53s -> 17854.09s]  You end, you end here.
[17854.09s -> 17856.73s]  Lux, don't back!
[17856.73s -> 17857.73s]  You are giving me cancer.
[17857.73s -> 17858.73s]  Okay, they forfeit it.
[17858.73s -> 17861.21s]  Dude, look how easy that is!
[17861.21s -> 17865.05s]  Look how easy it is to win games when people are listening to macro.
[17865.05s -> 17866.25s]  Look how easy it is!
[17866.25s -> 17869.25s]  Oh my god!
[17869.25s -> 17870.25s]  I'm losing it, man.
[17870.25s -> 17871.97s]  I swear to god I'm losing my hair.
[17871.97s -> 17873.57s]  I can feel my hair falling out right now.
[17873.57s -> 17876.29s]  I can feel it falling out of my fucking head.
[17876.29s -> 17877.45s]  Like I just lost the one.
[17877.45s -> 17885.93s]  right there look like it's just fucking kill me man in game god it's so hard I
[17885.93s -> 17896.04s]  feel so exhausted like it's so exhausting you played a 44 minute
[17896.04s -> 17905.12s]  gold game god damn that's impressive I don't want to honor any of these people
[17905.12s -> 17909.88s]  who would you guys honor like out of all of them who'd you guys pick cuz I don't
[17909.88s -> 17916.76s]  know they also in my eyes I'm too toxic right now they all suck jacks all
[17916.76s -> 17927.84s]  I'll give it to Jax. Ash. Ash was trying. I'll give you that. Ash was trying. Dude, look at this luxe
[17929.08s -> 17939.51s]  This luxe got so fucking carried. Oh my god. Oh my god
[17940.91s -> 17944.59s]  Don't type to me you pedestrian
[17962.64s -> 17965.76s]  Yeah, yeah, wow fucking pedestrian like
[17965.76s -> 17988.00s]  It's not even an insult man.
[17988.00s -> 17988.84s]  Dude.
[17990.12s -> 17993.36s]  Guys, I feel like part of my life gets taken away, you know?
[17995.00s -> 17996.28s]  Like when I play on my main account
[17996.28s -> 17998.44s]  and I'm like super sweaty, tryharding and shit,
[17998.44s -> 18000.48s]  I feel like I'm losing, like, yeah,
[18000.48s -> 18003.22s]  it's like every time I lose, it's like one hair.
[18003.22s -> 18005.32s]  Or like every time I'm like barely win.
[18005.32s -> 18007.76s]  Right, it's just like every game in this elo is like,
[18007.76s -> 18010.08s]  one hair on my head gets fucking burnt out
[18010.08s -> 18011.12s]  and it just leaves.
[18011.12s -> 18032.67s]  And I'm not like, I'm gonna be like Homer Simpson.
[18032.67s -> 18035.15s]  Like, look at the difference in Ward's place.
[18035.15s -> 18038.63s]  This is what annoys me about bad support players.
[18038.63s -> 18040.03s]  This guy placed 23.
[18041.43s -> 18043.99s]  He's more focused on getting kills than placing Ward's
[18043.99s -> 18051.22s]  and it's really stupid.
[18051.22s -> 18053.06s]  Sorry, I just don't, like I don't have anything
[18053.06s -> 18055.22s]  against the dog lightning guy as a person
[18055.22s -> 18058.50s]  other than like what I've seen on his stream, right?
[18058.50s -> 18062.16s]  Like on his stream, he just seems really egotistical.
[18063.26s -> 18065.10s]  Like he's like everything I hate
[18065.10s -> 18066.86s]  in the average league player.
[18066.86s -> 18073.86s]  He has a massive ego because he reached challenger on the support role on like an off meta pick
[18073.86s -> 18077.94s]  like last year at some point or something or maybe he's challenger right now I don't even know
[18077.94s -> 18080.54s]  maybe he has an account in challenger I don't even know
[18080.54s -> 18087.24s]  but it drives me crazy because like he doesn't do anything correctly
[18087.24s -> 18089.92s]  like he gets away with such dumb shit
[18089.92s -> 18095.04s]  because he like he like basically wins lane because he plays extremely aggressively
[18095.04s -> 18099.92s]  But, if you guys noticed in that game, the reason we won lane or we were able to push back
[18099.92s -> 18104.56s]  is because they played aggressively, but they did it really stupidly.
[18104.56s -> 18107.28s]  Like, they were fighting us in our own waves.
[18107.28s -> 18110.20s]  Right, like on repeat they were just fighting us in our own waves.
[18110.20s -> 18114.36s]  Every time I would just turn a 1 for 1, almost a 1 for 2 every time.
[18114.36s -> 18118.12s]  And it's stupid because every time that's happening they're also giving me souls, right?
[18118.12s -> 18122.08s]  And he would like take weird fights and like, I know he's probably 4th-bunny and he doesn't care,
[18122.08s -> 18126.08s]  It's a smurf blah blah blah, but I just don't like when people like that like ego their ass off
[18126.88s -> 18128.88s]  When they play so badly
[18129.40s -> 18137.07s]  It drives me crazy. Why do I care so much? I don't know I
[18137.85s -> 18160.52s]  Don't know how you guys doing by the way
[18161.16s -> 18164.28s]  How's everybody's day going in chat? What you guys up to talk to me?
[18164.28s -> 18169.52s]  I know I stopped like teaching the game and started whining like I got on my main account a few hours ago
[18169.52s -> 18179.27s]  And I stopped teaching and I started whining a bunch. So my bad my bad on that one dudes
[18180.43s -> 18189.52s]  How are you guys doing now? How's everybody's day gone?
[18189.52s -> 18190.92s]  When did the coaching services open?
[18190.92s -> 18196.12s]  Oh, I could probably do coaching at some point soon.
[18196.12s -> 18200.72s]  Like, I'd be willing to do some coaching, some like subcoaching or something, or like,
[18200.72s -> 18211.90s]  something like that. It might be fun.
[18211.90s -> 18213.90s]  Sucking in bronze, you don't get enough time to actually improve.
[18213.90s -> 18217.90s]  Dude, I feel that, man. It takes a long time. League is not an easy game to
[18217.90s -> 18219.90s]  pick up and start playing, right?
[18219.90s -> 18222.60s]  Like, if you're in bronze or silver and you're like, oh, I actually, you know,
[18222.60s -> 18225.20s]  haven't fun playing the game, I kind of want to try and get better.
[18225.20s -> 18228.80s]  It's you're just overwhelmed with so much info that you like have to play so many games
[18229.96s -> 18236.75s]  Right, I feel you man. Like it's it's overwhelming
[18245.36s -> 18257.70s]  Yeah, I I feel you well. We got mid. Okay, uh
[18259.18s -> 18260.58s]  Shall I just play Trist?
[18260.58s -> 18266.48s]  I'm worried if I picked Trist that we won't have AP but I
[18267.00s -> 18270.64s]  Also think I'm better at Trist than I am at like other stuff
[18271.92s -> 18280.55s]  So, I don't know AP Varus
[18280.55s -> 18284.53s]  I'm not good enough an AP barris man. I'm gonna be real
[18285.13s -> 18291.18s]  Well, my mouse is good, but the problem with miles is like miles is a shitty champion
[18291.82s -> 18293.82s]  like miles is trash right so like
[18295.30s -> 18299.84s]  He's good, but he's like not good in the sense of like I can play him well
[18300.52s -> 18303.18s]  but at the end of the day if they pick something that like
[18304.24s -> 18306.24s]  counters mouths I just lose
[18306.56s -> 18310.90s]  Or is like Tristana is just free to pick
[18310.90s -> 18317.90s]  Like even if we play all ad right let's say we do all ad or some shit like on accidents or because people are one tricks
[18317.90s -> 18318.70s]  blah blah blah
[18318.70s -> 18325.98s]  It's it's still free like Tristan is still like a good pick because even with all ad she's still like you can build Lord Dom's
[18326.62s -> 18331.46s]  She has incredibly high pressure early game if you play her right right like you could push the waves Rome
[18332.06s -> 18337.14s]  You can you can roam top room bot help lanes out like level 2 3 you can invade junglers early
[18337.14s -> 18342.73s]  Like she's just incredibly incredibly strong this guy should go pike I
[18343.93s -> 18349.33s]  Was gonna say they picked new new and I picked an 80 mid they picked new new and Thresh
[18350.13s -> 18352.13s]  We should have an engage
[18352.13s -> 18357.61s]  Cuz cuz pike Trist like I can just walk bot on repeat now and pretty much kill people
[18367.74s -> 18371.78s]  Watch an iron game watching an iron game. I feel like it wouldn't be an actual iron game though
[18371.78s -> 18379.03s]  Would it I've heard I had friends who are contentionally lost a bunch of games
[18379.03s -> 18385.95s]  and so they could get to iron four right they like they like into down to iron four
[18385.95s -> 18394.07s]  whatever to see if they could make it and there's just so many like smurfs in iron
[18394.07s -> 18402.23s]  there's like legitimate bot bot accounts like like accounts that are like being
[18402.23s -> 18406.27s]  bodied right there's like bought of the counts and iron there's like smurfs
[18406.27s -> 18420.06s]  all over the place. It seems to have stopped. I wonder if Riot like did something that stopped the bots.
[18421.66s -> 18425.58s]  They must they may have like they may have just incorporated something that like stops the software
[18429.66s -> 18435.66s]  but I don't know. I haven't heard anything about it but I have no clue. I'll be real. I don't know.
[18459.89s -> 18461.89s]  You had to take fall you around last game. I got boots one.
[18463.73s -> 18472.69s]  Dude, that sounds awful. I kind of feel bad for actual iron players who are like
[18474.29s -> 18494.66s]  In iron trying to climb because like that sounds bad. I do think you can climb obviously out of any illo
[18494.66s -> 18498.30s]  It doesn't matter, right? Like if I were to go in an iron game, I'd probably drop like 50 kills
[18498.94s -> 18504.74s]  But I so I do think you can climb out of any, you know, any illo for sure
[18505.06s -> 18523.70s]  You love only new account a few years ago. You had a bot account that answered every time I wrote bot
[18530.58s -> 18539.47s]  That's funny
[18539.47s -> 18541.43s]  Yeah, I assume that's a good point
[18541.43s -> 18546.73s]  I guess if you're in iron you could like play to learn the game a bit better and then you could like play a new account and see
[18546.73s -> 18548.73s]  Where you got yeah, I know that would work
[18549.65s -> 18551.09s]  That makes sense
[18551.09s -> 18560.40s]  Sure. I'll first pick man. I'll first pick Senna. I
[18563.80s -> 18567.74s]  Guarantee they walk in fucking these people are gonna walk in fucking
[18568.42s -> 18570.42s]  Nautilus or some shits
[18570.54s -> 18573.02s]  They'll be like Jarvan Nautilus
[18575.82s -> 18582.78s]  I don't even know
[18582.78s -> 18587.50s]  Riven's not too bad for center. It's okay. They'll get flanked. I actually don't think Riven's too bad right now
[18587.66s -> 18591.30s]  Maybe all the Riven players I played against suck, but I don't think she's actually that bad
[18591.30s -> 18597.72s]  I think Riven's like just you have to position well. I think ribbons really broken at abusing positioning
[18598.34s -> 18606.18s]  That's why she's so good. It's all a queue like good Riven players all get really gross flanks and the flanks are what's OP
[18606.18s -> 18609.14s]  Yeah, there's the Gragas. Okay, I was like they're gonna play something to fuck me over
[18609.14s -> 18616.32s]  over. This guy picked Gragas, but it was going to be like J4 or Gragas or something. And
[18616.32s -> 18622.32s]  then this guy is the support, he'll probably pick Nautilus. Unless he's a one-trick, right?
[18622.32s -> 18626.04s]  Like, unless this guy's straight up just like a one-trick, he'll pick like Nautilus or
[18626.04s -> 18637.18s]  some shits. Maybe Rakan, Rakan or Nautilus. Because if he picks an Enchanter, we just
[18637.18s -> 18651.30s]  win the game. He has to pick Engage. Milio would be really good here too, actually.
[18651.30s -> 18656.66s]  Mirio would counter half our team you can Mirio Q Wukong and Kenan engage
[18658.38s -> 18670.85s]  Like if this guy played Mirio, this would actually be a hard land Tom kinsh. I mean I I get it, but I think it's bad
[18672.71s -> 18674.71s]  Runes oh shit
[18675.15s -> 18678.41s]  Yo, you just saved me looking like an absolute fool
[18679.19s -> 18681.19s]  Thank you
[18681.19s -> 18684.69s]  Holy crap. If you wanted to see my runes, they're here, but thank you. You reminded me.
[18684.69s -> 18687.19s]  Here, I'm gonna be over here. I'm gonna get some water. I'll be right back.
[18687.19s -> 18688.69s]  Get some agua.
[18688.69s -> 18731.15s]  By the way, the people who are here to watch me play AD Carry...
[18732.15s -> 18734.15s]  I sincerely apologize.
[18735.15s -> 18739.15s]  I know watching me play Senna is probably boring as fuck.
[18739.15s -> 18743.00s]  Okay?
[18743.00s -> 18744.00s]  I know.
[18745.00s -> 18750.00s]  And I promise you, we will play AD Carry at some point. I promise you.
[18750.00s -> 18753.12s]  Played like the first four hours of the stream was ad carry or the first three
[18753.48s -> 18757.24s]  Right, I played on my smurf for a few games and played some ad so if you want to watch that you can go back in the
[18757.24s -> 18759.24s]  Bod we did some my commentary and shit
[18761.24s -> 18765.28s]  The only reason I'm playing so much Senna and support on this account is because like
[18766.28s -> 18773.40s]  There the elo I'm currently in is like the worst elo to climb in solo queue because of a lot of factors and
[18774.60s -> 18777.08s]  Support has some of the highest impact on the game
[18777.08s -> 18785.64s]  Whereas like ADK has high impact late, but in solo queue you want to have high impact early and I wanted to be able to
[18786.68s -> 18822.52s]  Impact the game really early on. So yeah, sorry about being you know boring and shit. I just really want to like win games
[18824.08s -> 18825.32s]  At least on this accounts
[18825.32s -> 18830.02s]  I want to get out of the silo because the faster I get out of the silo the faster
[18830.64s -> 18843.60s]  the faster I get out of the silo the faster I can
[18843.60s -> 18847.46s]  Have fun playing ad carry and like trancon
[18849.26s -> 18851.26s]  What a weird
[18851.44s -> 18856.22s]  Like what a weird play by these guys what the fuck they like half shoved the waves
[18856.98s -> 18862.26s]  To get like early bush control and then they do shit like that
[18862.74s -> 18874.05s]  This guy's just done. I'm gonna give it to twitch
[18878.28s -> 18880.04s]  Nice. We got his exhaust
[18880.04s -> 18884.44s]  So I wasted my exhaust there. I did it because I thought the jinx was gonna insta flash
[18884.44s -> 18890.88s]  Like I didn't exhaust because I was like scared of her damage. I did it because I thought she was gonna like
[18891.16s -> 18893.16s]  Try and flash away the second that's
[18894.88s -> 18897.60s]  But I landed my snare it was kind of bad by me
[18897.60s -> 18901.04s]  I mean I landed my snare so I didn't need to exhaust her. I just was like, oh, maybe she'll flash
[18901.72s -> 18903.72s]  She did not she did not flash
[18905.16s -> 18908.40s]  What he was this this 500 LP Masters 400 LP
[18910.28s -> 18912.28s]  Insane, I know
[18912.28s -> 18938.03s]  Absolutely crazy. Put that ward there because Gragas is probably bot, you know?
[18939.75s -> 18948.36s]  So
[18948.36s -> 18955.12s]  They're trying to come up from bot to kill me here like they're bot lanes rotating up to try and kill me
[18956.44s -> 18961.28s]  So just be careful twitch. They're in here, man. I
[18962.64s -> 18964.84s]  Actually have to back and walk look
[18972.48s -> 18976.38s]  This is hilarious the enemy bot lane literally is roaming mid. Look at this
[18977.30s -> 18980.54s]  What?
[18980.54s -> 18981.98s]  Why?
[18981.98s -> 18993.11s]  I'm not trying to soak his XP. I just want those souls. I'm scared to walk in here. I don't know where Gragas is
[18993.11s -> 19008.17s]  I gotta come bot to help my twitch so they don't freeze the wave
[19008.69s -> 19013.57s]  Like I don't want them to be able to freeze here
[19015.70s -> 19018.04s]  Even if Gragas ganks we win we win the fight right now
[19020.17s -> 19024.53s]  Like it's an easy fight win as long as we don't get knocked up. We just win the fight automatically
[19032.34s -> 19035.14s]  Actually, we're trying to bait Gragas to come gank this
[19043.42s -> 19044.78s]  easy
[19044.78s -> 19046.78s]  double flashes baby easy
[19046.78s -> 19051.78s]  Easy.
[19051.78s -> 19065.20s]  You fucking cowards.
[19065.20s -> 19066.76s]  We should back up.
[19066.76s -> 19068.44s]  Like I can go by now.
[19068.44s -> 19070.12s]  Oh, Greg is the top.
[19070.12s -> 19073.80s]  We could actually maybe do dragon.
[19073.80s -> 19074.64s]  Yo, I'm gonna be real.
[19074.64s -> 19077.36s]  A-Soul Roaming is not in the top list of me
[19077.36s -> 19078.64s]  being nervous about it.
[19081.10s -> 19086.50s]  Like I'm not nervous about A-Soul Roaming, man.
[19086.50s -> 19089.06s]  Push this so we can, oh, we're diving them?
[19090.06s -> 19091.06s]  That's a bit scary.
[19091.06s -> 19094.50s]  Welcome to the League of Draven.
[19094.50s -> 19096.50s]  Good to see you're back to enjoying the game
[19096.84s -> 19099.32s]  Whoa, we're going still diving that that's not good
[19100.04s -> 19116.68s]  Like we back off here, man. I mean we can maybe go up here if you really want to I kind of want to ward this I
[19123.26s -> 19125.36s]  Need to reset though really badly right now
[19130.41s -> 19132.41s]  really badly
[19133.17s -> 19135.53s]  Not being on the map here is really bad
[19136.89s -> 19138.89s]  Or rather not like having
[19139.25s -> 19142.25s]  Gold spent and being on the map is what I meant to say like it's really fucking bad
[19143.05s -> 19146.69s]  Yo back up you know Gragas that you watched him walk past three wards
[19148.05s -> 19150.57s]  That's why I just warded no no he's still here
[19151.45s -> 19153.45s]  ragas is right there
[19154.25s -> 19158.13s]  Like we know Gragas is somewhere bot lane right now. I don't know where but we know he's there
[19158.65s -> 19165.87s]  They're on dragon. Okay
[19165.95s -> 19167.95s]  We can fight this go go go
[19168.35s -> 19186.63s]  W over I'm here. Nice. Yo come here
[19188.11s -> 19190.83s]  Y'all help you come get this mother is blue
[19192.35s -> 19228.22s]  I got you, baby. What the fuck made a bitch. Oh, I guess I'll back
[19230.10s -> 19234.52s]  Yo Spartan, thank you for the six months man. Welcome back. Appreciate it
[19235.86s -> 19238.64s]  Yes, we'll back. We'll get our fucking umbral
[19239.98s -> 19241.98s]  I'm gonna go top side of the map now
[19242.62s -> 19244.82s]  And I'm gonna help my team get rift heralds
[19245.58s -> 19248.50s]  I'm gonna ping. I want to go top side. I want to help my team get refs
[19256.00s -> 19262.08s]  The wave if we look at bot wave, it's pushing into us. It's totally fine. Okay, which is level six
[19263.60s -> 19286.59s]  The bot wave is pushing in we are totally fine to do what I'm doing right now. He doesn't know I'm here. I'm dead though
[19293.27s -> 19296.77s]  Ro
[19296.77s -> 19299.01s]  No joke. I almost juked that
[19300.29s -> 19305.45s]  That's so close. I was hoping like wukong for some reason didn't walk topside
[19305.45s -> 19308.75s]  But the enemy bot lane did?
[19308.75s -> 19315.67s]  Okay, the enemy bot lane just griefed their entire game.
[19315.67s -> 19317.43s]  The game's over, we win.
[19317.43s -> 19318.87s]  What the fuck are they doing?
[19318.87s -> 19319.87s]  What is happening?
[19319.87s -> 19324.77s]  Like my twitch is just getting free plates.
[19324.77s -> 19340.18s]  Wait, you guys are griefing.
[19340.18s -> 19341.50s]  I'm griefing.
[19341.50s -> 19345.02s]  Dude, what the fuck?
[19345.02s -> 19347.02s]  Why would you fight them?
[19347.02s -> 19348.02s]  Guys!
[19348.02s -> 19349.02s]  Guys!
[19349.02s -> 19350.02s]  Guys!
[19350.02s -> 19351.02s]  Wukong!
[19351.02s -> 19352.02s]  Wukong!
[19352.02s -> 19356.98s]  We see that our twitch is getting free plate spot free first turret. Okay. I'm back
[19356.98s -> 19363.72s]  I almost soloed their ad carry. Okay, or their jungler. Why would you ever on purpose?
[19364.26s -> 19367.30s]  Take a for a fight like that with no. Oh
[19367.86s -> 19369.86s]  I have cancer I
[19370.30s -> 19371.40s]  Also
[19371.40s -> 19376.14s]  The wukong's an idiot. He doesn't understand macro at all apparently because I literally
[19376.70s -> 19380.12s]  Pings to come to rift my wukong was like nervous
[19380.12s -> 19387.62s]  Like for some reason Wukong didn't walk top, he sat bot trying to gank.
[19387.62s -> 19389.42s]  But the objective was Rift, not...
[19389.42s -> 19394.12s]  God, I'm losing my mind in this elo.
[19394.12s -> 19399.20s]  Masters players are literally just diamond players with slightly better mechanics.
[19399.20s -> 19402.44s]  They don't know anything about the game and I'm about to, my brain's about to explode
[19402.44s -> 19405.26s]  like a peanut.
[19405.26s -> 19409.54s]  It's not about them laning 2v2, you fucking cumquat.
[19409.54s -> 19412.86s]  Dude, I know they can't lane against this 2v2.
[19412.86s -> 19414.82s]  It's not about the 2v2, man.
[19414.82s -> 19419.54s]  We get a free Rift, Harold, because we shut down their bot lane and I'm on an item spike.
[19419.54s -> 19421.94s]  So we just automatically get a free Rift.
[19421.94s -> 19427.03s]  It has nothing to do with 2v2.
[19427.03s -> 19428.63s]  This come-quat motherfucker.
[19428.63s -> 19435.99s]  I don't know why that's my insult.
[19435.99s -> 19438.63s]  The pedestrian guy got to me.
[19438.63s -> 19439.63s]  Somehow.
[19439.63s -> 19449.40s]  Where the fuck is this ward?
[19449.40s -> 19456.12s]  Oh.
[19456.12s -> 19460.48s]  Because I'm telling you right now, my macro there was 100% correct, by the way.
[19460.48s -> 19461.48s]  Like, 1000%.
[19461.48s -> 19475.29s]  like even though I died I know it was correct no no just do dragon do not
[19475.29s -> 19478.89s]  dive guys we don't have to not everything's about kills not everything's
[19478.89s -> 19482.73s]  about kills we got this like you don't need to dive you don't need to dive
[19482.73s -> 19487.13s]  always you don't need to see a kill be like ooh monkey kill brain go like the
[19487.13s -> 19491.93s]  game is about like getting objectives on timers and playing off of tempo and
[19491.93s -> 19495.89s]  things like that like the only reason we even lost rift was because my
[19495.89s -> 19499.93s]  wukong went full monkey brain and was like no we need to not play for
[19499.93s -> 19529.71s]  Rift with a giant massive lead. Wait kill this guy. What am I watching right now?
[19532.03s -> 19537.31s]  This is outrageous. My Wukong just solo ulted there. Dude I'm gonna lose it. My Wukong just solo
[19537.31s -> 19554.36s]  ulted their Gragas. On a good note though, they don't get any plates off of rifting so it's not
[19554.36s -> 19564.21s]  not that bad okay man just push like dude hit the minions like stop my bad sorry
[19564.21s -> 19570.09s]  I'm wound up right now Kenan okay I'm gonna wound apologies if I if I grieve
[19570.09s -> 19579.05s]  to you man so the wound up it's fine I just don't like when like stuff like
[19579.05s -> 19582.57s]  that happens I'm a perfectionist and it's my big place I talk about this
[19582.57s -> 19586.01s]  I'm a perfectionist my biggest flaw is that like I will
[19587.13s -> 19591.45s]  Play the game 100% correctly on like tempo and timers, but you can't do that
[19591.97s -> 19594.81s]  Because you got to remember to like your teammates or teammates
[19598.36s -> 19601.92s]  Like they're not just gonna instantly know exactly what you're what what to do
[19603.04s -> 19616.77s]  We win that guy don't just stand here and watch me die man
[19617.87s -> 19619.87s]  Holy shit
[19623.45s -> 19628.09s]  That is oh my god if he if he had let me die there I might have screamed
[19629.25s -> 19631.73s]  Actually screamed out loud in anger
[19634.93s -> 19638.41s]  Like dude is watching me kite these people within one inch of my life
[19639.41s -> 19642.65s]  And instead of like helping or walking up and doing anything. You know what he does
[19645.13s -> 19647.13s]  He pulls a fucking gross score
[19647.45s -> 19652.27s]  My man just likes to watch
[19652.27s -> 19655.27s]  Something wrong with it, but you know there's a time and a place I
[19671.84s -> 19674.48s]  Don't actually want to buy pinks because I don't think we're strong enough that uh
[19675.12s -> 19679.08s]  I don't think that we're strong enough that I can actually even defend the pinks right now if I'm being honest like
[19679.88s -> 19683.96s]  We should be strong enough, but we kind of throw a lead when I overforced the rift
[19684.52s -> 19686.76s]  so I think I
[19691.44s -> 19701.24s]  Think we need to push this wave so that we can get tempo and move around the map prior
[19702.12s -> 19709.08s]  Sorry, I keep saying the wrong thing. Oh
[19709.92s -> 19712.18s]  That guy's dead. I have to ditch that guy
[19713.24s -> 19715.48s]  He's dead as fuck. Oh, I'm dead too. Maybe I
[19716.32s -> 19718.32s]  I am so dead
[19718.32s -> 19720.22s]  Yeah, that was my bad
[19720.22s -> 19724.84s]  That was my bad my bad my bad like I we just got we just got ran down. That was on me
[19727.70s -> 19731.90s]  Like we we had good positioning, but the jungler wasn't
[19732.54s -> 19740.34s]  Close enough, so this is my bed. I also didn't expect to get fucking four man's but I should have right
[19740.98s -> 19747.53s]  We should play for this though. I wish I could type. I wish I wasn't chat restricted for a year
[19747.53s -> 19754.77s]  Dude, I swear to God, I'm not even being mean, like Riot was like they chat restricted me
[19754.77s -> 19759.57s]  because I type so much macro that it gets on people's nerves and they don't want me spam
[19759.57s -> 19765.21s]  typing.
[19765.21s -> 19766.21s]  Low key.
[19766.21s -> 19779.03s]  Don't play for rifts.
[19779.03s -> 19782.35s]  I need help guys, if you guys can help.
[19782.35s -> 19784.35s]  We need the clear vision on dragon.
[19784.35s -> 19795.11s]  A year?
[19795.11s -> 19802.23s]  Yeah, I get uncharted, April 15th, or April 11th or some shit, uh, 2020.
[19802.23s -> 19812.03s]  I've never seen it it must have been like an actual riot or something like I've never seen an automated system give you a year chat restricts, right?
[19812.43s -> 19814.99s]  so in my mind it's got to be like an actual like
[19817.54s -> 19819.54s]  Like a riot or was like dronimo
[19820.54s -> 19823.26s]  We know you're good enough to climb but stop typing
[19824.66s -> 19834.29s]  You know, I mean that's like what must have been going on and I'm like, okay. Well
[19835.37s -> 19851.88s]  Sure, I
[19851.88s -> 19853.88s]  I mean, I didn't know you could get chat band a year
[19854.52s -> 19859.56s]  What's weird is like I said, I don't like say trigger words. It's not like I tell people to like end themselves and stuff
[19860.00s -> 19865.06s]  It's mainly just me typing like go here do that do this like I type a lot, right?
[19865.28s -> 19869.10s]  Which is obviously like if you type a lot it can be toxic as well. So
[19872.86s -> 19874.78s]  Like typing a lot's annoying so I get it
[19886.25s -> 19889.41s]  We should be playing for baron side vision right now not
[19890.57s -> 19893.41s]  The vision we're playing with right now is bad. We should be playing over here
[19895.13s -> 19899.21s]  Like I want to play for Baron vision, but it's a little hard to do that right now
[19899.85s -> 19907.94s]  Cuz you see how Tom Kenshin me are like transferring vision control around the map right now
[19908.44s -> 19912.08s]  We're playing this little support game of like hide the vision
[19913.44s -> 19915.44s]  Look at this fuck
[19915.44s -> 19918.88s]  Look at this motherfucker!
[19931.06s -> 19933.06s]  Oh, he's so dumb!
[19941.64s -> 19951.87s]  I still think he's dumb.
[19951.87s -> 19953.87s]  How did I just take...
[19953.87s -> 19960.57s]  Did I?
[19960.57s -> 19962.57s]  I took my entire HP bar on a global.
[19962.57s -> 19966.20s]  My bad.
[19966.20s -> 19969.20s]  Dude, I really wish the Malfight would group though.
[19969.20s -> 19973.20s]  I get that he's like doing the thing where he's like, oh, let's, you know, split.
[19973.20s -> 19975.96s]  Like his play was actually really smart there
[19976.56s -> 19980.60s]  The mouthfights play I mean like that wasn't his fault that we got shit on at all
[19980.60s -> 19985.46s]  I just wish they would group because if he groups up and hit the hits are we win every team fight
[19986.28s -> 19991.22s]  Because right now our only frontliner is the wukong, right and the fact that wukong is our frontliner
[19991.22s -> 19993.22s]  We don't have the ability to play the game
[19994.74s -> 19996.74s]  When I get stuck on that what the fuck was that
[19997.98s -> 20002.60s]  Like that Tom kinch getting to e-forward like that blindly into our entire team
[20003.20s -> 20009.60s]  Then not getting punished for it might be the most like solo queue thing I've ever seen nobody wanted to hit him because he was the tank
[20010.20s -> 20012.20s]  but
[20012.40s -> 20014.96s]  Yeah, that's we should still kill him, you know
[20016.00s -> 20024.69s]  We can fight this guy. Oh my god jungler just come. Oh
[20025.61s -> 20028.09s]  We're forfeiting. Okay, that makes perfect sense, right?
[20030.25s -> 20031.89s]  Just come group
[20031.89s -> 20034.49s]  Bro cannon come group. Please guys
[20034.49s -> 20038.81s]  Like I don't know why everybody's frustrated. We're literally still up in gold
[20039.69s -> 20041.89s]  Please come group up. We just took an inhibitor
[20042.81s -> 20044.81s]  Just just come group
[20045.73s -> 20048.79s]  Help me get vision on this dragon so that I don't so we don't die
[20049.53s -> 20052.81s]  Like I need my team to actually walk over here to help me get vision
[20053.49s -> 20059.82s]  It's really frustrating because I need the frontliners the wukong in the mouth fight to walk in with me
[20060.48s -> 20064.44s]  Because I'm a little fucking why I have a big gun, but I'm a big gun girl, right?
[20064.44s -> 20068.90s]  So I need I need these two guys to walk in with me. These two big burly mountain men
[20069.90s -> 20079.74s]  So that I can play the game, you know, no, we don't push bot. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[20079.90s -> 20080.94s]  mid
[20080.94s -> 20082.94s]  No, bot is worthless come in
[20083.34s -> 20085.74s]  My mouth fights pushing the wave that we already have down. I
[20086.42s -> 20088.42s]  Wish I could macro. I
[20088.42s -> 20092.02s]  Wish I could type some macro right now. They're they're like what my team is so lost
[20092.66s -> 20096.88s]  They're so beyond lost right now. It's crazy
[20098.87s -> 20108.66s]  They're lost this shit
[20108.66s -> 20112.26s]  Just do two dragon. Yes, just do this. Just do I'll start it for you. Here you go. I
[20113.02s -> 20117.10s]  Don't know why we're standing in a bush waiting for them to face check you dragon. Guess I
[20122.10s -> 20126.18s]  Swear to God you have to do everything in this elo where you have to start every fight
[20126.18s -> 20128.64s]  I have to basically I have to start every fight
[20129.18s -> 20133.50s]  Right, I have to not only start every fight, but I have to like ping my team what to do exactly
[20134.26s -> 20139.66s]  Because everybody plays so safe in this elo. Why did my mouth fight? Just stop his back
[20139.66s -> 20155.59s]  why are you all fighting oh my god please guys it's fine it's fine fine no
[20155.59s -> 20159.83s]  mouth bite you can't 1v9 that just back off they didn't get anything they
[20159.83s -> 20165.59s]  didn't get anything we got dragon we're on dragon soul points I'm losing hairs
[20165.59s -> 20170.39s]  I'm losing fucking hairs man I ain't got many hairs to spare anymore we're
[20170.39s -> 20179.14s]  out here losing hair it's like I'm babysitting like this has got to be
[20179.14s -> 20183.94s]  what a preschool teacher feels like you know like low-key like preschool teacher
[20183.94s -> 20192.66s]  just feels feels like this this has to be it like watching it's like watching a
[20192.66s -> 20195.66s]  toddler like you watch them from the corner right and they're like eating
[20195.66s -> 20199.86s]  glue and you're like I mean that's bad and then you tell him like don't eat
[20199.86s -> 20203.66s]  glue jet don't eat glue to me and he's like okay and then like you leave him
[20203.66s -> 20206.82s]  there for five minutes to go like do something to watch somebody else then
[20206.82s -> 20212.34s]  all of a sudden Timmy's eating glue again and you're like bro bro we just
[20212.34s -> 20222.83s]  had this discussion and it's like not Timmy's fault right because he's a
[20222.83s -> 20228.31s]  toddler so you can't be mad at Timmy because he's a toddler you can't but
[20228.31s -> 20242.96s]  it's like it's frustrating it's like god damn it man like what is what is
[20242.96s -> 20246.64s]  happening like mouth fight just group my mouth fight has a fetish with just
[20246.64s -> 20255.08s]  pushing bot bro just group and hit R bro I know you have Bork wait you have
[20255.08s -> 20263.10s]  Bork what I bro we need we need to be able to engage we don't win through
[20263.10s -> 20269.50s]  split. Just group up and hit R and we win. I've been controlling the everliving fuck
[20269.50s -> 20273.30s]  out of all the vision in this game. I feel like I'm doing all of this to control vision
[20273.30s -> 20282.13s]  and shit and it still feels like it's not enough. It's kind of nuts. Loki, it still
[20282.13s -> 20292.39s]  feels not enough. No, don't go bot. Don't go bot. Don't go bot. Don't go bot. Please
[20292.39s -> 20315.22s]  don't go bot. Get me! They don't have a ward. They don't know I'm there. Well,
[20315.22s -> 20322.38s]  We're just not going to ult that guy or what?
[20322.38s -> 20326.18s]  This is why we listen.
[20326.18s -> 20331.18s]  Oh my god, I have, I actually just, I'm so, I don't know what to say.
[20331.18s -> 20332.90s]  Like I literally pinged to come.
[20332.90s -> 20334.82s]  Wukong didn't use ulti.
[20334.82s -> 20337.46s]  Twitch just died in, and now he's AFK.
[20337.46s -> 20338.46s]  Oh my god.
[20338.46s -> 20339.98s]  Oh my god, kill me in game.
[20339.98s -> 20340.98s]  Kennen in mouth fight.

[20419.58s -> 20421.58s]  Listen homies you got to push mid first

[20434.49s -> 20441.25s]  That's actually such a good macro call not even joking
[20454.00s -> 20456.00s]  Such a good macro call actually
[20461.38s -> 20463.38s]  Everybody just run though just run

[20472.34s -> 20475.86s]  Dude, I have such high levels of cancer right now. You have no idea
[20475.86s -> 20479.58s]  Like, high, high fucking functioning cancer.
[20479.58s -> 20515.00s]  Did you guys just kill the fucking Gragas?
[20515.00s -> 20518.69s]  Oh my god, thank god.
[20518.69s -> 20521.45s]  Thank god, just end the game.
[20521.45s -> 20522.65s]  Please end the game.
[20522.65s -> 20524.65s]  Please hit the fucking thing.
[20524.65s -> 20527.37s]  Oh my god.
[20527.37s -> 20530.21s]  Walter White is like my hero right now.
[20530.21s -> 20532.33s]  I don't even understand.
[20532.33s -> 20537.25s]  Like I feel like every, like I feel like what Walter White felt like dealing with Skyler
[20537.25s -> 20538.49s]  for literally three years.
[20538.49s -> 20540.71s]  This is outrageous.
[20540.71s -> 20542.31s]  This is what this feels like.
[20542.31s -> 20547.32s]  Like I can relate to the show so much more.
[20547.32s -> 20550.65s]  Oh my God.
[20550.65s -> 20577.06s]  Like dude, oh, oh crap.
[20578.96s -> 20581.24s]  Dude, look at, just look at the like,
[20581.24s -> 20589.56s]  look at like what's going on in the game.
[20589.56s -> 20592.22s]  Like I don't even mean to be mean about this.
[20592.22s -> 20597.07s]  It's just, this is crazy.
[20597.07s -> 20599.29s]  Mouth fight though, popping off.
[20599.29s -> 20610.03s]  Mouth fight popping off.
[20610.03s -> 20613.87s]  Like what are you doing with this guy?
[20613.87s -> 20622.46s]  He's literally diamond. Why is this guy in this game? I mean, I feel I feel like
[20623.18s -> 20627.10s]  Confused now. I'm not even blaming the wukong anymore. I don't know why this guy is in the game. Oh
[20628.86s -> 20637.43s]  He hasn't played it as mmR. Oh, he just has previous season inflated the mmR
[20637.95s -> 20640.87s]  That's what the sense because he was GM for three years
[20641.87s -> 20646.63s]  So the his mmR says that he like belongs here even though he doesn't play like I bet you last season
[20646.63s -> 20653.24s]  He only played like 50 games. I can look right? We just see like how many games he played
[20653.76s -> 20655.76s]  Yeah, he played like 50 games last season.
[20656.64s -> 20658.24s]  So like his MMR didn't really change.
[20658.24s -> 20659.74s]  He just got masters and then stopped.
[20661.14s -> 20662.64s]  Which is fine. There's nothing wrong with that.
[20670.82s -> 20672.32s]  I just wish he would chill, you know?
[20673.96s -> 20677.02s]  Like, not rage quit halfway through the game.
[20679.57s -> 20682.61s]  Because like I said, people's elo and shit used to bother me a lot.
[20682.61s -> 20685.11s]  I don't get bothered by it anymore because I realized it was cringe.
[20685.49s -> 20686.85s]  I don't care about their elo and shit.
[20686.85s -> 20689.61s]  What I care about is like, I just want them to play the game, you know what I mean?
[20689.61s -> 20695.15s]  Like I just want them to not rage not not like be absolute apes in the game and just play that's all I ask for I
[20695.65s -> 20698.99s]  Don't care if you're a diamond player plot player in the game and you're just like accidentally in the game
[20698.99s -> 20701.17s]  It's not your fault. I just want you to push buttons
[20705.35s -> 20707.51s]  What I'm doing wrong to have a 36% win rate
[20707.51s -> 20714.52s]  I can't see the link because just you'd have to give me your name and your server
[20714.98s -> 20721.83s]  How you guys doing by the way everybody having a good day you guys enjoying the stream having a good time
[20722.73s -> 20726.51s]  Watching me go bald in live like live time. You guys are like
[20726.51s -> 20732.11s]  Oh look, Geronimo's going ball of the live on stream and I'm like, yeah, yeah, it's rough.
[20732.11s -> 20770.28s]  Hold on, I'm gonna take my pants off.
[20770.28s -> 20777.93s]  Dude, what, I, I, fuck you guys.
[20777.93s -> 20779.83s]  They fucking, like, I get double swapped.
[20779.83s -> 20780.83s]  Did you guys see that shit?
[20780.83s -> 20782.39s]  They're like, oh, yeah, the support could do it.
[20782.39s -> 20784.87s]  And then he banned Senna.
[20784.87s -> 20787.15s]  I mean, I didn't hover it, so that's my bad.
[20787.15s -> 20789.03s]  God damn it.
[20789.03s -> 20790.03s]  I should have hovered.
[20790.03s -> 20794.22s]  I was just, like, taking my pants off.
[20794.22s -> 20797.86s]  And now he wants first pick.
[20797.86s -> 20798.86s]  Dude, what?
[20798.86s -> 20803.23s]  Oh my god, I don't know what to say.
[20803.23s -> 20804.23s]  This is crazy.
[20804.23s -> 20810.49s]  Today's Thursday, right?
[20810.49s -> 20812.49s]  Am I losing days?
[20812.49s -> 20814.49s]  Today's Thursday, right guys?
[20814.49s -> 20823.52s]  It is?
[20823.52s -> 20824.52s]  Okay, cool.
[20824.52s -> 20826.52s]  What do I play?
[20826.52s -> 20828.52s]  They have Zerath and Xen.
[20828.52s -> 20830.52s]  They have Zaya.
[20830.52s -> 20832.52s]  I guess I can just play Rakan.
[20832.52s -> 20833.52s]  It's not a big deal.
[20833.52s -> 20842.59s]  Let's see what their bot lane is though.
[20842.59s -> 20845.59s]  I actually have to see what their bot lane is to choose my runes.
[20845.59s -> 20850.38s]  So no no oh
[20851.14s -> 20853.14s]  They have an Israel
[20853.22s -> 20855.22s]  The fuck is their team comp?
[20858.17s -> 20889.29s]  Okay, when you do this build, what's the secondary supposed to be? I think it's supposed to be this or maybe like revitalize I
[20890.17s -> 20892.25s]  Just like on flinching so good. Oh
[20894.82s -> 20896.82s]  They have a support
[20897.18s -> 20900.14s]  Zarath so supports out. Yeah. Yeah, okay, so I want I
[20901.10s -> 20903.30s]  Definitely want glacial here and I want
[20903.30s -> 20909.92s]  Maybe I take M.R. actually instead of armor because they have two poke champs and
[20910.80s -> 20920.22s]  I take this. Yeah. Yeah, this is good. Okay. That's not bad. Okay. One sec. I'll be ready. I need to get some more water
[20987.63s -> 20989.63s]  Oh shit no don't flag me
[20991.01s -> 20993.01s]  Fuck man I had to pee
[20993.71s -> 20995.71s]  Fucking flag me for AFK cuz I take a week
[20996.43s -> 21002.18s]  Can you not start with 80 carry to move over to support? I always fall asleep before the 80 carry gameplay
[21003.22s -> 21007.64s]  Wait, what I fell asleep before 80 carry. What do you mean? Oh?
[21009.00s -> 21011.32s]  You mean like start with my main and then play
[21013.90s -> 21028.35s]  Yeah, I played 80 carry at the start I should probably
[21029.47s -> 21031.81s]  Play 80 carry more over support
[21033.63s -> 21057.40s]  later in the stream. Here I'll play an AD carry game after this. I feel bad. Oh it's
[21057.40s -> 21065.57s]  Gragas. I thought it was gonna be Zerath, but it's Gragas. I don't want to fight too hard
[21065.57s -> 21069.97s]  level one even though that guy, I should have gone in there, that was my bad. I want
[21069.97s -> 21076.30s]  to try and get level two here even though I think we actually win level one. Ooh I
[21076.30s -> 21081.02s]  got his bone plating. Yeah I should have fought level one, that was my bad. Because
[21081.02s -> 21085.58s]  we win very hard level one. I just griefed it. Like all I have to do there is
[21085.58s -> 21107.74s]  going on the Ezreal or the Gragas level 1 and they can't play the game. Right? It's
[21107.74s -> 21115.85s]  not worth it's not worth. There's no way that I can not get E'd by Gragas there by the way.
[21115.85s -> 21136.28s]  I don't know if I can flash W there. Maybe we shouldn't be ego-ing buddy. This guy
[21136.28s -> 21154.89s]  just fucking egos in front of me like what? Okay I might have missed everything there
[21154.89s -> 21176.40s]  but like you know it's okay it's a little counterproductive when I take a
[21176.40s -> 21194.56s]  tower shot to land a Q feels a little counterproductive but hey I'm gonna
[21194.56s -> 21202.99s]  back here just in case the enemy Zin tries to gank him in dude I'm so sad
[21202.99s -> 21212.89s]  I can't get boots I'm gonna wait yeah I'm gonna be cringe I'm gonna wait I
[21212.89s -> 21217.49s]  I would never wait here normally, but you know what it's just it's so like it's such a big buy. I
[21219.05s -> 21221.05s]  Don't want to I'm I'm ah
[21221.49s -> 21227.45s]  Now that now that I've waited and beat cringe now. I have to sit here and wait. Oh, it's so painful. Okay. I'm on my way
[21228.45s -> 21247.41s]  I'm sorry guys
[21247.41s -> 21254.06s]  Worth the wait. Nah, not at all. I got lucky, but
[21254.94s -> 21269.75s]  You know what's interesting? I'd never use the stupid dematerializer
[21269.75s -> 21274.61s]  I think I should have like I should use it on every cannon or some shit, but I just don't do it
[21275.17s -> 21278.15s]  Because I know the reason you're supposed to use it is because it helps you push
[21278.83s -> 21281.63s]  Because you can do materialize the cannon right and just instead yeah
[21282.39s -> 21285.75s]  So you're supposed to use it because it's like a really fast way to push but it's also a I
[21302.98s -> 21306.94s]  Should not have W'd fuck. I won't not the Gragas anyway. I
[21307.54s -> 21314.11s]  Fucked up. I shouldn't have W the Gragas. I should play it slower. This guy's gonna die. Oh
[21317.67s -> 21319.67s]  He's gonna die. He put himself against the wall. GG.
[21321.67s -> 21323.67s]  That was my fault though. 100%.
[21324.67s -> 21330.90s]  Cause if I didn't W in, they can't kill us, right?
[21330.90s -> 21332.90s]  And Gragas probably dies to the auto attack anyway.
[21332.90s -> 21336.90s]  My thought process was Gragas snared, so if I W here,
[21336.90s -> 21340.90s]  but even after, like even if I don't get E'd, I'm pretty confident I die.
[21341.90s -> 21379.33s]  Damn it, I tried. I was out of everything.
[21379.33s -> 21388.08s]  I wonder if I could have played that better.
[21388.08s -> 21391.08s]  Maybe like if I could have weaved an extra auto in or something.
[21391.08s -> 21416.62s]  or something. I don't know. It's hard to know. Alright, I'm gonna go mid here. I can't, okay.
[21416.62s -> 21425.26s]  Well, I could go mid, but I think I want to sit bot for a bit and get some XP. I think
[21425.26s -> 21449.06s]  it's smarter to do that at this point. I think we should push this. I don't want to W in
[21449.06s -> 21453.74s]  because I know Zen's area. That's why I didn't want to W because I know Zen's
[21453.74s -> 21473.29s]  here they were just making it so obvious right like that it was like sometimes
[21473.29s -> 21479.21s]  when people make shit too good to be true it is too good to be true like oh
[21479.21s -> 21484.21s]  shit we're just gonna they're just gonna fight us here cool oh yeah I got to
[21484.21s -> 21516.72s]  help him push my bed I'm playing sloppy you guys want to see a cool trick
[21516.72s -> 21523.65s]  Watch this she could push the wave and then just min-max the back
[21525.37s -> 21527.37s]  How cool was that
[21527.37s -> 21534.58s]  She just pushes the wave and I just back next to the bush and she's just like oh, I guess I'll take the free ride. I
[21548.35s -> 21550.35s]  Really need level six badly
[21562.34s -> 21565.92s]  Like bro. I really cannot get level six right now. This is
[21567.38s -> 21573.23s]  Painful
[21573.23s -> 21576.23s]  Hey kill these maybe I'm six off this. Nope. Guess not. I
[21577.19s -> 21580.33s]  Was gonna stay mid there by the way and help the homie
[21581.63s -> 21583.53s]  Need to go mid
[21583.53s -> 21614.43s]  This is so awkward
[21627.83s -> 21635.68s]  Bro help me
[21635.68s -> 21643.14s]  Bro like you got to walk to me like I can't like my Eve is like here. I'm way over here
[21644.44s -> 21647.06s]  Right in my Eve's like yo homie
[21649.61s -> 21655.95s]  Like dude, I'm truck like we're trying to push the wave in for her and she's just not accepting to wait
[21656.71s -> 21660.77s]  And I can't W the wall
[21660.77s -> 21665.65s]  I mean, I guess I could W the wall because I was trying to walk around right I saw her in trouble when I was here
[21665.65s -> 21668.65s]  So I wanted her to walk towards here so I could e over the wall
[21669.45s -> 21672.37s]  That was my thought process e over the wall helped the guy
[21672.65s -> 21676.87s]  But he like didn't understand that and I just got shit on and it felt really bad
[21681.75s -> 21684.11s]  Both our solos are getting absolutely shit on
[21684.71s -> 21688.21s]  This is very bad
[21688.29s -> 21691.69s]  Because I don't know how to help our team at this stage
[21691.69s -> 21699.24s]  Like I'm just always behind on tempo now around the map in the wrong spot at the wrong time
[21700.04s -> 21727.48s]  This is so awkward. I have old we could kill this guy
[21735.92s -> 21756.85s]  You could maybe kill the Zinn if I sneak in here push the wave push the wave hurry
[21758.33s -> 21775.48s]  He's got a crash it
[21775.48s -> 21777.48s]  I mean this guy's just dead
[21777.60s -> 21783.90s]  My 80 carry is gonna get fucked for it though. So I hope it was worth
[21784.82s -> 21786.82s]  Like my 80 carries gonna get zones
[21787.26s -> 21797.24s]  It's really hard to tell if anything like that's worth sometimes because I
[21798.72s -> 21803.38s]  Used my ult before a dragon fight. We're gonna lose bot tower. There's just so many factors, right? It's so far
[21803.92s -> 21806.34s]  And now I don't have words. It's so rough
[21807.16s -> 21828.36s]  I got the ignite off, but dude, I can't believe that Gragas lived
[21829.04s -> 21836.64s]  No, oh, I had stopwatch. I have stopwatch. Oh my god. I'm the worst player in existence. I
[21837.42s -> 21839.82s]  Actually have the ability to live there. Oh
[21839.82s -> 21847.85s]  Oh, no, I should sell my magi's and shame. I
[21849.13s -> 21851.13s]  Actually just want the item so
[21852.65s -> 21854.65s]  Dude, I'm so bad
[21855.37s -> 21859.57s]  Dude, Gragas is low key a good pick versus Rakan though. You can stop his engage so easily
[21868.60s -> 21870.60s]  It's actually low key a good pick
[21896.41s -> 21921.83s]  bro
[21921.83s -> 21935.57s]  Nice not bad. I kind of want to back off here
[21935.57s -> 21942.60s]  You know what feels kind of bad you guys notice that I just I got my I
[21943.40s -> 21945.40s]  Don't know if you guys notice this, but I got my fucking
[21945.92s -> 21952.43s]  I got like four assists just now, but it was after I
[21953.07s -> 21956.81s]  Sold my mages. How fucking bad does that feel?
[21957.99s -> 21959.99s]  Like actually oh
[21964.02s -> 21966.46s]  By the way, uh, I wanted to ask you guys
[21966.46s -> 21973.94s]  What 80 carry do you guys think is the most sought out for people to learn right now?
[21973.94s -> 21981.51s]  Like what would you say is like people want to learn this 80 carry over other 80 carries?
[21981.51s -> 21998.42s]  What do you guys think? My man says Teemo, okay. Makes sense. Got it. Depends. Yeah,
[21998.42s -> 22000.42s]  I'm just trying to wonder like what um
[22002.08s -> 22006.30s]  People would want to watch or what people would want to learn specifically
[22006.38s -> 22009.84s]  So I know everybody plays different shit, but I know there's also like popular shit, you know
[22015.14s -> 22017.14s]  Okay, I'm just bad
[22017.50s -> 22020.22s]  He's bad too. We listen. We're bad
[22023.50s -> 22068.99s]  We're bad guys
[22069.07s -> 22072.09s]  Not bad
[22072.09s -> 22074.09s]  Jin Lucian's IA Felios
[22074.29s -> 22078.01s]  Damn, is it like just that different like a lot of people like different stuff?
[22078.01s -> 22091.78s]  because I've always just thought like oh no I guess I've always just thought that
[22091.78s -> 22098.35s]  people like a lot of people really like like meta AD carries or like really
[22098.35s -> 22102.49s]  playmaking AD carries right like Jinx is probably the best AD carry in the meta
[22102.49s -> 22107.81s]  but I don't see a lot of people ever ask or like request to watch Jinx you know
[22107.81s -> 22110.71s]  what I mean like Jinx is not like she's not like a fun AD carry that
[22110.71s -> 22113.53s]  people want to learn how to play even though she is like the best AD
[22113.53s -> 22117.05s]  there's like the people who are like oh yeah Jinx is boring like I want to
[22117.05s -> 22120.25s]  and like shoot people I want to play like Lucian and dash around like it's
[22120.25s -> 22123.05s]  like so that's what I'm wondering is like what the number one ad carry is for
[22123.05s -> 22142.48s]  like people just like enjoy watching not bad though okay I think we could play an
[22142.48s -> 22150.76s]  ad carry game I'm down I owe you guys an ad carry game I owe you that much for
[22150.76s -> 22153.76s]  watching me play support for two hours actually I think it was like two and a
[22153.76s -> 22161.13s]  half hours yeah we played four games of support so it's like two hours yeah I
[22161.13s -> 22163.13s]  Oh you guys for for that
[22168.96s -> 22174.90s]  Ziya or vain Ziya is fun to watch. I do like Ziya. You love Jinx and Kate. Oh, there you go
[22175.68s -> 22184.17s]  You're playing support top so you like to watch how ad carries play it ah
[22186.37s -> 22189.41s]  So that you can like better help the homies got it got it
[22189.73s -> 22207.56s]  We need eight wins. I think from this point. We are right now. I think it's eight wins to get to Grandmaster I
[22208.52s -> 22213.24s]  Think oops
[22213.24s -> 22217.32s]  Because we're what 370 something right like three set 360
[22219.16s -> 22222.44s]  No, we just won. We're not 360 we're like 370
[22223.92s -> 22228.84s]  We're 387 okay, so it's not updated, but what is this stop?
[22229.28s -> 22236.73s]  So we need what seven wins net wins to get to GM. I
[22237.57s -> 22243.17s]  Think we can hit GM. I'm a little less confident right now about master or about challenger
[22243.37s -> 22245.37s]  But I think we can definitely hit GM
[22246.17s -> 22248.41s]  Like I think I'll get stuck in GM for a bit
[22249.37s -> 22253.46s]  unless
[22253.46s -> 22255.46s]  Unless
[22255.98s -> 22259.52s]  The games get higher quality I'll be stuck in gym for a little bit
[22264.76s -> 22268.08s]  because the thing about the thing about the games so far is like
[22268.52s -> 22273.96s]  The higher quality the games get the easier it actually is to carry if like if you're a decent player
[22274.40s -> 22279.96s]  Because the better your teammates get which means that like if you're at that like say like a challenger player
[22279.96s -> 22284.08s]  We'll have a better time a challenger AD carry player carrying in challenger if they get a lead
[22284.24s -> 22287.64s]  Then in diamond if they get a lead if if that like
[22288.16s -> 22299.16s]  I know that sounds weird to say, but it's basically just because when your teammates are better, they enable you better, and AD carry and all those other roles, when they're being enabled, it's a lot easier to play the game.
[22299.16s -> 22313.02s]  Like if I were to first pick Jynx in Challenger, MMR, there's a good chance my teammates would pick stuff that like lets me play Jynx.
[22313.02s -> 22321.02s]  Right? Not saying it would happen, but there's like a chance that my teammates would pick something that like, they would pick like tanks or frontliners or some shit, right?
[22321.02s -> 22325.62s]  Or like Lulu, whereas like if you're picking Jinx first picking like, let's say you guys
[22325.62s -> 22329.78s]  are gold average, like your support might just literally pick like first time Valkons
[22329.78s -> 22343.99s]  or some shit and you're like, well this sucks.
[22343.99s -> 22348.47s]  Dude I swear every time I hear the end of this song, does anybody know who Forest Within
[22348.47s -> 22350.43s]  is?
[22350.43s -> 22357.43s]  I swear the guy talking at the end of this song sounds exactly like Forest Within.
[22357.43s -> 22358.43s]  No joke.
[22358.43s -> 22367.69s]  Listen to this, listen to this.
[22367.69s -> 22372.37s]  That guy who was like saying it was DJ what I like that guy sounded exactly like I don't know why my brain does that
[22372.41s -> 22380.13s]  Homie sounded exactly like forced within I swear to God. It's actually like perfectly like if you told me that was him
[22380.13s -> 22388.69s]  I would immediately believe you this guy wants to join the discord. Oh
[22390.53s -> 22395.81s]  I'm nervous about this shit. It is my support though
[22395.97s -> 22398.97s]  so like maybe we could join the discord and
[22401.74s -> 22402.68s]  like
[22402.68s -> 22404.68s]  Work together a bit
[22404.68s -> 22422.00s]  But I'm also nervous about joining discord calls with people on stream. Oh, I don't know. I
[22422.58s -> 22424.24s]  Don't know if it's worth
[22424.24s -> 22430.28s]  Where would you put Ezreal on the tier list? I think Ezreal is A tier. I think he could be S tier for solo queue
[22430.56s -> 22433.56s]  But he's hard. He's really hard as well as one of the hardest 80s
[22433.68s -> 22438.00s]  So I would say he's like a tier right now. If you're really good at this
[22438.92s -> 22441.28s]  He is very very very strong
[22442.08s -> 22444.26s]  But he's also incredibly hard to play
[22445.92s -> 22450.72s]  But he also is not weak in the meta, so I'd give him like strong a
[22452.56s -> 22454.56s]  Like above other a's
[22456.36s -> 22460.04s]  She focused on mage supports like brands there earth or engage a puts an autos
[22460.40s -> 22466.24s]  It depends on your elo and it depends on what you're doing. I think engage supports and lower elo are
[22469.04s -> 22477.60s]  Bad. Oh somebody dodged. I think engage supports and lower elo are bad personally
[22478.04s -> 22481.67s]  because I think that a
[22481.99s -> 22490.71s]  You can be a really good engage player and it doesn't matter if your team just gets caught over and over again or if you like make it engage and your team misplays, right?
[22491.15s -> 22499.31s]  So it's like, if you want to play engage supports, do it because they are better than other like engage supports are better than mages.
[22499.51s -> 22502.87s]  But I think in solo queue mages are better to solo carry.
[22503.55s -> 22507.15s]  So it just depends. It depends on your elo and it depends on like what you're trying to accomplish, right?
[22507.91s -> 22511.67s]  Because a lot of the time as a support player, it's why I play Senna, right?
[22511.67s -> 22517.59s]  Like I play Senna because I like being able to carry games as support. That's why I like Senna
[22519.07s -> 22521.07s]  Whereas like if you're a
[22522.03s -> 22526.35s]  Like if I like I can play almost every support right I can play not unless I can play play
[22526.35s -> 22527.35s]  I can play these supports
[22527.35s -> 22532.99s]  But the problem is is like I feel bad if like I get like it feels really shitty to get people ahead and then have
[22532.99s -> 22535.95s]  Them completely throw their leads over and over again and then tilt and range and shit
[22535.99s -> 22537.83s]  So it feels like dog shit
[22537.83s -> 22542.25s]  So it's nicer to just like give myself the opportunity to carry it rather than rely
[22543.23s -> 22548.82s]  100% on other people, you know, but I would say the number one thing is
[22550.18s -> 22552.18s]  Play what you think is fun
[22552.18s -> 22556.36s]  That's just the number one rule like playing if you want to win you can play meta
[22556.66s -> 22561.38s]  But the problem is is if like you're shoving your face into trying to learn a meta champ that you just don't enjoy the play
[22561.38s -> 22566.70s]  Style of you're never gonna actually be good at the at the champion because you're you're like it's like you're working
[22566.70s -> 22571.26s]  Right, but the best way to learn the champions and learn how to play the game is to have fun
[22571.46s -> 22573.62s]  Because you're not having fun at some point
[22573.62s -> 22579.26s]  You're not gonna be able to learn how to play because you're not gonna be able to put in the hours or put in the games and I'd be
[22579.26s -> 22582.94s]  Focused during the game. You're gonna be frustrated and if you're frustrated, you're not gonna be learning
[22583.14s -> 22590.72s]  So I would say just play something that's fun. The fun aspect is gonna be way more important
[22591.12s -> 22611.06s]  Where'd my music go fuck? I'm surprised. Can you guys even hear the music half the time?
[22611.06s -> 22614.16s]  I have it on so low that I'm not even sure you guys can hear it
[22615.36s -> 22617.36s]  It's just like bear me background noise
[22639.44s -> 22642.48s]  Is this guy holding swap hostage?
[22644.40s -> 22646.96s]  Join call and I'll swap
[22653.55s -> 22656.11s]  Dude, he's holding swap hostage
[22666.74s -> 22671.62s]  By the way, if you guys do like the stream, don't forget to follow you can scroll down to see all my socials too
[22672.34s -> 22674.98s]  Like tiktok instagram all that crap
[22675.86s -> 22678.02s]  It's all below the stream. There's like links and shit
[22686.72s -> 22688.72s]  and uh, you know
[22688.72s -> 22705.42s]  A man's gotta eat you can use your twitch prime too if you want you know you're feeling it. I'm gonna do a kaisa game
[22705.86s -> 22709.56s]  he went luxe
[22709.88s -> 22719.13s]  But I kind of want to play kaisa. What was the voice? This is what happens when I get close to the mic I
[22722.49s -> 22728.19s]  Should put the mic in front of my face more the mic's like over to the corner so the mic is like really badly directions
[22728.19s -> 22754.10s]  Is this a cut-down game?
[22754.10s -> 22758.37s]  Gragas always use AP.
[22758.37s -> 22760.87s]  He doesn't go tank, he goes like AP.
[22760.87s -> 22780.08s]  I kinda wanna go last stands.
[22780.08s -> 22781.08s]  That's fun.
[22781.08s -> 22782.58s]  I should have taken Ghost.
[22782.58s -> 22789.05s]  Ghost would have been so good this game.
[22789.05s -> 22790.05s]  Treadcate with Shieldbow.
[22790.05s -> 22791.05s]  That's strong?
[22791.05s -> 22794.14s]  Yeah, it's fun, huh?
[22794.14s -> 22795.14s]  I love K. with Shieldbow.
[22795.14s -> 22796.14s]  It's so fun.
[22796.14s -> 22799.10s]  This would have been such a good ghost game.
[22799.10s -> 22800.74s]  I'm frustrated.
[22800.74s -> 22802.24s]  Oh, well.
[22802.24s -> 22819.50s]  I like wasn't paying attention. I I always wonder if I should go part of me always wants to go like
[22821.34s -> 22825.48s]  Long sort of three against Thresh and Zaya, but with Kaisa
[22825.48s -> 22829.92s]  I feel like you're on really specific timers with Kaisa. So you have to go like
[22830.60s -> 22832.60s]  It's really important to go
[22832.92s -> 22838.40s]  Doran so they can get the Q upgrade timer on the right, you know like on the right timing I
[22839.60s -> 22841.84s]  Think getting the Q upgrade timers just so big
[22842.64s -> 22849.64s]  Also this game, I feel like I go Bork this game. Seconds. Bork or What's Ends.
[22849.64s -> 22855.64s]  If Gragas is not Ultra Fed, I'll probably go Bork, because I don't want to get What's End just for Gragas.
[22855.64s -> 22886.24s]  Okay, he started Q. Oh, Diana's starting on Wolves. Okay. I need to get some coffee after this game. We're getting drowsy.
[22886.24s -> 22908.22s]  I should have done the middle minion thing. I'm so bad.
[22908.22s -> 22916.86s]  I should have legitimately just done the thing with the minion.
[22916.86s -> 22920.36s]  So, when you know Thresh starts hook, you can still play up, right?
[22920.36s -> 22922.06s]  I can play up, I can play aggressive.
[22939.99s -> 22940.99s]  I'm bad.
[22941.99s -> 22944.49s]  I should have just killed the Thresh.
[22945.29s -> 22947.99s]  This is really bad, man. We can't help. We can't help.
[22950.24s -> 22953.94s]  Because the wave, the way the wave's going, oh, I'm so bad. I fucked up.
[22955.87s -> 22960.57s]  It should be fine, but I still, like, we're- it- it fucks us over early game.
[22962.70s -> 22965.20s]  Because they fucked up very badly.
[22965.96s -> 22969.60s]  Like I can't stress enough how badly they just fucked up, but it didn't matter
[22971.22s -> 22972.46s]  Okay
[22972.46s -> 22974.46s]  That's that's happening apparently
[22975.54s -> 22978.36s]  Don't worry guys. I'm the best Ziya player or kaisa player on the server
[22979.00s -> 22991.08s]  It's me. Oh god. I am just literally playing like dog shits
[23006.26s -> 23008.94s]  Why pick kaisa? I just felt like playing her
[23009.42s -> 23016.67s]  We got a back. We have to leave the wave in a bad spot
[23017.55s -> 23031.26s]  Maybe she can push it, but like wukong seriously. Yeah, we just okay. We got it nice. Not bad
[23032.22s -> 23035.52s]  So we had to push the wave in there so that the wave will bounce back
[23035.82s -> 23038.00s]  But we had to do it on it was a really bad timer
[23038.38s -> 23042.48s]  Let me just say I fucked up the entire early game of this game like this games. I'm so bad
[23043.70s -> 23048.42s]  Essentially what should have happened was level one when they walked up when kaisen thresh walked up level one
[23048.66s -> 23051.02s]  We should have killed them like I should have just straight up
[23051.42s -> 23056.86s]  Hit the thresh with the locks because thresh walked into our wave because wukong was level two ganking
[23056.86s -> 23060.94s]  She just killed him. I grieved that and because I went for the Zyah instead
[23060.94s -> 23063.98s]  I put myself in a spot where I took like 80% of my HP for free
[23064.42s -> 23069.54s]  Right which put me behind and now the entire fight was like harder because I was low
[23069.54s -> 23072.70s]  And then we had to wait for the way it was just it was really bad
[23074.26s -> 23075.42s]  Really
[23075.42s -> 23085.95s]  That minion actually just did that. I don't think we can kill this guy unless she can max range land a queue or something
[23085.95s -> 23097.48s]  But yeah, is Zeria the best lady right now? No, I think Jinx is better. I think Zeria is good
[23098.06s -> 23101.40s]  Her way came especially with like paired with an enchanter Zeria is insane
[23102.12s -> 23104.80s]  But I think Jinx is better for solo queue
[23106.68s -> 23116.30s]  I actually have to flash that was a good play hook by that guy. I disrespected him
[23119.16s -> 23127.60s]  I might have to leave because Wukong can just go here and dive me. I actually just have to leave this feels so bad
[23127.60s -> 23131.08s]  You see how Wukong just used the plants?
[23131.08s -> 23134.16s]  If I stay, I can just die, right?
[23134.16s -> 23136.52s]  So I'm just misplaying all over the place.
[23136.52s -> 23138.00s]  I'm taking too much damage.
[23138.00s -> 23140.16s]  We're playing weak side right now, right?
[23140.16s -> 23144.40s]  What I mean by that is like we know our Diana's top and we know their Wukong's bot.
[23144.40s -> 23148.08s]  So because of that, I need to play a lot less trady.
[23148.08s -> 23151.52s]  Like I walked up and just let the Thresh fly me for free and I missed two waves now.
[23151.52s -> 23154.84s]  I need to not do that because if I don't miss these waves, it doesn't matter for
[23154.84s -> 23156.24s]  weak siding because I'm not behind.
[23156.24s -> 23163.26s]  So it's just really stupid.
[23163.26s -> 23166.42s]  Now what I do want to do is I want to go check and see if the Wukong is like on our camps
[23166.42s -> 23174.44s]  or something, or if he's doing dragon or some shits.
[23174.44s -> 23175.88s]  I should not have used the blast cone.
[23175.88s -> 23178.64s]  Dude I am so bad.
[23178.64s -> 23181.12s]  I used the blast cone to just hit it.
[23181.12s -> 23182.20s]  It's playing support man.
[23182.20s -> 23185.00s]  It makes your brain smaller.
[23185.00s -> 23186.00s]  Actually.
[23186.00s -> 23203.14s]  Like I swear playing support makes my brain smaller.
[23203.14s -> 23233.06s]  Oh they're on dragon.
[23233.06s -> 23234.06s]  Xayah's trolling.
[23234.06s -> 23235.06s]  I think.
[23235.06s -> 23239.95s]  I'm pretty sure I just freeze this, no?
[23239.95s -> 23245.59s]  With the Lux?
[23245.59s -> 23246.59s]  Yeah, she's just trolling.
[23246.59s -> 23248.09s]  I don't know what the fuck that was.
[23248.09s -> 23276.37s]  I took a little bit of damage, but she has to overextend now.
[23276.37s -> 23277.37s]  Not bad.
[23277.37s -> 23279.41s]  Okay, so, Xayah wanted to back.
[23279.41s -> 23282.21s]  The reason that I froze that was because Xayah wants to back, but she can't back
[23282.21s -> 23284.45s]  until we push the wave in.
[23284.45s -> 23285.89s]  Or until they push the wave in, right?
[23285.89s -> 23290.73s]  So, it gives me time to kind of catch up on my back timer with Xayah, because
[23290.73s -> 23292.73s]  I'm you know a little bit behind and farm
[23301.51s -> 23303.51s]  Thresh is definitely gonna go mid here
[23304.15s -> 23307.15s]  He's either gonna go mid or he's gonna try and hook us from the bush I
[23308.83s -> 23312.99s]  Think I'm gonna shoot my W through all the bushes here. Okay Thresh isn't in the bushes
[23314.75s -> 23316.75s]  He's just Mia. Yeah, we don't know where he is
[23317.35s -> 23323.79s]  This is awkward because I can't really walk up. I mean, I guess I'm almost sick. So I guess I could walk up
[23325.39s -> 23333.92s]  Yeah, there he is okay, we see him he is level five so it's
[23334.84s -> 23338.64s]  We could probably actually fight, like if this guy lands a binding, I might be able to just trade.
[23345.58s -> 23347.08s]  I just, I am, I'm dead.
[23350.55s -> 23353.05s]  I suck. Honestly, I, I needed to, my bad.
[23355.95s -> 23356.75s]  I'm playing bad.
[23357.35s -> 23358.05s]  That's on me.
[23359.65s -> 23362.25s]  Bilox is playing so good. I needed to, uh,
[23362.75s -> 23366.55s]  W, but then back up after the bind. I've just, I'm mechanically
[23366.95s -> 23369.75s]  shitting on myself right now, like out of my mouth, just shit.
[23373.07s -> 23376.97s]  Cause I knew exactly what was gonna happen when I used W in front of the fucking Thresh's face. I was like,
[23377.67s -> 23378.87s]  Here we go, you know what I mean?
[23379.37s -> 23383.09s]  technically we're both six and he's five but it doesn't matter because if I get
[23383.09s -> 23395.87s]  hooked I don't have enough damage so now here I'm gonna walk up and see if I can
[23395.87s -> 23402.17s]  stop the Ziya's back maybe maybe she's backing in a weird spot yeah we stop
[23402.17s -> 23409.21s]  their backs huge okay now they're in trouble so they really needed the back
[23409.21s -> 23414.25s]  on that timer because they just want to fight right and because they just
[23414.25s -> 23424.86s]  want to fight they want to go back right no way dude fuck off I cannot dodge a hook
[23424.86s -> 23433.91s]  right now to save my fucking life Jesus Christ what is my movement man like
[23433.91s -> 23448.17s]  tilting myself right now I want to stay for this wave but mid is Mia yeah I
[23448.17s -> 23456.05s]  can't it feels so bad because I needed one more wave to get double pickaxe so I
[23456.05s -> 23461.25s]  get my upgrade because like normally you go noon quiver pickaxe pickaxe and if you go noon pick pick
[23461.97s -> 23465.41s]  it gives you enough ad to get your q upgrade right and that's like the whole point you don't
[23465.41s -> 23470.37s]  need kraken you just need your q upgrade because your q upgrades when you start bursting but because
[23470.37s -> 23474.21s]  i got hooked under the turrets even though we got a kill i had to back and i couldn't get my timer
[23477.57s -> 23490.48s]  i'm so trash i need some coffee that's one of those men i swear to god coffee is my savior
[23490.48s -> 23516.58s]  It'll save me
[23520.44s -> 23523.10s]  That wave actually just did that to me holy shits
[23524.38s -> 23526.64s]  We don't actually have to do anything here crazy
[23538.84s -> 23547.65s]  Nice well played
[23558.33s -> 23560.33s]  Nice nice nice
[23560.97s -> 23574.26s]  That was good to be to I already got my Q upgrade now. We're chilling. Oh now. We're how much Ellen. Oh
[23575.62s -> 23577.38s]  Yeah, baby
[23577.38s -> 23583.51s]  You know what it is. It's like a
[23584.39s -> 23586.39s]  I'm playing the fights too quick
[23591.52s -> 23607.59s]  I just got to slow down and like think I'm like too hyped up. I really don't want to miss this wave
[23607.59s -> 23609.59s]  There's a person right there. Oh
[23610.63s -> 23612.63s]  Shit, let's go
[23612.75s -> 23615.91s]  Yeah, he's dead. I'm gonna go farm bot. Well that guy gets that
[23616.67s -> 23622.41s]  This locks is really good. I
[23632.16s -> 23634.12s]  Kind of want to oh, I can't get this plate fuck
[23636.36s -> 23637.68s]  What?
[23637.68s -> 23639.16s]  What?
[23639.16s -> 23641.16s]  That was BS
[23645.22s -> 23649.62s]  Okay, you know what I'll just take my entire HP bar really quick on the turret. It's not a big deal guys
[23650.74s -> 23654.26s]  I'm just I'm that good at the game like I don't mean to brag but like you know
[23654.98s -> 23656.98s]  professional gamer over here like you know
[23657.58s -> 23661.08s]  I'm gonna be the one some lessons like I got you
[23661.96s -> 23672.64s]  Dude look how big my shield is
[23673.52s -> 23688.48s]  wait
[23688.68s -> 23690.68s]  You son of a bitch I
[23691.76s -> 23708.63s]  Mean she's dead, but I got outplayed man
[23713.03s -> 23728.00s]  Motherfucker all right they forfeit it nice
[23728.00s -> 23730.00s]  Oh
[23731.20s -> 23736.19s]  Well, I need to make some coffee I'm playing give me a sec
[23737.13s -> 23739.13s]  We're playing real bad. I need some coffee
[23753.39s -> 23759.79s]  Nice though. We hit 400 LP. Let's go. So now we just need 150 more. We need 550. I think 550 is Jim
[23759.79s -> 23775.15s]  I didn't do anything that game by the way. I did nothing I
[23776.55s -> 23781.43s]  Could play another ad carry game. That was fun. I'm gonna grab some coffee. I'll be right back
[23781.43s -> 23785.79s]  Talks amongst yourselves boys. I believe in you
[23786.87s -> 23790.39s]  You can look at my ad carry tier list that we've been trying to figure out how to do
[23791.23s -> 23793.99s]  Enjoy. I'll be a wee grab some coffee. Oh
[23795.63s -> 23896.02s]  Fucking a
[23896.02s -> 23898.02s]  Alright, I'm back
[23898.86s -> 23902.30s]  Let's go. Oh, fuck
[23903.70s -> 23905.70s]  Sweet
[23906.02s -> 23911.84s]  Be back boys we back
[23911.84s -> 23925.21s]  Time is at five. Oh, I probably play for like another hour and then I got to get off and make some dinner
[23927.05s -> 23929.77s]  Do some other shit, you know, I'm saying
[23930.33s -> 23943.50s]  Where were we? Oh, yeah, we're making the tier list. Yeah, I think Varus is really good a I
[23944.72s -> 23946.72s]  Think versus good a tier cuz um
[23947.92s -> 23949.24s]  In my opinion
[23949.24s -> 23953.04s]  Varus is never really like a bad pick almost like sometimes he's bad
[23953.04s -> 23957.84s]  But I think he's just you can play him on hit or you can play him without he right?
[23957.84s -> 23960.32s]  So he's got two builds that you can do based on the game in the team comp
[23960.60s -> 23962.60s]  His ulti is pretty much always useful
[23963.52s -> 23970.16s]  Like just having a stun like a root on a champion is always gonna be useful right then you have he's got very long range
[23970.20s -> 23972.98s]  Like engage you can safely kill people with his ult in this queue
[23973.56s -> 23979.06s]  You can build him poke where like before objectives you can make picks really easily you can poke people out before the objective get
[23979.06s -> 23983.18s]  low his lane phase is really good if you're if you understand like how to play
[23983.18s -> 23989.74s]  Varus his lane phase is exceptional he also has in the meta currently I feel
[23989.74s -> 23993.02s]  like he's just like a good pick I don't think he's as good as Draven and Jinx
[23993.02s -> 23997.94s]  for solo queue but I do think he's really good in general you can you can
[23997.94s -> 24004.26s]  climb with them really easily and then I put Ashe here too maybe Ashe I don't
[24004.26s -> 24008.58s]  I don't know who I'd put in front, Ash or Varys.
[24008.58s -> 24010.66s]  I feel like maybe Ash or maybe Varys.
[24010.66s -> 24012.02s]  I think Ash is really underrated though.
[24012.02s -> 24026.18s]  I think Ash is super, super good right now.
[24026.18s -> 24029.82s]  I think Ash is super good because,
[24029.82s -> 24031.42s]  sorry I'm trying to think.
[24032.66s -> 24034.66s]  She's basically the same idea as Varys.
[24034.66s -> 24036.86s]  She's a little different, but she's the same idea.
[24038.66s -> 24040.30s]  She controls lane phase pretty well.
[24040.30s -> 24042.14s]  Rarely her lane isn't too bad.
[24042.14s -> 24047.22s]  She also has, like her R, always useful no matter what.
[24047.22s -> 24052.14s]  So you always have use with Ashe, you always have use with Varus R, like they just stuns,
[24052.14s -> 24053.14s]  snares, etc.
[24053.14s -> 24054.14s]  So I'll look here.
[24054.14s -> 24057.54s]  She's also really good at being annoying in teamfights, like you can take Ghost on Ashe
[24057.54s -> 24062.66s]  and you can just Voli, sit outside their range and if you just basically solo people.
[24062.66s -> 24066.78s]  And she actually has decent scaling on her crit now, so you can go a bunch of builds
[24066.78s -> 24067.78s]  too.
[24067.78s -> 24070.94s]  Like I think you can go Bork Ashe, you can go Kraken Slayer Ashe into Bork, or
[24070.94s -> 24076.18s]  Or you can go Kraken Slayer into IE or you can go Kraken Slayer into like whatever.
[24076.18s -> 24078.60s]  You can go Shieldbow Ash if they have tanks, you can go Galeforce that.
[24078.60s -> 24082.06s]  Or you can just do a lot of different builds on Ash and I think she's really versatile.
[24082.06s -> 24084.94s]  You can also just go the Onhit build if you really want.
[24084.94s -> 24086.78s]  I think the Rageblade build sucks personally.
[24086.78s -> 24090.18s]  I think that if I was going to go Onhit I would just be like Shieldbow Whittened
[24090.18s -> 24094.30s]  into like Bork or some shit if I was actually going to do that or Shieldbow
[24094.30s -> 24096.34s]  Bork or Bork Whitz or whatever.
[24096.34s -> 24101.07s]  But yeah.
[24101.07s -> 24103.87s]  I don't know Ezreal is probably A tier 2
[24105.15s -> 24107.55s]  I said Ezreal is relegated by like skill
[24108.11s -> 24109.95s]  So I don't want to put him in
[24109.95s -> 24112.99s]  I think if you could play Ezreal perfectly, he'd be at the top of S
[24112.99s -> 24114.99s]  Like he would just be above Jinx
[24115.55s -> 24119.31s]  Just best champion of the game if you could if you could never miss a skill shot
[24119.31s -> 24122.11s]  Like 100 accuracy playing perfect like the champs insane, right?
[24122.83s -> 24125.47s]  It's absolutely crazy how good that champ is if you could play him perfect
[24125.47s -> 24127.79s]  But you're like people are humans etc
[24127.79s -> 24131.93s]  So I think he's like an A tier pick in solo queue because you can get countered
[24131.93s -> 24134.51s]  Like he's not blindable you can get countered pretty easily by good players
[24135.15s -> 24139.21s]  People play like push comps people play dive comps like early game
[24139.21s -> 24142.69s]  I mean in lane and shits like because Ezreal's lane is like not it's not bad
[24142.89s -> 24146.37s]  But it's very difficult to play as real well in lane fate
[24146.37s -> 24152.05s]  You got to be good mechanically and I don't think even like I've seen like challenger players who can't play as real so
[24153.09s -> 24155.09s]  He's not easy
[24155.09s -> 24169.28s]  You know what I'm saying?
[24169.28s -> 24177.93s]  What's up boys?
[24177.93s -> 24197.40s]  So, I was gonna be in Kindred, but I couldn't find her.
[24198.92s -> 24205.00s]  I hate Kindred.
[24205.00s -> 24206.48s]  Yo, how we doing tonight?
[24206.48s -> 24226.66s]  How's everybody's day?
[24226.66s -> 24247.14s]  Okay, so this guy's picking Thresh again.
[24247.14s -> 24248.34s]  Thresh into Recon.
[24248.34s -> 24260.52s]  Thresh is actually pretty good in the Recon.
[24260.52s -> 24281.08s]  They have Zyra Thresh again.
[24281.08s -> 24284.76s]  Let's play Jinx.
[24284.76s -> 24285.96s]  I like Jinx here.
[24287.16s -> 24288.76s]  Even though it is against Thresh,
[24288.76s -> 24290.16s]  Jinx is a little scary, right?
[24290.16s -> 24292.56s]  But I kinda like her in this situation.
[24292.56s -> 24304.44s]  See what runs do I want free boots? No, I think I want I want to be able to get early boots this game
[24304.96s -> 24309.23s]  Because their team comp is like oh
[24310.11s -> 24313.45s]  Yeah, their team comp is really really annoying. So I kind of want to get
[24315.43s -> 24317.43s]  Early boots
[24317.43s -> 24319.43s]  I'll probably go
[24319.57s -> 24321.49s]  present some minds
[24321.49s -> 24328.32s]  Although I think over hill isn't bad. Actually, I'll go over hill
[24329.64s -> 24333.48s]  So yeah, let's these runes look good. Actually, let's do this
[24335.00s -> 24336.84s]  Or this
[24336.84s -> 24347.41s]  This yeah, this is good. Okay. I kind of like these. This is good. I'm gonna use these okay
[24347.85s -> 24349.85s]  I'm taking clients this game because
[24350.33s -> 24354.57s]  They have La Sondra and Pantheon and Thresh right so with La Sondra Pantheon and Thresh
[24356.41s -> 24360.69s]  The game's gonna be like really fast of like okay if they stun me
[24360.69s -> 24364.33s]  I'm just gonna get CC chained and I'm just gonna die like after a bit right
[24364.69s -> 24367.65s]  It's gonna be like a stun and they're still on and they're still on and I'm just gonna die
[24367.65s -> 24401.68s]  So I'm like nah fuck that shit. Let's see if we can get this W boys
[24402.40s -> 24417.55s]  Let's see if I can not fuck up the first three levels the lane got chat restricted. Oh, yeah
[24418.43s -> 24419.95s]  It's for a while
[24419.95s -> 24448.69s]  It's right secret code to make it so I could actually play the game and climb without chatting. Okay. I
[24449.45s -> 24451.45s]  Should have warded this bush
[24453.49s -> 24457.33s]  I was drinking my coffee I didn't think about it, but yeah, if you guys are against the hook champ
[24457.33s -> 24459.33s]  Always ward this bush
[24459.97s -> 24464.95s]  Right like right here. You're gonna want to
[24465.83s -> 24468.03s]  Ward here early against the most hook champions
[24469.15s -> 24471.41s]  Because it gives you a very nice
[24472.01s -> 24475.45s]  Like they can't walk in here and cheese you they can't walk in here and cheese you
[24475.91s -> 24511.36s]  So you just don't get cheesed by anything. I mean that's just I don't even know what I just saw
[24512.68s -> 24515.28s]  I'll be real. I don't know what the fuck just happened, but okay
[24516.48s -> 24518.48s]  Trying to push this wave as fast as I can
[24518.48s -> 24534.14s]  I'm not sure I can actually get it pushed fast enough, but we're gonna try. It was close
[24539.44s -> 24542.84s]  No, I'm gonna let it just push. It's not a huge deal
[24543.68s -> 24545.68s]  It was very close though
[24545.90s -> 24553.36s]  We can just break the freeze right like it's not a huge deal. Are they supposed to win level one?
[24554.06s -> 24557.94s]  It depends. I mean Ziya's not that good level one like
[24558.34s -> 24560.90s]  She Ziya's good because she has her feathers, right?
[24560.90s -> 24566.86s]  But if you can't stack your feathers level one Jinx has more damage and they stacked up for my gap or for my
[24566.86s -> 24571.18s]  rockets so I got like I full-stacked my lethal tempo and I just double AoE
[24571.18s -> 24578.32s]  rocketed them over and over and over and over again right and so when they
[24578.32s -> 24584.28s]  finally all in they were just behind an HP also Thresh missed he only had Flay
[24584.28s -> 24631.60s]  damn that was so close man like actually if Thresh had died there or
[24631.60s -> 24649.63s]  not Thresh it Graves had died there we just win the game yeah this isn't good
[24649.63s -> 24651.63s]  Oh, I'm gonna get flight. I'm dead
[24652.27s -> 24655.19s]  Maybe oh, maybe I'm not dead. I have to walk up like this
[24656.95s -> 24660.35s]  It was a really bad fight by the what what am I watching what the fuck?
[24661.99s -> 24663.99s]  That was just a bad fight because
[24665.47s -> 24669.45s]  We knew graves was bought and we knew that he was gonna kill in the jungle, right?
[24670.15s -> 24676.63s]  So like my jungler already got outplayed by graves once topside you shouldn't ever take another fight like that
[24676.63s -> 24682.31s]  bot side. You should just take the win, right? Like, I rotated. Now, granted, the Rakan should
[24682.31s -> 24687.47s]  have been there to help kill the Graves. Like, when I rotated, Rakan was still jacking off
[24687.47s -> 24692.31s]  in lane, right? Like, when I was here, Rakan was like way down here. So the support should
[24692.31s -> 24697.19s]  have rotated first, right? Like, I rotated, but the support should have been the one
[24697.19s -> 24700.75s]  rotating. But again, he's just a lot of the time you have support players who don't
[24700.75s -> 24704.95s]  understand timers and how to help. Nobody plays for jungle. Support players hate
[24704.95s -> 24711.95s]  playing for jungle in low elo so it's just not a thing so I tried to go over and help
[24711.95s -> 24719.19s]  him but I misplaced my traps a little bit and then the grave said a flash but he got
[24719.19s -> 24726.19s]  away and they tried to go in again when I was too low to actually help we just got
[24726.19s -> 24733.97s]  lucky we didn't lose the game off that shit kind of does suck those I was really strong
[24733.97s -> 24753.05s]  No, not bad. I should have. Oh, I should have I could have killed her I
[24754.37s -> 24759.44s]  Supposedly I could have killed the guy no joke. I totally could have killed him
[24760.64s -> 24764.52s]  If I had warded the lantern as he tried to take it I would have killed the Zaya
[24766.68s -> 24782.30s]  Because she ego'd the lantern there. She ego'd the lantern so hard if I had if I had warded it. She dies there
[24783.56s -> 24797.12s]  It's my bad this game is really interesting because
[24797.12s -> 24800.80s]  The enemy bot lane is actually misplaying a lot
[24801.68s -> 24806.20s]  Like they're they're really really really misplaying these fights and trades and shit, but uh
[24807.16s -> 24809.16s]  We can't abuse it
[24810.36s -> 24812.80s]  Because the graves has so much control of the game right now
[24813.28s -> 24818.46s]  That we have to basically play safe permanently at the moments, and I can't do anything to help my team
[24818.64s -> 24820.64s]  It feels really bad
[24827.16s -> 24839.20s]  My guys game. Yeah, everyone see little graves with bot again, man. This is so rough
[24839.20s -> 24866.84s]  Graves is men. I want to kill this as fast as I can. We can fight these guys to be
[24866.84s -> 24883.54s]  two actually. Wait why didn't he just go in? I don't know why he didn't just W
[24883.54s -> 24888.70s]  immediately. Like the Recon waited. Oh that tilts me. Like when she was against
[24888.70s -> 24896.50s]  the wall here he should have immediately W'd her because if he W's
[24896.50s -> 24900.66s]  from vision there right and she's against the wall it helps us so much
[24900.66s -> 24908.50s]  Because then I can I can overlay my flame chomps on top of the I can overlay my flame chomps directly on top of the Zaya
[24909.18s -> 24915.84s]  Right as the fights happening rather than like having to work around the fight because thresh is in my face type shit
[24915.84s -> 24923.74s]  You know so we're just we're honestly just losing because we're not pulling the trigger fast enough and
[24925.88s -> 24928.40s]  We can't play aggressive when we can pull the trigger
[24930.48s -> 24933.56s]  Right like we're losing because we can't pull the trigger fast enough and when we can't pull the trigger
[24933.56s -> 24935.56s]  It's the wrong time
[24935.84s -> 24951.33s]  We do this right now. We get dragon. The bot lane back, we get dragon here. I want to go...
[24951.33s -> 24959.86s]  I actually want to go... Wait, the enemy bot lane didn't back. Okay, they're trolling.
[24959.86s -> 24967.84s]  They lost an objective for free here. This is really good. So the enemy bot lane, we fight this by the way.
[24967.84s -> 24985.02s]  We can just straight up fight. That right there is how you lantern. How you've worn a lantern by the way.
[24985.02s -> 24993.70s]  Oh, I did that guy so dirty. Oh, I'm bad. Bye guys. I
[25000.95s -> 25003.19s]  Didn't know Pantheon was Mia. That was my bad. I
[25004.43s -> 25007.11s]  Was like going I was too happy with warding the Lantern
[25007.79s -> 25024.03s]  My bad. I can't believe the enemy team greeted that hard though for gold. Oh, that's actually nuts to me
[25024.83s -> 25034.52s]  No, yeah, the the Ziyas egoing like crazy
[25036.04s -> 25041.52s]  The problem is I can't abuse it constantly because like obviously like I need teammates, right?
[25041.84s -> 25052.47s]  but I can kind of abuse it like but it's much harder by yourself because as you
[25052.47s -> 25056.95s]  can see like I'm not playing poorly but we're getting like we're getting shit
[25056.95s -> 25081.45s]  on shit on's a bad word we're getting like oh come on man they misplayed
[25081.45s -> 25089.91s]  that so badly but we're con just ate the fucking whatever I'm not gonna blame
[25089.91s -> 25094.67s]  Rakan it's fun I'm so sad about that though they misplayed that so incredibly
[25094.67s -> 25101.21s]  badly like so badly it was just that like Rick Han all in the thresh with his
[25101.21s -> 25106.67s]  ultimate but all he had to do there was use his E to come back to me and then
[25106.67s -> 25110.57s]  play front to back afterward but he's to see he sat there auto-wing the thresh
[25110.57s -> 25114.77s]  but you don't need to auto him you just need to engage and then I can maybe
[25114.77s -> 25122.51s]  play after it I probably could have double killed them there too I kind of
[25122.51s -> 25130.46s]  messed up my team wants out it's not it's it's silly because the game's not
[25130.46s -> 25139.79s]  even over like we actually can win this game so incredibly easily so easily if
[25139.79s -> 25144.51s]  we just play it correctly because their balling is really fucking bad I didn't
[25144.51s -> 25148.23s]  want to be mean but I'll just be mean their balling is really fucking bad
[25148.23s -> 25165.88s]  Well, I'm dead. They're still bad. I'm just ego-ing. That was my ego. I still stand by
[25165.88s -> 25170.44s]  it. I still think they're bad. This guy's just playing 1v3 mid. The Thresh has not been
[25170.44s -> 25186.14s]  mid one time, so it must be the top laner. I'm so frustrated right now with this game.
[25186.14s -> 25190.98s]  Because I feel like we should have won so many all-ins that we didn't win like barely,
[25190.98s -> 25194.54s]  Right like barely didn't win small ends. I thought we should have won all of them
[25196.62s -> 25200.92s]  Like they they didn't land like a good all-in once Thresh didn't land a single hook once and
[25202.66s -> 25215.44s]  This is my Rakan like he just tried to he just used his R to try and engage I think Nocturne is done mentally
[25216.20s -> 25221.17s]  Okay, so in games like this
[25221.37s -> 25249.23s]  Like this Thresh is so bad. Oh, let's go, baby
[25249.23s -> 25278.48s]  huge that was so huge let's fucking go like I I'm gonna hit no at 15 because
[25278.48s -> 25283.60s]  dude I really don't want to lose to this Thresh and Asaya like this Thresh is
[25283.60s -> 25289.00s]  doing the most the most ego shit I've ever seen and he's just getting away
[25289.00s -> 25295.24s]  with shit like right there Thresh walks up whiffs every spell and expects to get
[25295.24s -> 25299.50s]  away with that shit no no no we win these we win these trust give me a
[25299.50s -> 25301.50s]  Let me cook let me cook. I
[25301.78s -> 25303.78s]  See my team to let me cook a bit, you know
[25304.62s -> 25308.98s]  Like we had a bad early game had to play weak side. Let me cook. Let me cook
[25310.50s -> 25343.60s]  We are chilling
[25343.60s -> 25384.72s]  If I landed that that would have been sick the rest is top two we can kill this guy come on guys don't forfeit
[25385.36s -> 25387.68s]  Guys the game is winnable. Oh my god
[25388.96s -> 25392.32s]  Dude the game is how is the Rick Han gonna forfeit?
[25394.52s -> 25397.40s]  Dude that game is so winnable it hurts
[25397.92s -> 25407.76s]  Ah, like dude, really?
[25407.76s -> 25413.58s]  That actually is so infuriating.
[25413.58s -> 25415.82s]  That's so infuriating, man.
[25415.82s -> 25418.50s]  That game was so incredibly winnable.
[25418.50s -> 25421.73s]  Like look at this.
[25421.73s -> 25425.73s]  I did more damage than every single player on the enemy team.
[25425.73s -> 25432.65s]  If my team just relaxed, we win the game a thousand times over that game.
[25432.65s -> 25436.17s]  Like, the game is over.
[25436.17s -> 25440.81s]  We have a Recon, a Rumble, and a Wukong for me to sit behind.
[25440.81s -> 25443.33s]  And we saw how bad their bot lane was, right?
[25443.33s -> 25447.39s]  I have Quendans for the only way they can kill me.
[25447.39s -> 25448.39s]  Whatever, man.
[25448.39s -> 25450.35s]  Dude, I wish to god, I'm gonna report them all.
[25450.35s -> 25453.43s]  These fuckers, I guarantee I get a notification.
[25453.43s -> 25457.64s]  There's no way these people are not toxic.
[25457.64s -> 25462.12s]  There's no way you just want out of a game after a fucking...
[25462.12s -> 25464.36s]  Your team is just doing well.
[25464.36s -> 25466.36s]  Nah, man.
[25466.36s -> 25471.36s]  The score is 10 to 14, 10 to 14.
[25474.06s -> 25481.50s]  You have a fed 80 carry.
[25481.50s -> 25488.50s]  Look at this, dude, we forfeited, we were down 2.5K.
[25488.50s -> 25491.66s]  We had a better scaling comp than them.
[25491.66s -> 25493.14s]  Like we outscaled them.
[25494.94s -> 25498.82s]  We have two dragons, we outscale them
[25498.82s -> 25502.42s]  and we're down 2.5K.
[25502.42s -> 25505.02s]  and my team rage hits forfeit.
[25506.50s -> 25510.10s]  Oh my God, that's so gross.
[25510.10s -> 25518.06s]  That is so disgusting.
[25518.06s -> 25524.46s]  So disgusting.
[25524.46s -> 25528.90s]  Why am I in a game with this player?
[25528.90s -> 25531.94s]  I'm 412 LP Masters.
[25533.46s -> 25540.26s]  I was in a game just now with a seven LP Masters jungler.
[25540.26s -> 25541.66s]  And he's not on a smurf.
[25541.66s -> 25545.42s]  This is not a smurf account.
[25545.42s -> 25549.61s]  Because last season this guy was D4.
[25549.61s -> 25551.53s]  So he's not on a smurf.
[25551.53s -> 25556.56s]  Why is this player in my game?
[25556.56s -> 25561.08s]  Why is this player in a 400LP master game?
[25561.08s -> 25562.20s]  Why?
[25562.20s -> 25569.89s]  Or rather why am I in a Diamond 1 game?
[25569.89s -> 25572.97s]  You can go to his previous games, he doesn't even have good MMR.
[25572.97s -> 25578.45s]  Like if you look at these games, they're all like 100, 200LP, right?
[25578.45s -> 25579.73s]  Why am I in this game?
[25579.73s -> 25583.37s]  Why did you put me in a game with this player?
[25583.37s -> 25585.61s]  Like this guy, I don't even care if he sucks.
[25585.61s -> 25591.21s]  I'm more frustrated the fact that these players mental boom at the first sign of any negativity.
[25591.21s -> 25593.11s]  Look at this.
[25593.11s -> 25594.23s]  They just give up.
[25594.23s -> 25598.07s]  First sign of anything negative, they go next.
[25598.07s -> 25601.63s]  Like I actually could have 1v9'd this game too.
[25601.63s -> 25605.47s]  But I'm not allowed to try 1v9 because my team once out of the game had fucking four
[25605.47s -> 25607.99s]  minutes or 15 minutes.
[25607.99s -> 25610.75s]  That sucks man.
[25610.75s -> 25612.47s]  The new system is trash.
[25612.47s -> 25618.55s]  Like I'm sorry, but the 4-15 system is good sometimes.
[25618.55s -> 25622.39s]  They should have a requirement that you have to be losing by x amount of gold for it to
[25622.39s -> 25624.15s]  kick in.
[25624.15s -> 25626.11s]  That should be it.
[25626.11s -> 25627.83s]  They should have a requirement.
[25627.83s -> 25634.48s]  You have to be losing by 5k plus for it to work at 15.
[25634.48s -> 25640.96s]  Like there needs to be something where there's a requirement because people are so stupid.
[25640.96s -> 25641.96s]  Right?
[25641.96s -> 25643.98s]  Like that game was 100% ours.
[25643.98s -> 25650.50s]  We had two dragons, we're down 2,000 gold at 16 minutes, and Wukong's 3 and 1.
[25650.50s -> 25652.00s]  We were down 4 kills.
[25652.00s -> 25657.58s]  Wukong's 3 and 1.
[25657.58s -> 25661.68s]  I'm literally insanely strong.
[25661.68s -> 25663.62s]  Even though we got weaksided, I'm still winning.
[25663.62s -> 25665.58s]  We just 2v2'd them bot side of the map, right?
[25665.58s -> 25668.90s]  We just won a 2v2.
[25668.90s -> 25674.06s]  Rumble's just like, like, ah, sorry, I'm just mad, I'm mad.
[25674.06s -> 25681.74s]  They need to require they need to require something other than four people like require four people and a gold lead or something like that's so cancer
[25684.62s -> 25691.60s]  That's so fucking frustrating man. Like I can't believe how bad people's mentals are
[25692.84s -> 25699.24s]  Like though, okay, I get it the the rumble and the the rumble and the nocturne. I understand wanting to forfeit
[25699.24s -> 25703.40s]  Okay, okay, they're having a bad game. They want out. They're raging. They need to get their frustration
[25703.40s -> 25705.40s]  I get it, but why are we forfeiting?
[25705.40s -> 25717.18s]  When Wukong is 3 and 1, I have 7 of our KP, I'm the 80 carry, I'm very strong. I just got my mythic.
[25717.18s -> 25728.18s]  We have 2 dragons. And Rakan's 4-fitting too. Ah, I don't know man. Ah, that's just frustrating is all.
[25728.18s -> 25739.50s]  Like, I'll be real, I carry this game every day of the week. Like, every day of the week I carry those.
[25739.50s -> 25770.65s]  So apparently riot is doing something about smurfing though, and I can't wait until they do
[25772.09s -> 25776.37s]  This is actually a really good thing that I wanted this that I wanted to talk about earlier in the stream
[25776.37s -> 25777.65s]  But I forgot
[25777.65s -> 25783.29s]  Apparently riot is like doing something to make smurfing harder because like apparently smurfing is outrageous right now and
[25783.81s -> 25787.43s]  I kind of think that they need to stop this too
[25788.25s -> 25792.49s]  So there's a there's a thing you can do in solo queue right now where?
[25792.49s -> 25800.41s]  where you can make a new account and you can duo with somebody on different accounts on
[25800.41s -> 25809.21s]  a new account and your MMR doesn't actually get like lowered.
[25809.21s -> 25817.17s]  So if you win a game, let's say you win a game, um, I think this is just him leveling
[25817.17s -> 25824.06s]  the account, but let's say, let's say you win a game and in that game, you duo with
[25824.06s -> 25828.52s]  somebody in a lower MMR right now when you do in a lower MMR I don't know if
[25828.52s -> 25832.70s]  this guy did this or not but when you do somebody in a lower MMR your MMR is
[25832.70s -> 25837.70s]  based on now the game thinks that you're in that MMR and you can do it in
[25837.70s -> 25842.62s]  placements so in your very first games for some reason there's no MMR lock on
[25842.62s -> 25847.90s]  placements so you can in your placements do it with somebody who's
[25847.90s -> 25853.26s]  like bronze right and you can play with them and then the game thinks
[25853.26s -> 25857.42s]  you're still winning so it keeps amplifying your MMR.
[25857.42s -> 25861.54s]  So I'm describing this really poorly but essentially you can duo in lower elos and
[25861.54s -> 25867.10s]  the game doesn't know your MMR belongs in that elo because you're winning in that elo.
[25867.10s -> 25870.38s]  The game can't figure that out for some reason, the algorithm.
[25870.38s -> 25877.30s]  So when they stopped duo queuing it still inflated their MMR to where it would be
[25877.30s -> 25879.30s]  if they had solo queued.
[25879.30s -> 25880.30s]  Does that make sense?
[25880.30s -> 25881.90s]  And what I'm saying?
[25881.90s -> 25886.22s]  So it basically says that they went like 10-0 in their placements, right?
[25886.22s -> 25891.58s]  So now they're in like a master tier MMR from a brand new account.
[25891.58s -> 25899.43s]  So now those people are in like D1 masters MMR, but they played, they won in gold.
[25899.43s -> 25909.85s]  I also don't think you, smurfing should be so easily accessible.
[25909.85s -> 25914.13s]  Like this guy's not a bad player per se, but I don't think he's a master tier player,
[25914.13s -> 25915.13s]  right?
[25915.13s -> 25918.01s]  Like this guy's a rumble player on a new account.
[25918.01s -> 25921.17s]  In that game alone, the fact he gave up tells me he's not a good player.
[25921.17s -> 25949.35s]  Dude, I'm a heavy advocate for Riot, you have to attach a verification to your accounts.
[25949.35s -> 25953.91s]  I know Riot would never do that, but I'm a heavy advocate for having to attach verification
[25953.91s -> 25957.31s]  to play ranked.
[25957.31s -> 25961.90s]  I think it'd be great, honestly.
[25961.90s -> 25963.30s]  I think it would help so much.
[25963.30s -> 25977.61s]  If you get your verification account banned, are you done for it?
[25977.61s -> 25978.61s]  Yeah.
[25978.61s -> 25981.21s]  You have to get a VPN to play, other than you would have to.
[25981.21s -> 25988.97s]  That's my point though, like if you get your verified account banned, right, like, okay,
[25988.97s -> 26005.94s]  that account's done.
[26005.94s -> 26011.94s]  Like I said, I don't think Riot would ever do it because it's too extreme and I don't
[26011.94s -> 26013.94s]  think Riot has the balls to ever do that shit.
[26013.94s -> 26015.42s]  VPN is only $5.
[26015.42s -> 26020.02s]  Yeah, but dude, are you gonna tell me that you're gonna buy it?
[26020.02s -> 26023.98s]  People who get banned on accounts typically get banned consistently, that's why they're
[26023.98s -> 26025.46s]  making smurfs.
[26025.46s -> 26026.46s]  Right?
[26026.46s -> 26032.84s]  So you're telling me somebody is going to be willing to pay $5 for a new phone number verification or whatever?
[26033.72s -> 26048.06s]  Every time they have to make a new account. They're not not you me
[26048.90s -> 26050.90s]  Lulu. Yeah. Yeah. Okay
[26051.26s -> 26053.26s]  Don't I have serfs? Yeah, I do
[26053.94s -> 26058.60s]  And I stand by all my serfs should be attached to the same like account
[26059.30s -> 26063.14s]  Like if you make a smurf, okay, this is what I think should happen
[26063.14s -> 26069.42s]  happen. You should be able to put all of your smurfs on one account, so you can make smurfs
[26069.42s -> 26075.58s]  and you can add that smurf verification to an account. But it kind of like battle.net.
[26075.58s -> 26079.70s]  Does that make sense? You know how like battle.net has all your accounts in the battle.net
[26079.70s -> 26084.94s]  thing, but you can sign into battle.net? I think that the way to make it viable would
[26084.94s -> 26089.14s]  be like you could put all, if you didn't have a second phone number or didn't want
[26089.14s -> 26091.72s]  you could put smurfs up to like a limit.
[26091.72s -> 26093.06s]  So you could have like three smurfs
[26093.06s -> 26095.14s]  or like two smurfs in your main account, right?
[26095.14s -> 26097.34s]  So you could have like three total accounts.
[26097.34s -> 26099.06s]  And you would have to like,
[26099.06s -> 26102.78s]  you could add those to the same like Omega account, right?
[26102.78s -> 26105.38s]  And that Omega account could be your verified account.
[26105.38s -> 26107.46s]  Now if any of your accounts get punished
[26107.46s -> 26115.24s]  on your Omega account, all of your accounts get punished.
[26115.24s -> 26116.56s]  So if any of your accounts get punished,
[26116.56s -> 26129.98s]  all of them get punished.
[26129.98s -> 26132.22s]  Like I feel like that'd be a good play.
[26132.22s -> 26134.22s]  Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like it would work.
[26134.22s -> 26135.44s]  Yo, what's up, Rush?
[26135.44s -> 26140.93s]  I called you Rush, what's up, R.F.?
[26140.93s -> 26142.45s]  Ah, what do I wanna play?
[26143.69s -> 26144.53s]  I don't know.
[26145.41s -> 26149.02s]  I don't know what I wanna do here.
[26149.02s -> 26151.34s]  It's a little ranged, okay.
[26151.34s -> 26152.62s]  I wish I didn't have cleanse.
[26152.62s -> 26154.94s]  Cleans is so worthless, this game, actually.
[26156.74s -> 26159.42s]  Cleans does nothing this game at all.
[26159.42s -> 26160.86s]  I'm just down to some.
[26160.86s -> 26163.38s]  Like, maybe if the brand tries to flash stun me
[26163.38s -> 26179.00s]  or some shit, but I'm just down to summoner.
[26179.00s -> 26180.76s]  All right, boys.
[26180.76s -> 26182.96s]  We got Nightblue3 on our team.
[26185.79s -> 26186.79s]  This is a throwback.
[26248.05s -> 26248.55s]  Damn.
[26249.25s -> 26249.95s]  Oh, we got him.
[26256.18s -> 26258.58s]  I'm not gonna lie, I kinda looked like I was scripting.
[26260.38s -> 26262.88s]  That movement, like if I was watching the game, I'd be like,
[26262.88s -> 26264.38s]  What the fuck was that?
[26266.18s -> 26268.28s]  Like my movement was real sus.
[26268.88s -> 26271.88s]  Well, on that like, that all in right there, that's some,
[26272.18s -> 26273.98s]  that's some, that's some sus movement.
[26305.89s -> 26306.89s]  We can gank these guys.
[26306.89s -> 26308.89s]  They have no, oh, there's gonna be a ward in here.
[26309.09s -> 26320.40s]  These people have no flashes
[26321.60s -> 26324.80s]  Enemy bot lane has no flash this should be just be a free kill honestly
[26326.12s -> 26329.96s]  We just let these guys push in they can't walk up and we just play for that
[26334.80s -> 26347.83s]  Even if they try and 3v3 we should just win the 3v3 because we're stronger. Oh, this guy's just dead. Yeah, it's I
[26358.40s -> 26360.40s]  Need level three. I
[26363.04s -> 26365.04s]  Kind of fucked my entire wave here
[26366.12s -> 26367.64s]  Yo, can we push?
[26367.64s -> 26391.08s]  Is there any way we can just push this? Oh nice. Nice. Well played
[26392.56s -> 26394.00s]  Nice job
[26394.00s -> 26406.26s]  My Lulu's fucking fetish shit. Oh, I should have gone free boots this game. I
[26407.14s -> 26409.14s]  didn't think about it
[26409.78s -> 26415.66s]  Cuz uh, I don't need Sork this game. You know how like the last game I told you I was going boots
[26415.66s -> 26417.66s]  I went boots for the uh
[26417.66s -> 26422.58s]  You know the fast boot to rush for thrash. I don't need that this game because
[26423.42s -> 26432.90s]  We just went through like faster mythic. So I should have gone free boots for like more efficiency
[26439.94s -> 26443.58s]  Can't understand knock just kill a man
[26444.58s -> 26446.58s]  You can't understand
[26447.22s -> 26470.17s]  Just kill a man. I want to push this way
[26471.01s -> 26473.01s]  So we don't get like shit on
[26500.23s -> 26502.23s]  Just kill a man
[26502.23s -> 26507.71s]  you can't understand just kill a man
[26507.71s -> 26513.79s]  kill a man there is something you can't
[26513.79s -> 26545.35s]  understand kill a man hmm I could go back
[26545.35s -> 26548.29s]  here but I don't see any reason to go
[26548.29s -> 26559.68s]  back yet I think I'm dead
[26559.68s -> 26567.22s]  oh I misplayed that that was actually
[26567.22s -> 26568.62s]  really good by Lula cool downs now
[26568.62s -> 26570.98s]  you're fine man I wish I could I wish
[26570.98s -> 26572.10s]  I could tell him that he played it
[26572.10s -> 26574.46s]  fine I messed up not him I messed up
[26574.46s -> 26584.89s]  I feel bad I want to like say no you're fine cuz that was my bad I
[26585.77s -> 26591.05s]  Should have okay, so when I flashed and I was running away from the twitch right the second that twitch flashed on me
[26591.05s -> 26593.05s]  I should have instantly started autoing him
[26593.21s -> 26598.51s]  Like I it was one extra auto like one single extra auto and it would have been fine
[26599.01s -> 26603.44s]  Why can't I tell her?
[26603.44s -> 26607.90s]  You know, I just choose not to type anymore
[26608.70s -> 26610.30s]  It's my choice
[26610.30s -> 26613.88s]  You know
[26613.88s -> 26619.89s]  Yeah
[26619.89s -> 26639.58s]  my choice
[26639.58s -> 26641.58s]  That guy's actually doing that, huh?
[26642.12s -> 26646.35s]  We win to be too really fucking hard
[26647.67s -> 26649.67s]  Especially with tier two boots, but I need a
[26650.67s -> 26666.72s]  Dude, I'm doing some scripty shit
[26667.28s -> 26669.04s]  I don't be real
[26669.04s -> 26678.88s]  Dude Lulu wasn't six. I thought she was six. I'm so bad. I
[26681.74s -> 26685.22s]  Wish I could tell her my bad again. I'm actually trolling
[26686.14s -> 26689.86s]  like I ran out of mana because I'm bad and then I
[26689.86s -> 26698.44s]  I uh and then I thought she was six so I walked up to like take tank the turret for a second right
[26698.44s -> 26701.40s]  because I was like oh shit maybe I'll get like maybe we can kill this guy maybe Lulule has a
[26701.40s -> 26718.93s]  spell or something I just oh I played bad my bad W that make sure Akko's not there I feel I
[26718.93s -> 26721.73s]  actually just feel so bad because the Lulule was actually playing really this is like the
[26721.73s -> 26726.53s]  best support I've had all day like this guy's actually impressing me right like this guy's
[26726.53s -> 26766.48s]  playing really well and I'm just griefing Lulu gave her life for me Lulu gave her
[26766.48s -> 26777.26s]  life for me boys can we get a salute for Lulu and chat boys we get a salute can
[26777.26s -> 26805.23s]  we get some love for Lulu she gave her life for the homie honestly that was a
[26805.23s -> 26811.79s]  really cool 2v2 by the way oh night was smurfing it what the fuck you'll
[26811.79s -> 26846.55s]  kill that bitch too. Niiiice. No. Ohhhh. If I lost that cannon I would have lost my life.
[26846.55s -> 26881.53s]  End game. I'm gonna go BT second item. We have Lulu. Uh, so wait, what the fuck is this
[26881.53s -> 26886.87s]  pathing? I clicked to go bot and it passed me in the weirdest spot ever. We have Lulu,
[26886.87s -> 26893.17s]  so I could actually go IE second, but I think if I go BT, I'll be actually unkillable.
[26893.17s -> 26899.32s]  it'll be the greatest thing ever. I actually still might go IE as I'm thinking about it
[26899.32s -> 26904.92s]  that loud by saying we have Lulu and not be stupid but hey. I still might you know I still
[26904.92s -> 26912.88s]  might go IE but I don't know yet we'll see. Because I took a Lackardy so it's like wow.
[26912.88s -> 26955.12s]  No I'm gonna die. I mean I don't know why I flashed away. I'm playing bad. It's
[26955.12s -> 26960.60s]  my fault I think the game's over so I'm just I'm playing bad I'm like limit
[26960.60s -> 26993.94s]  testing a little bit too much today
[26993.94s -> 27060.09s]  I'm surprised they haven't for put it though what the fuck dude how does this
[27060.09s -> 27063.41s]  This game? Oh, I'm even more mad, you guys have no idea.
[27064.53s -> 27068.93s]  So I don't, it's 24 to eight.
[27068.93s -> 27071.21s]  The enemy team doesn't forfeit,
[27071.21s -> 27074.33s]  but my team forfeits when the score is 10 to 14
[27075.87s -> 27095.77s]  and we're only down a thousand golds.
[27095.77s -> 27098.27s]  Sorry, I was, that was my bad.
[27098.27s -> 27102.40s]  I was tilted by, you know,
[27102.40s -> 27104.94s]  I was thinking about how they weren't forfeiting
[27104.94s -> 27106.04s]  and I was getting mad.
[27106.98s -> 27111.66s]  It is a little interesting because I said they still can't win so I don't know who the fuck setting no
[27111.66s -> 27115.08s]  But it's probably echo. Well, no echo is definitely heading no, but like who else
[27116.92s -> 27123.49s]  Maybe brand maybe ribbon maybe ribbons like yeah
[27124.09s -> 27129.14s]  They just get a thousand gold
[27129.14s -> 27139.16s]  All right, I should probably stop trolling. I feel pretty silly if we lost because I'm bad
[27139.78s -> 27141.64s]  After we like dumpster them and lay in that art
[27141.64s -> 27144.18s]  I feel pretty silly if we lost because I keep getting caught
[27144.18s -> 27163.04s]  All right, I should be unkillable now
[27163.68s -> 27168.14s]  Like I'm not even farming. I'm actually griefing. I
[27168.86s -> 27173.00s]  Should probably go make dinner after this game. I want to keep playing because I'm playing well today
[27173.00s -> 27177.50s]  But like dude my brain is starting to go like I probably need to go make some food
[27178.14s -> 27196.13s]  I'm getting the full ADHD brain experience going so let's see if I can muster all my focus
[27196.71s -> 27203.49s]  Let's see if I can muster up all my focus really quick just for
[27204.17s -> 27206.01s]  Push out and finish this game
[27206.01s -> 27215.15s]  We'll go terminator mode for the the end of this game right now. We'll muster up all of the all of the focus
[27224.13s -> 27227.21s]  Demon mode engaged boys. God. That was sounded really cringe
[27227.89s -> 27283.48s]  I'm actually really impressed though night blue played this game really really well like I'll be honest
[27284.04s -> 27287.84s]  My last like thought of night blue was him being bad at league
[27289.28s -> 27291.60s]  He played this game really well
[27294.87s -> 27296.87s]  My man's gotten so much better
[27296.87s -> 27327.14s]  Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. Nobody saw that. 되
[27327.14s -> 27342.34s]  Not wasted at all. They might actually go for Baron here. We should look for this. Like they could try. Oh he's here.
[27349.44s -> 27351.44s]  Pretty sure the ribbons here too though
[27352.82s -> 27355.42s]  Yep, I did not mean to do that. I
[27356.38s -> 27359.10s]  Didn't mean to hit the thing. I accidentally hit the blast plants
[27360.48s -> 27363.56s]  That was that was an accident. It was a it was a literal pure accidents
[27366.35s -> 27368.27s]  like I I
[27368.27s -> 27371.51s]  Did not mean to hit it. I was like I know ribbons here
[27371.51s -> 27375.79s]  I'm gonna wait for Yasuo before I go over or before I do this right and I'm gonna bait him
[27375.79s -> 27381.61s]  And I just completely whiffed every like I'm bad. We'll leave it at I'm bad. That's a good way to put I'm bad
[27381.97s -> 27385.69s]  I'm hungry. I'm old. I'm bald. I'm bad. Nothing else to say
[27386.85s -> 27388.85s]  Short to short mad
[27402.59s -> 27405.13s]  Yeah, that was a pedestrian flash
[27406.31s -> 27412.13s]  It is she as well. Oh, yeah, it's it's a plotter a plotter of terrible things. I
[27416.44s -> 27418.44s]  Still got to go to the gym tonight, too
[27442.77s -> 27444.77s]  Zed's butt. Okay
[27444.77s -> 27447.87s]  I'm a little nervous of like getting flanked
[27449.11s -> 27451.35s]  Right their junglers could just like sit in places
[27468.78s -> 27470.78s]  Nice we got top in him not bad
[27471.56s -> 27473.56s]  Yeah, I mean we just try and get mid and hit there
[27475.22s -> 27477.22s]  Well, let's go help our homie though
[27477.74s -> 27500.60s]  Like I'm actually so sad. I'm playing so bad
[27501.90s -> 27506.62s]  Like I was playing so good at the start and now I'm playing so bad that actually makes me sad. I
[27516.07s -> 27518.07s]  Was tanking for that guy
[27518.27s -> 27538.77s]  All right, let's just leave
[27538.87s -> 27544.59s]  I don't want to I don't want to throw the game for my my teammates because like I'm getting like, you know
[27546.97s -> 27583.06s]  I've already died five times like a dipshit. Oh, where'd he go? We should just push bot honestly
[27584.68s -> 27596.12s]  We don't even need this dragon
[27596.12s -> 27598.12s]  Okay, we just I'm just gonna push bot
[27643.96s -> 27658.62s]  Not bad
[27658.62s -> 27663.30s]  Not bad at all. I gotta give it to I want to give it to night blue, but I got to give it to this Lulu
[27664.30s -> 27666.30s]  Lulu played that game so good
[27669.03s -> 27693.61s]  Gotta give it to Lulu. She played so fucking good like actually. I don't even know if she's still in here
[27712.56s -> 27721.89s]  I'm not a scripter
[27721.97s -> 27723.97s]  She thinks I'm a no, I'm serious
[27732.61s -> 27734.61s]  She thinks I'm a scripter
[27739.22s -> 27758.72s]  Bro, I'm streaming
[27759.12s -> 27766.68s]  Dude the homie thought I'm a scripter. You know, I'll take it my ego feels good
[27776.11s -> 27778.11s]  Honestly, that feels good. That feels good
[27778.59s -> 27780.03s]  Hi, well
[27780.03s -> 27786.08s]  Thought I was a scripture dude. I'm not gonna lie though
[27786.28s -> 27793.40s]  Some of those movements were sus as fuck that I was making like I was I like I like turned on the fucking mental
[27793.40s -> 27797.00s]  Scripts for that game some of those movements early were nuts
[27799.60s -> 27801.88s]  Like like just like this tiny little
[27802.52s -> 27806.00s]  Tiny little movements. I was doing early game and lame were crazy
[27806.40s -> 27816.61s]  Like look at this watch this like this movement right here, right like look I dodged that right?
[27816.61s -> 27820.93s]  Then I walk up cleanse the thing kite down
[27821.53s -> 27829.80s]  Like that that movement is gross man. Look
[27832.12s -> 27836.52s]  That was actually some gross ass movement. I'm not gonna lie. Look at this
[27837.72s -> 27841.22s]  In the corner man in the corner
[27843.16s -> 27844.78s]  My brain was like
[27844.78s -> 27852.58s]  You know andromeda. Thank you, man. Yo, you played really good now. I felt bad
[27852.58s -> 27856.38s]  I felt so bad because I was griefing like I was
[27856.90s -> 27861.66s]  Like at the start of the game. We were just snow like I literally fucked up like three times
[27862.46s -> 27865.06s]  During like the really important fights, and I was like, oh, no
[27865.70s -> 27871.58s]  Yeah, thank you the best
[27871.58s -> 27873.58s]  Can I play Calista? I can
[27874.22s -> 27881.99s]  I'm trying to figure out if I want to play a Calista game or if I want to go make dinner
[27888.75s -> 27894.23s]  There was one other movement that I thought was kind of nuts. I did a really good movement to somewhere
[27894.23s -> 27898.24s]  I don't remember what it was
[27898.24s -> 27901.12s]  Here's where I fucked up. So right now I
[27901.60s -> 27907.04s]  Should have just been I for some reason my brain lagged and I should have just been sitting here. Um, I
[27907.72s -> 27910.28s]  Should have just cleansed and then started fighting the twitch
[27911.12s -> 27914.64s]  For some reason I didn't cleanse but this wasn't like your fault at all
[27914.64s -> 27916.44s]  Like I the second the twitch flashed
[27916.44s -> 27920.00s]  I should have insta cleansed the ignite and I should just been killing him
[27920.40s -> 27923.32s]  Like right now just like autoing because I can't get away from him, right?
[27923.44s -> 27926.64s]  But it took me an extra second. See how I I started fighting him now
[27926.64s -> 27936.13s]  Like I barely died. I wouldn't have died had I cleansed and had I just turned initially it was fine
[27936.13s -> 27946.34s]  And then like here I fucked up too because I went in and I thought we were six. Oh
[27954.38s -> 27956.38s]  I could have killed that guy. I
[27957.02s -> 27960.76s]  Should have gone forward one more. Oh, you know what I should have done there
[27960.76s -> 27963.38s]  I should have gone forward one more auto killed this guy
[27963.70s -> 27965.82s]  Lulu would have gotten six off of the kill
[27965.82s -> 27969.68s]  I would have used my speed to come back out then she could have altered me
[27969.68s -> 27971.68s]  We could have killed the uh
[27971.68s -> 27974.56s]  We could have got the twitch and then we could have turned on this echo too. Oh
[27981.86s -> 27984.34s]  This was a really cool 2v2. I
[27985.58s -> 27987.58s]  Actually thought this 2v2 was really sick
[27992.51s -> 27996.67s]  Lulu is a real one for this man. Listen. You're a real one for this one
[27997.31s -> 27999.63s]  You just took the death to save me
[28004.66s -> 28006.22s]  respect
[28006.22s -> 28012.67s]  Your real one for that
[28012.67s -> 28019.31s]  That was so good
[28019.31s -> 28022.51s]  Jesus was fun. Yeah, geez. You were the best support I've had today
[28022.51s -> 28027.15s]  Like legitimately you played better than all the other players in the sealer. That was really good
[28027.39s -> 28033.19s]  Like I was surprised I was telling my stream. I was like, yeah, this she's actually like they I said she's here
[28033.19s -> 28035.19s]  I don't know, you know, but I was like, yeah
[28035.99s -> 28039.51s]  She's playing super good. She's playing way better than all of my fucking teammates
[28044.36s -> 28046.08s]  Yo
[28046.08s -> 28048.08s]  What time is it six?
[28048.44s -> 28052.92s]  Man, do I want to do I want to keep streaming or do I want to go to or do I want to go get food and
[28052.92s -> 28059.10s]  Go to the gym. I can't like 24 hour fitness is not actually 24 anymore
[28059.38s -> 28062.30s]  So I'd have to go soon if I'm gonna go to the gym
[28062.82s -> 28068.50s]  But it is only like six
[28078.03s -> 28079.19s]  hmm
[28079.19s -> 28083.38s]  But I could just end on I
[28084.12s -> 28088.38s]  Could just end on the hitting the like 400 LP mark and just chill for now
[28088.96s -> 28093.93s]  Right like we had 400 LP. We'll probably hit GM tomorrow
[28095.65s -> 28098.41s]  So I could just chill for now and then we just hit GM tomorrow
[28098.41s -> 28108.01s]  That's probably a better idea because then I won't get mad like say say we get like like say we get another game like this, right?
[28109.33s -> 28114.33s]  Like say we get another game like this where like we're literally winning the game and my team's like no
[28114.33s -> 28117.93s]  Let's forfeit like that's gonna make me mad. I was mad. This is gonna make me mad, right?
[28117.93s -> 28118.81s]  Like I
[28118.81s -> 28123.23s]  So I'd rather just like get off on a good note like a happy note. You know like not be tilted
[28129.60s -> 28133.60s]  GM tomorrow. Yeah, I hope so. I've been I think I can get challenger back this year
[28133.60s -> 28139.60s]  but we got to get to GM first I'm telling you I this elo is so miserable like
[28139.88s -> 28146.64s]  Master tier is the worst elo. I've ever played in in my 12 years of
[28147.08s -> 28149.08s]  playing this game
[28149.36s -> 28153.30s]  Whatever NA 300 400 LP Masters is is
[28154.40s -> 28156.40s]  Literally disgusting
[28156.40s -> 28163.12s]  These these are not real people like I feel like half these games. We are playing with NPCs
[28163.60s -> 28170.88s]  who quite literally don't even, like, I don't even know what to say, they're bots.
[28170.88s -> 28176.18s]  And they can't be real humans, they get mad over nothing, they rage quit over nothing,
[28176.18s -> 28182.99s]  they give up at 15 minutes when we're winning the game, these cannot be real people.
[28182.99s -> 28189.27s]  So I swear to God, the game has to get better in GM, it has to get better.
[28189.27s -> 28193.35s]  There's no world that it gets worse.
[28193.35s -> 28203.76s]  I refuse to believe that because this is this is the worst grind I've ever had. Is it bad to be a bot?
[28204.20s -> 28208.27s]  Are you saying I'm bodiced?
[28208.27s -> 28216.56s]  Are you gonna cancel me because I because I don't like bots? I said it. I'm saying it. I don't like fucking bots. Well
[28217.28s -> 28221.20s]  Okay, I didn't need to add fuck. You know what? We're just gonna I'm gonna get off. I'm gonna. Yeah, that's it
[28221.20s -> 28222.80s]  That's it for me
[28222.80s -> 28227.44s]  I'm gonna get off voice. I'm tired. I need to go to the gym before I run out of juice
[28227.44s -> 28234.46s]  Make some dinner. I will be live tomorrow same time as today. I've been starting my stream at 10 a.m. My time
[28235.52s -> 28240.90s]  Maybe I'll do it tomorrow at 9 a.m. I don't know it's 10 or 9 1 between there
[28240.90s -> 28242.90s]  I always start my stream and so
[28243.40s -> 28247.04s]  And that's my time so it's like 7 8 9 PST
[28247.84s -> 28251.64s]  You're good at it. Thanks, man. I think I suck my goal is
[28251.64s -> 28255.40s]  is hopefully I can get Challenger back.
[28255.40s -> 28257.84s]  And then I'm not gonna play,
[28257.84s -> 28260.08s]  like I just wanna, my goal is Challenger
[28260.08s -> 28262.56s]  so that I can prove to myself.
[28262.56s -> 28264.44s]  It's a really stupid thing,
[28264.44s -> 28267.56s]  but I wanna prove to myself that I can still do it at 32
[28267.56s -> 28269.32s]  because 10 years ago was the first time
[28269.32s -> 28270.60s]  I started streaming this year, right?
[28270.60s -> 28272.92s]  I've been streaming for 10 years this year.
[28272.92s -> 28275.44s]  And so I wanna get Challenger
[28275.44s -> 28276.56s]  because when I first started streaming
[28276.56s -> 28277.40s]  I was in Challenger
[28277.40s -> 28279.28s]  and I wanna see if like after 10 years
[28279.28s -> 28282.24s]  I can still do it.
[28282.24s -> 28284.78s]  and then I'm never gonna care again.
[28284.78s -> 28286.50s]  This will be the only time I ever give a shit
[28286.50s -> 28287.80s]  about getting challenger in.
[28287.80s -> 28289.22s]  I just wanna get it, see if I care,
[28289.22s -> 28291.12s]  and then play for content, you know?
[28292.68s -> 28294.46s]  But yeah, it's just like personal stuff.
[28294.46s -> 28297.74s]  Welcome to the League of Draven.
[28297.74s -> 28300.74s]  See if the old man who has fucking arthritis
[28300.74s -> 28303.50s]  and fucking carpal tunnel and all that shit,
[28303.50s -> 28304.50s]  you know what I mean?
[28304.50s -> 28305.90s]  See if I can still do it.
[28307.14s -> 28308.84s]  Yo, thank you for the Twitch Prime, man.
[28308.84s -> 28310.64s]  I appreciate it, thank you so much.
[28310.64s -> 28312.20s]  Appreciate it a lot, dude.
[28312.20s -> 28321.20s]  Alright guys, that's gonna be it for me. If you like to stream, don't forget to follow all my socials and TikTok and Facebook and Instagram and all that shits, all the clickable garbages underneath the stream, don't forget to check it out.
[28322.20s -> 28324.20s]  I'll be back tomorrow, same time in the morning.
[28325.20s -> 28332.20s]  Tomorrow's my last day for the weekend though, I'm not gonna stream on Saturday. I might do some off-stream grinding on Saturday.
[28333.20s -> 28338.20s]  I've been like forcing myself to take a day off of streaming every week just so like I can mentally recharge.
[28338.20s -> 28344.76s]  And I think it's actually been really good for my stream because like I've been in a much better mood while streaming and I've been much
[28344.76s -> 28346.76s]  less tilted and I've been
[28346.76s -> 28350.92s]  Even if I play league off stream or whatever. It's just like it doesn't feel as forced
[28350.92s -> 28355.88s]  So I feel like the brakes nice. So yeah tomorrow no stream on Saturday tomorrow for sure and Sunday
[28355.88s -> 28361.16s]  I might I might do a short stream, but yeah, I'll see you guys then. Thanks for watching. I appreciate you guys
[28361.80s -> 28370.72s]  And yeah, that's it. I'm gonna go make dinner. Oh, we guys have a good night day wherever the fuck you are
[28371.52s -> 28375.52s]  Later dudes. Hope you guys have a good one. It was fun playing with Andromeda.
[28375.52s -> 28379.52s]  Go look on the games. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Peace!
