[190.19s -> 195.62s]  That guy has
[195.78s -> 207.54s]  GP
[207.54s -> 215.50s]  bees
[215.50s -> 254.09s]  Jesus
[254.09s -> 270.77s]  Yo, hey, what's up, man? What's up, dudes?
[318.94s -> 327.09s]  Yeah, I mean we're hoping we'll see you man. We'll see
[330.25s -> 390.83s]  Fingers fucking crossed right? Do I ever actually?
[392.15s -> 408.15s]  I'm wondering if I I'm assuming I'm just playing a math
[408.67s -> 463.24s]  No way. Hey
[463.70s -> 484.14s]  Yeah, this is probably just me doing fucking I'm probably just doing star guardian
[498.34s -> 502.54s]  Welcome to the y'all except for I'm drinking for the 27 months man. You're ah
[503.50s -> 530.98s]  Appreciate it a lot, dude. Thank you, and I could probably still go infinite team, but so I'm holding the solution
[531.72s -> 533.72s]  But I haven't seen any servers or anything
[534.80s -> 619.95s]  So I'd be kind of awkward, you know, this guy's definitely gonna beat me that guy's I
[621.03s -> 625.19s]  See why he hasn't lost. That's just five infinity team already. Jesus Christ. I
[626.27s -> 628.95s]  Was like man, why is that guy so strong and then I like realized
[629.55s -> 780.82s]  So I go to seven next rounds and then hopefully we can hit
[782.14s -> 806.36s]  some shit, I kind of like this actually because now we can make I
[807.64s -> 809.24s]  can actually make a
[809.24s -> 811.24s]  Guard breaker and I could also make
[811.76s -> 848.96s]  We go a guard breaker and math. I kind of want to just ionic spark, but I don't know if I should I need
[850.32s -> 852.32s]  an echo a
[852.40s -> 854.40s]  Niko or a rail
[854.40s -> 857.40s]  I also could use an Ezreal. I need like a quick draw.
[858.90s -> 860.90s]  I should have kept that Lucian from earlier.
[876.02s -> 880.02s]  This guy has a level 3 Blitzcrank and he's just so fucking strong it's stupid.
[949.42s -> 950.92s]  This is really interesting.
[956.06s -> 958.06s]  I guess I could go Spellslinger as well.
[975.23s -> 978.23s]  Then we just give the Shiv to TF.
[1006.48s -> 1007.98s]  We can just do this for now too.
[1035.71s -> 1037.21s]  I guess I could use...
[1040.68s -> 1042.18s]  I could do Jeweled Gauntlet.
[1044.00s -> 1047.01s]  I don't know.
[1047.51s -> 1050.01s]  Could Jeweled Gauntlet this shit up? See how it goes.
[1103.73s -> 1108.41s]  I need to like throw an item down, but I feel like Morello's is bad.
[1110.94s -> 1120.12s]  I guess I could just use hat or like I said before, jeweled gauntlet could be good.
[1128.06s -> 1148.36s]  I don't know. I could just roll on seven to try and three star stuff.
[1152.74s -> 1156.02s]  This guy has three Kaisas though. This guy has one Kaisa.
[1159.66s -> 1162.22s]  Kind of hard to three star Kaisa. I could three star Nyla.
[1190.70s -> 1193.38s]  They got some eight with fucking 20 gold.
[1193.38s -> 1198.22s]  Here he has MF.
[1198.22s -> 1297.79s]  And dude, Blitzcrank's insane.
[1297.79s -> 1357.52s]  Dude, that Gnar just murked me.
[1357.52s -> 1371.58s]  I did not position for the Gnar and I got fucked for it.
[1371.58s -> 1399.18s]  This motherfucker.
[1399.18s -> 1404.22s]  Dude, I wish I could get some thick frontline leveled up.
[1404.22s -> 1458.67s]  That'd be cool.
[1458.67s -> 1542.31s]  Oh my god, another Gnar.
[1542.31s -> 1543.83s]  Well, RIP.
[1543.83s -> 1546.43s]  I was gonna go MF and then I decided to go Niko
[1546.43s -> 1548.27s]  and then I just fucked it all up.
[1548.27s -> 1551.41s]  Oh well.
[1551.41s -> 1571.54s]  Oh well.
[1571.54s -> 1572.62s]  What time is it, 10?
[1597.78s -> 1598.62s]  Oh.
[1619.19s -> 1621.07s]  What's up, boys?
[1621.07s -> 1634.70s]  How's everybody doing?
[1634.70s -> 1643.42s]  Oh, I'll be right back.
[1643.42s -> 1646.82s]  Sorry, I'm still waking up, let me, give me one sec.
[1646.82s -> 1647.82s]  Sup Sky.
[1647.82s -> 1648.82s]  Oh.
[1648.82s -> 1649.82s]  Okay.
[1649.82s -> 1675.10s]  Woo.
[1675.10s -> 1676.10s]  Oh yeah baby.
[1676.10s -> 1684.84s]  I was gonna play on my main at the start but dude I don't know if I can sit through fucking
[1684.84s -> 1688.06s]  8 minute queue times to get people raging at each other all day.
[1688.06s -> 1702.82s]  So we'll uh we'll do some warm up on this account for a bit.
[1702.82s -> 1704.28s]  What MMR's this count?
[1704.28s -> 1706.22s]  Like D1 low master.
[1706.22s -> 1715.66s]  Like my other account's like 500.
[1715.66s -> 1717.94s]  This one's I wanna say like.
[1717.94s -> 1720.38s]  I don't know the MMR is really awkward.
[1720.38s -> 1723.32s]  When you get like well masters right like they're more super awkward
[1723.60s -> 1726.34s]  So I don't know what are they more as but I know it's a little masters
[1726.34s -> 1729.68s]  So like sometimes there's diamonds sometimes there's like hundred LP players
[1731.20s -> 1744.66s]  Somewhere between there dude, I I played some games off stream yesterday. I got up to like 400 LP
[1745.78s -> 1747.78s]  Then I lost three in a row
[1748.00s -> 1766.88s]  That shit was painful. I did into one of tenacity's games though. So that was fun that felt bad
[1766.88s -> 1774.56s]  Oh, yeah, straight up. It felt so bad. He was doing so good to like I straight up
[1774.56s -> 1782.07s]  Just had a bad game and I felt I felt like shit. Look at this shit. I just dropped like eight deaths. Look at the shits
[1785.03s -> 1787.95s]  Like he was just straight up smurfing on the enemy top laner
[1788.67s -> 1793.21s]  And we all the entire team just like decided to collectively run it down
[1793.71s -> 1805.06s]  Like we all just got shit on this was a really weird game because I feel like
[1808.17s -> 1814.41s]  That game was like the first game. I felt everybody in the game was like actually high GM challenger, but they weren't right at that
[1814.93s -> 1831.78s]  There's a very weird system going on. Let's do a Cassiopeia game. Like I'll show you guys what I mean in a second
[1832.02s -> 1845.39s]  I'm assuming I should go this right? This is probably good
[1846.19s -> 1847.99s]  or this
[1847.99s -> 1857.46s]  That's probably good, too. Oh, well, okay. So yeah, we'll get this stuff
[1857.46s -> 1867.70s]  I don't even know who the fuck this guy was.
[1867.70s -> 1874.72s]  Some random Senna player who's like not playing Senna now and then this guy was like trying
[1874.72s -> 1878.10s]  to jungle and just like running it down.
[1878.10s -> 1883.26s]  It was I don't even know it was the weirdest game that I've played in a while.
[1883.26s -> 1886.84s]  Because like my AD carry wasn't bad.
[1886.84s -> 1890.08s]  Like this guy is clearly like on a smurf but I don't know how good he was because he wasn't
[1890.08s -> 1892.60s]  bad at the game.
[1892.60s -> 1895.60s]  The enemy AD carry wasn't bad.
[1895.60s -> 1897.76s]  This guy's also on a smurf.
[1897.76s -> 1898.92s]  It was the weirdest lobby.
[1898.92s -> 1903.32s]  It was like a bunch of smurf accounts all playing with each other but it was like
[1903.32s -> 1908.55s]  a non smurf queue.
[1908.55s -> 1912.53s]  This guy was like the only non smurf.
[1912.53s -> 1913.53s]  It was interesting.
[1913.53s -> 1928.35s]  Oh do I take ghost here or do I just I feel like ghost could be really OP versus
[1928.35s -> 1941.34s]  their team with cassiopeia but maybe i should just take i'm gonna try it oh somebody dodged
[1943.40s -> 1946.76s]  because yeah i don't know i never know i never know if i should take ghost ignite whatever
[1948.68s -> 1952.60s]  because i feel like ghost with cassios feels like the same thing as ad carry right same idea
[1953.24s -> 1966.78s]  where it feels really op dude there's so much drama going on in the league community yet again
[1967.50s -> 1998.64s]  by the way like it's it's insane yeah i don't know man i i just i'm
[1999.28s -> 2007.96s]  I like I like looking at drama cuz like
[2008.68s -> 2035.34s]  Drama is juicy. Like I like looking at drama, but it's also like how are people so stupid? Yeah, I'm getting like I I
[2036.32s -> 2043.80s]  Don't know man. My view on all of this shit is like I I guess I'm just not hardwired that way
[2043.80s -> 2049.32s]  I I can't mentally wrap my head around being like excited to flirt with underage girls
[2049.32s -> 2063.01s]  or like when like I I just I I've never like had the want like it happens so much
[2063.01s -> 2068.69s]  between like league streamers and non like just it's not even a big thing it's just that we're
[2068.69s -> 2076.01s]  in the league community right so you see it more dude like well the drama is like a decent
[2076.01s -> 2079.77s]  size league streamer who is like getting bigger or whatever like the ad carry streamer
[2079.77s -> 2093.10s]  cookie or whatever he was like somebody made a 90 page 90 pages of google doc to basically like
[2093.10s -> 2099.90s]  expose this guy for like talking a bunch like sexually to underage girls not paying his fucking
[2099.90s -> 2117.02s]  like mods who do work for him and like other stuff and i'm like dude how man like just be
[2117.02s -> 2125.42s]  a normal human it's not that bad like take it from me being a normal dude it's not that bad
[2200.43s -> 2206.67s]  sorry i was distracted no uh yeah i don't know man i i swear to god people are just stupid as
[2206.67s -> 2213.63s]  fuck people are idiots there's got to be some psychological underlying issue with people's
[2213.63s -> 2215.63s]  Brain's not working, but it is what it is
[2219.04s -> 2221.36s]  Huh? I've had this barcode account for a while
[2222.80s -> 2224.80s]  Hmm
[2228.99s -> 2230.99s]  Dude, what is that taric skin?
[2234.00s -> 2235.28s]  Let's see this
[2235.28s -> 2237.52s]  Look at this taric skin, man. He's fabulous
[2238.72s -> 2240.72s]  God damn
[2240.80s -> 2242.80s]  My man's just straight up fabulous
[2256.52s -> 2258.52s]  People are desperate
[2258.60s -> 2263.96s]  I just can't like I don't think like i've been in a situation where I was like a really really big streamer
[2263.96s -> 2269.68s]  Like much bigger than he is and I got like I this is what I'm saying. It's like I understand
[2271.72s -> 2276.28s]  Like all of the crap that gets thrown at you like people will literally message you for no reason
[2276.78s -> 2281.48s]  Like you do have like fans that have like when I was at my biggest point
[2281.48s -> 2284.80s]  Like you you have fans that are younger girls guy
[2284.80s -> 2288.78s]  It doesn't matter and like you just got a like I just never in my mind
[2288.78s -> 2290.92s]  I guess thought like oh, I'm gonna flirt with these people like
[2290.92s -> 2296.22s]  It made me like I don't even I wouldn't even I literally didn't even see them as like sexual
[2296.98s -> 2302.53s]  in my brain
[2302.53s -> 2304.53s]  like it blows my mind and
[2307.04s -> 2311.00s]  Then the fact that like if you like if you look at the Google Doc or whatever
[2311.88s -> 2317.24s]  The fact that like taco like I keep a taco. Whatever. It was literally talking to him telling him
[2317.24s -> 2320.12s]  He was doing it like what he was doing was wrong. He was like, yeah, I get it, right
[2320.64s -> 2322.64s]  Then he did it again
[2322.68s -> 2336.28s]  Dude the set ulting the pussy that that
[2337.28s -> 2340.34s]  I'll be honest. That may be one of the funniest lines I've ever heard
[2355.04s -> 2361.78s]  Like dude, I mean whatever you know, I'm not here to kink shame whatever gets people off, you know, maybe maybe maybe that's a fetish
[2361.78s -> 2388.97s]  I don't know
[2394.87s -> 2399.66s]  Safe and sounds either way
[2401.06s -> 2403.06s]  Don't worry. We cannot talk about the drama real quick
[2403.06s -> 2426.69s]  We can talk about how old and washed up Wings of Death is though.
[2426.69s -> 2427.69s]  I'm kidding.
[2427.69s -> 2436.41s]  Yo, did you see on a lighter note though, did you see Riot?
[2436.41s -> 2439.93s]  There was like a Reddit thread or something where Riot was saying that they're like gonna
[2439.93s -> 2444.75s]  try and do something about smurfing in the next few months.
[2444.75s -> 2458.67s]  I don't know what that means, but can you tell us something involving Wings just between
[2458.67s -> 2459.67s]  us?
[2459.67s -> 2460.67s]  Yeah, yeah, just between us and all the homies.
[2460.67s -> 2461.67s]  Yeah, yeah, in chat.
[2461.67s -> 2463.67s]  Nobody else say anything. It's fine. Yeah, no
[2467.24s -> 2480.12s]  What's up? My chat ain't snitches
[2480.68s -> 2503.44s]  When I was a teen, I made a montage of him having breakdowns in my games. Oh my god
[2504.20s -> 2506.20s]  That's amazing. Oh
[2510.36s -> 2517.08s]  My god, that's amazing. I feel like I need to pay you to see this montage
[2518.16s -> 2520.16s]  Like I will give you money
[2521.36s -> 2548.91s]  Okay, I need this this is important to me. Oh, I have dude you should see that I have so many rage compilations
[2548.91s -> 2565.69s]  about me it's crazy so many I had a I had a villain arc for sure I feel it
[2565.69s -> 2575.18s]  just comes with like being a league streamer but you players are not all
[2575.18s -> 2590.51s]  mentally healthy homie let me tell you take it from me and okay I'd like to
[2590.51s -> 2614.46s]  think I'm not a villain anymore fuck you I really want this plate nice dude
[2614.46s -> 2626.44s]  Anivia's roaming. Why is there Wukong just sitting top by the way?
[2628.20s -> 2644.84s]  That's actually hilarious. You know, it's interesting. I feel like Taric actually
[2644.84s -> 2649.88s]  missed that stun. I was kind of side-eyeing that, but I feel like he missed that stun somehow.
[2671.80s -> 2676.28s]  I feel like this is the easiest game I've ever played by the way. I'm on full autopilot,
[2677.08s -> 2681.08s]  brain still waking up, and I feel like they're just walking into me on repeat. I'm
[2681.08s -> 2683.94s]  I'm just killing them all. I don't even know what the fuck's going on
[2685.54s -> 2690.80s]  Like they it feels like the enemy team has not like they didn't they didn't like understand we were playing league
[2691.26s -> 2693.72s]  Right, like they queued up and they were like, oh, yeah, this is league
[2694.98s -> 2696.98s]  That's what this feels like
[2697.70s -> 2700.82s]  This is what I imagine if like Mike Tyson went into a preschool, you know what I mean?
[2700.82s -> 2721.80s]  Like this is what this feels like
[2721.80s -> 2723.80s]  much say I
[2733.64s -> 2735.64s]  probably could have killed those guys, but
[2735.64s -> 2749.37s]  I don't want to the chill. I'm assuming the Wukong is gonna come bot soon
[2754.48s -> 2762.17s]  There he is
[2762.17s -> 2764.17s]  Damn it. I quenched late. I
[2764.77s -> 2766.77s]  actually kill both
[2767.01s -> 2769.01s]  That was a late cleanse by me
[2769.21s -> 2771.21s]  my bad
[2771.81s -> 2773.81s]  I don't want to take the risk coming back up
[2774.85s -> 2779.47s]  She stuns me they can one-shot me. I should have killed the fucking guy though
[2779.47s -> 2785.03s]  So, the Wukong, I just backed up too far and then I cleansed the stun for no, like, really
[2785.03s -> 2786.03s]  late.
[2786.03s -> 2798.12s]  Hi Jira, hey what's up man, what's up boys?
[2798.12s -> 2801.12s]  Good evening, good evening, good morning, I don't know where the fuck you guys live,
[2801.12s -> 2802.12s]  so good day.
[2802.12s -> 2816.75s]  The fuck am I watching?
[2816.75s -> 2827.71s]  Wait, that Wukong lived?
[2827.71s -> 2833.48s]  Whoa.
[2833.48s -> 2834.48s]  Bro.
[2834.48s -> 2838.98s]  Oh, and I'm dead.
[2838.98s -> 2843.66s]  Dude, that wall was BS!
[2843.66s -> 2847.50s]  There was like a little hole, and then I flashed late because I was like, oh, I can walk out the hole.
[2848.18s -> 2849.74s]  But I couldn't walk out the tiny little hole.
[2852.22s -> 2853.30s]  Motherfuckers.
[2854.62s -> 2857.10s]  I shouldn't have even been there, but like, I'm stupid.
[2861.89s -> 2862.81s]  I should've just pushed bot.
[2863.17s -> 2865.65s]  I was like, dude, that's such a bad fight, but I walked over to it.
[2865.65s -> 2866.53s]  I was like, I'm really fed.
[2867.77s -> 2872.73s]  Honestly, I probably could have killed him if I hadn't, uh, if I had like flashed the stun.
[2872.73s -> 2881.56s]  Annie stuns the only like most over like I swear if they reduced Annie stun by
[2881.56s -> 2887.64s]  like 0.5 seconds she would never get played like actually the only reason to
[2887.64s -> 2892.72s]  play Annie is her stun is just so OP because it's like a it's like the
[2892.72s -> 2896.20s]  reason they changed Taric so long ago where like when you have a point click
[2896.20s -> 2913.14s]  CC it's typically really broken okay I'm just dead
[2913.14s -> 2941.32s]  does taric not have ult leveled up at 6 he didn't level his ulti maybe it's
[2941.32s -> 2949.63s]  maybe taric ult sucks maybe it's underpowered you know now yeah you must
[2949.63s -> 2962.16s]  have misclicked honestly I'm just briefing I'm like playing too aggro for
[2962.16s -> 2966.68s]  like like I I threw my lead because I was like oh shit I'm gonna walk over
[2966.68s -> 2969.72s]  and help the homies you never walk over and help the homies when the
[2969.72s -> 2974.32s]  homies are getting shit on because if you have like 900 gold or a thousand
[2974.32s -> 2978.28s]  old lead like I did or whatever you don't want to do that's because you'll
[2978.28s -> 2995.76s]  give MF a ton of kills we're in a good spot now though but I am still a little
[2995.76s -> 3002.19s]  wait Taric oh wait leveled his ult nice this Taric does not know how to play
[3002.19s -> 3011.59s]  Taric by the way he's throwing out his stun so awkwardly that's okay
[3011.59s -> 3018.93s]  though I mean I apparently don't know how to play Draven so can't really
[3018.93s -> 3031.77s]  blame the guy I mean you guys are doing dragon with no smite but it
[3031.77s -> 3048.97s]  seems like doing dragon with no smite. I mean, we could fight these fights, but it's like
[3048.97s -> 3059.47s]  painful. We could easily fight these fights. I think a lot of it is just like, Taric isn't
[3059.47s -> 3062.67s]  confident enough to walk up and stun, right? Like that's, that's what I'm seeing the
[3062.67s -> 3066.59s]  issue is. He's doing the thing where like he's not, uh, he doesn't have the confidence
[3066.59s -> 3073.77s]  to actually walk up since he's a melee champ. So he's walking up and like taking half
[3073.77s -> 3081.37s]  his health and it's making him nervous. It happens a lot with players who aren't very
[3081.37s -> 3086.65s]  melee champ centric because melee supports are actually pretty risky or they're pretty scary
[3086.65s -> 3102.62s]  rather. Oh he's totally dead. I don't remember that. But yeah melee supports are scary to play
[3102.62s -> 3107.50s]  because you have to know when you can get a kill by going in because you're going to take
[3107.50s -> 3119.19s]  damage right that's just like the nature of melee supports nice we're coming back
[3119.19s -> 3123.59s]  in a bit not bad we threw a little bit early but yeah we're starting to get it
[3123.59s -> 3131.66s]  back we're showing. Taric's a never good. I'm always confused by Taric because he
[3131.66s -> 3135.58s]  feels like such a good champion like the champion itself feels broken as shit
[3137.66s -> 3140.22s]  like whenever I whenever I see Taric I think to myself like
[3140.22s -> 3152.30s]  like he's either unkillably like super OP or they're like 0-1-10 there's no in between
[3152.30s -> 3169.84s]  right like they either know how to play taric or they don't is what it feels like oh you
[3169.84s -> 3175.12s]  are i mean yeah you are wrong taric actually requires mechanics that's actually true
[3175.12s -> 3180.60s]  whereas like most supports like nautilus doesn't have mechanics you know and like
[3180.60s -> 3185.72s]  What's crank doesn't have mechanics. They just hit their button and if it if it works, they they get a kill
[3188.20s -> 3191.72s]  Whereas like tarik after you stun there is like stuff you have to do that doesn't make sense
[3207.13s -> 3210.18s]  or block
[3210.18s -> 3211.94s]  Do you think um?
[3211.94s -> 3213.94s]  Oh i'm gonna die
[3214.98s -> 3219.03s]  Oh, thank god
[3219.03s -> 3222.47s]  Do you think tarik's one of the harder supports? I think he's I think he's pretty hard
[3225.35s -> 3226.63s]  Like I don't think he's well
[3226.63s -> 3229.11s]  I mean he's harder than the other supports like I think like
[3229.11s -> 3231.87s]  I don't think there's a single support. That's hard. I
[3232.77s -> 3235.19s]  know I'm I'm toxic for that but I
[3236.07s -> 3241.43s]  Stand by it. Oh
[3242.55s -> 3260.96s]  I'm just gonna die. I'm not gonna turn flash. I don't think I should have just flashed over
[3261.44s -> 3267.16s]  But I kind of got baited by the taric old. I wanted to see if I could fight but there's too much CC. I
[3268.00s -> 3270.00s]  Was like, oh, he's ulting me. Let's go. I
[3271.94s -> 3275.74s]  Can tell this is a really low evil game because there's so much random deaths
[3275.74s -> 3281.74s]  Like I'm I'm falling victim to like I'm autopiloting and like I'm not thinking and I'm just talking to you guys
[3281.74s -> 3287.18s]  And I'm just dying for free, but it's like there's so many people just died for free. It's hilarious
[3287.62s -> 3290.66s]  Thresh Thresh isn't actually that hard. So
[3292.46s -> 3297.74s]  Like a lot of people think like Thresh mechanically is very difficult because he is harder than the other supports
[3297.86s -> 3300.54s]  But he's not actually that hard. He's like
[3301.10s -> 3304.30s]  Once you learn the Thresh combos, he's pretty much
[3305.74s -> 3312.61s]  a very upfront champion.
[3312.61s -> 3318.84s]  Yeah, like lantern, for example,
[3318.84s -> 3320.84s]  is one of the most broken things
[3320.84s -> 3321.84s]  to ever be put in league,
[3321.84s -> 3323.84s]  and everybody fucks it up.
[3323.84s -> 3325.84s]  Like, people will just mess up lantern
[3325.84s -> 3326.84s]  because they'll throw it for souls,
[3326.84s -> 3327.84s]  or they'll mess it up.
[3327.84s -> 3330.84s]  Like, you can literally just hold lantern perma,
[3330.84s -> 3333.84s]  and your AD carry can walk up,
[3333.84s -> 3335.84s]  auto the turret,
[3335.84s -> 3338.84s]  and they literally can't play the game after that.
[3338.84s -> 3346.50s]  Like, the enemy team I'm in,
[3346.50s -> 3348.56s]  Because like there's nothing they can do to stop it
[3349.08s -> 3352.46s]  We can totally fight this by the way
[3353.36s -> 3356.96s]  So like I've done that before we're like my thresh. Well, I know I have a good throw
[3356.96s -> 3358.96s]  Hold on. Let me let me win this team fight really quick
[3360.36s -> 3383.86s]  Give me a sec
[3383.86s -> 3387.62s]  Okay, cool. Sorry. I had to win that team power quick. Okay, so as I was saying
[3388.22s -> 3390.22s]  there's a lot more to thresh than
[3391.28s -> 3393.28s]  people think right
[3393.30s -> 3397.22s]  It's essentially people over complicate like what he needs to do
[3397.22s -> 3403.00s]  So it's like Thresh is a very basic, like when you see Thresh in pro play, you don't ever see like what you do
[3403.00s -> 3405.00s]  But it's very rare that you see like the sick
[3405.26s -> 3410.34s]  Permahooking like oh my god, like it's mainly like they pick him for like lantern
[3411.46s -> 3412.66s]  straight up
[3412.66s -> 3414.56s]  Like when they pick Thresh in high elo
[3414.56s -> 3422.34s]  He's not picked to be the god tier like always landing permacisi hooks like flay god like he's picked to like shut down engage and
[3423.66s -> 3425.50s]  remove
[3425.50s -> 3432.52s]  Kill threat to your carries. That's all he's picked for but he's literally just an EW bot
[3434.95s -> 3439.97s]  Armour stacking. I mean, yeah, the armor thing on Thresh is nice, but it's I wouldn't say it's like OP on his kit
[3440.63s -> 3446.09s]  It just makes him like not die to 80 carries in two seconds
[3446.65s -> 3457.82s]  What is happening? But I instantly know I'm playing with a good Thresh player when I can walk up to the turret
[3461.68s -> 3463.68s]  When I can walk up to the turret and the threat
[3475.52s -> 3479.76s]  Sorry, I was trying to think and talk at the same time when I can walk up to the turret my Thresh player
[3479.76s -> 3483.04s]  won't walk up and auto the turret with me. That's like the sign of a good Thresh player.
[3484.16s -> 3488.08s]  When we don't know where the enemy is and instead of walking up and trying to hit the turret to
[3488.08s -> 3492.56s]  like help you kill the turret, they'll stand in the back and literally just sit there and wait
[3492.56s -> 3500.80s]  and hold lantern until uh they just hold their lantern until like you can until you get ganked
[3500.80s -> 3507.87s]  essentially. And that's why like I said I just personally don't think Thresh's mechanics
[3507.87s -> 3512.43s]  are as hard as people think. I do think he's he's very knowledge based like I think Thresh
[3512.43s -> 3518.67s]  has high knowledge caps where like if you're playing I don't know like Lulu your skill is
[3518.67s -> 3525.31s]  basically like do I W your decision making on Lulu is literally do I W to speed or do I W to CC
[3525.31s -> 3529.71s]  right like that's your that's your decision making so it's like obviously much higher than
[3529.71s -> 3540.19s]  that but it's uh you son of a bitch but it's still not like that bad I think Thresh just
[3540.19s -> 3543.39s]  Intimidates people because he can do so much
[3544.67s -> 3549.15s]  And so I think people just get intimidated but because they they think it looks overwhelming to learn the champ
[3553.94s -> 3558.18s]  I feel like that actually intimidates a lot of people in terms of like people not wanting to
[3559.06s -> 3561.06s]  learn new champions and shits
[3561.86s -> 3563.86s]  I feel like a lot of it is just
[3564.66s -> 3566.10s]  um
[3566.10s -> 3568.82s]  People are nervous about learning champions that look overwhelming
[3569.54s -> 3572.46s]  right
[3572.46s -> 3577.90s]  Like Aphelios, for example, I was talking about this yesterday. Aphelios is not a hard mechanical champion, like
[3578.70s -> 3580.70s]  he's difficult in terms of
[3581.58s -> 3584.54s]  The knowledge required like he's knowledge gated very hard
[3585.42s -> 3591.66s]  Right. So like you have to play him a decent amount or like research him to understand what guns do what?
[3592.14s -> 3596.94s]  How to interact with the guns stuff like that, right? But the actual mechanics of using the guns
[3597.82s -> 3599.82s]  It's actually not hard
[3599.82s -> 3614.09s]  Guys, what are we doing?
[3614.09s -> 3618.93s]  I guess we're just winning the fight.
[3618.93s -> 3621.71s]  Pike?
[3621.71s -> 3626.58s]  Like, I think Pike's harder than Thresh.
[3626.58s -> 3627.58s]  Maybe that's a hot take,
[3627.58s -> 3631.82s]  but I think Pike is harder than Thresh.
[3631.82s -> 3634.46s]  Because Pike requires like really specific,
[3637.14s -> 3640.72s]  Pike is a lot harder to play than he looks
[3641.80s -> 3643.30s]  when you see people play him.
[3644.86s -> 3647.66s]  Because there's like timers of when you can go in
[3647.66s -> 3649.22s]  off of certain things.
[3649.22s -> 3652.66s]  Like hitting his ulti consistently in team fights is a little harder than people think.
[3653.46s -> 3658.70s]  And knowing how to position in the lane, like Pyke is capable of a lot more than people think.
[3659.58s -> 3663.98s]  So I think Pyke's, I think the reason, the main reason I think Pyke's a little harder is because he's melee.
[3668.97s -> 3673.29s]  Like melee champions are always going to be like mechanically more difficult than ranged.
[3673.93s -> 3680.52s]  If the melee champion is like, you have to engage to go in and do stuff.
[3681.60s -> 3683.40s]  Because there's always the counterplay factor.
[3683.40s -> 3693.72s]  support role? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's like, I'm not saying overall, like overall
[3693.72s -> 3697.96s]  range champions require a lot more mechanics than melee. Just because you're ranged, you
[3697.96s -> 3702.12s]  can die in a global and you have to space and stuff. But I think that like in just
[3702.12s -> 3707.06s]  the support, you support support specific, I think mailings are a lot harder to play.
[3707.06s -> 3711.68s]  That's why you see a lot of like support players. We give like the best support
[3711.68s -> 3715.08s]  players in the world are really good at like the engage melee supports, not the
[3715.08s -> 3719.14s]  like enchanters and that's why you see like why we praise the best support
[3719.14s -> 3725.04s]  players because like when you see somebody go in like perfectly on Rakan
[3725.04s -> 3732.02s]  or go in like find a way in without getting knocked up on like I don't know
[3732.02s -> 3736.70s]  something like when they find the angle on Thresh and it's really nice
[3736.70s -> 3754.44s]  Rell I think Rell sucks I think that champ is so bad because she just like
[3754.44s -> 3761.82s]  Like she doesn't do anything.
[3761.82s -> 3767.54s]  Like Rell's initial thing was like she was supposed to go in, be really tanky, and then
[3767.54s -> 3771.26s]  be like a stun bot for like team fights, she was a team fight monster.
[3771.26s -> 3776.46s]  But the problem with Rell is like she has one chance essentially in lane phase, like
[3776.46s -> 3781.40s]  if anybody has fingers on their hands and they can move left and right, Rell's really
[3781.40s -> 3782.98s]  easy to dodge.
[3782.98s -> 3786.04s]  Like it's actually like it's incredibly easy to beat a Rell in lane to not die
[3786.04s -> 3787.04s]  to her.
[3787.04s -> 3791.92s]  like you just have to move left and right right it's very simple so it's like it's much more
[3791.92s -> 3799.36s]  difficult to dodge like other engaged champs if that makes sense like nautilus you can still
[3799.36s -> 3803.28s]  move left and right but it's like he can walk at you while it's happening whereas like if
[3803.28s -> 3809.20s]  rao walks at you i'm still like just waiting for the animation and then i can simply move to
[3809.20s -> 3816.16s]  the left because like her animation is so slow on using her ability that i can like dash i can
[3816.16s -> 3821.60s]  flash I can there's so much counter play and it's like unless she flashes on you but it's even then
[3821.60s -> 3827.68s]  you can tell she's gonna flash on you so it's like I also feel like mid game rel has this issue
[3827.68s -> 3834.00s]  where she has her one trick ulti engage fight in team fights but after she does that she does
[3834.00s -> 3842.60s]  literally nothing right she's like a one and done that's why like she feels like she doesn't
[3842.60s -> 3851.08s]  have other expression.
[3851.08s -> 3853.92s]  She's countered so hard by the meta too.
[3853.92s -> 3856.92s]  Meleeo counters relengage.
[3856.92s -> 3858.96s]  Thresh counters relengage.
[3858.96s -> 3859.96s]  Right?
[3859.96s -> 3876.04s]  Like, either of those champions shits on relengage and you can't do anything.
[3876.04s -> 3881.52s]  Like I don't know if you've ever tried to play Rell, gone in and been like, Thresh-flayed,
[3881.52s -> 3884.44s]  but it's the worst feeling.
[3884.44s -> 3888.04s]  It's a bad feeling.
[3888.04s -> 3889.40s]  It's like when people play Leona.
[3889.40s -> 3891.96s]  It's the same reason Leona's shit right now.
[3891.96s -> 3900.78s]  justbask2kazam They're both good at doing what they're supposed to do, like stun and
[3900.78s -> 3907.06s]  create pressure and point click and shit, but the problem is, you can easily counterpick
[3907.06s -> 3910.90s]  them so incredibly hard that they just become worthless the whole game.
[3910.90s -> 3916.35s]  Have you ever gotten Senna's secondary mission?
[3916.35s -> 3919.07s]  Oh, all the time.
[3919.07s -> 3922.51s]  With Thresh being meta and Senna being a champion I'm playing a lot, I get that
[3922.51s -> 3926.07s]  all the time.
[3926.07s -> 3929.31s]  You don't even notice it though, I'm gonna be real.
[3929.31s -> 3932.01s]  When you kill the Thresh or whatever and you get his souls, you don't even fucking notice
[3932.01s -> 3940.51s]  it because like, it's like 40 armor, and it's like your level 17 or some shit at that
[3940.51s -> 3941.51s]  point.
[3941.51s -> 3946.29s]  Like at the point you're getting it, you're such a high level that like the 40 random
[3946.29s -> 3948.95s]  armor like it's nice, but I never really notice it.
[3948.95s -> 3958.72s]  Planning to get your teammates ahead isn't that good?
[3958.72s -> 3962.64s]  You know what I've actually been doing as support on my main account?
[3962.64s -> 3977.91s]  I've actually been roaming non-stop and it's super OP because the key to roaming is all
[3977.91s -> 3984.07s]  you have to do to roam well is literally be there one or two times in the first five
[3984.07s -> 3990.31s]  minutes of the game to completely fuck over the enemy one time on an engage or something
[3990.31s -> 3998.62s]  and they get so far behind from it that you can literally just walk back bot.
[3998.62s -> 3999.98s]  Like I do it on Senna.
[3999.98s -> 4001.22s]  Like I'll push bot lane.
[4001.22s -> 4003.94s]  This is my strategy on Senna, I'm gonna give it to you guys, okay?
[4003.94s -> 4010.98s]  So I don't know if this works in low elo, but in like high masters this works at least.
[4010.98s -> 4012.22s]  This is all I do on Senna.
[4012.22s -> 4016.86s]  Every single player I play against on Senna, every single one except for like Pyke players,
[4016.86s -> 4020.28s]  even Nautilus, Blitz, they all can seed lane level one.
[4020.28s -> 4021.28s]  Every single one of them.
[4021.28s -> 4022.28s]  Right?
[4022.28s -> 4024.12s]  They just let me push level one.
[4024.12s -> 4028.62s]  And so I'll push the waves in level one and I'll either crash wave two or
[4028.62s -> 4034.86s]  wave 3 depending on how far they're giving me like push power right so i will always crash wave 2 or
[4034.86s -> 4045.82s]  wave 3 bot and i will immediately roam mid every time and even if i don't get a kill
[4047.02s -> 4054.06s]  usually it fucks over the enemy mid laner so badly because on that exact timer there's usually
[4054.06s -> 4063.60s]  a gank happening on mid. So a lot of the time people think that you're roaming to
[4063.60s -> 4069.44s]  get a kill for the laner. You're not. You're roaming to counter pressure from
[4069.44s -> 4075.69s]  the other players in the game. How many times have you guys been like, oh we can
[4075.69s -> 4078.83s]  win this 2v2, you see the enemy jungler, your jungler comes, you're like,
[4078.83s -> 4081.71s]  oh we're gonna bait this, and then all of a sudden the support shows up and
[4081.71s -> 4084.97s]  you're like, god damn it, and then you die and you're like, what the fuck.
[4084.97s -> 4089.89s]  that right there is how easy it is to play support because all you have to do
[4089.89s -> 4096.45s]  is show up once twice and now that entire lane is fucked for the enemy team
[4096.45s -> 4106.92s]  roaming is so easy the only thing people fuck up roaming really bad when
[4106.92s -> 4112.08s]  they roam on timers where their AD carry can't safely farm so what ends up
[4112.08s -> 4115.08s]  happening is on that timer right where like I told you wave two three
[4115.08s -> 4119.84s]  right what happens is you push that wave in you roam mid let's say
[4119.84s -> 4125.94s]  nothing happens, okay? I can just walk back bot. You lose nothing. And if usually at that
[4125.94s -> 4129.92s]  point you're not, you have like 300 golds, so there's no point backing, right? Now let's
[4129.92s -> 4135.56s]  say like I notice that my jungler is like invading top side. I just walk over to top
[4135.56s -> 4141.84s]  and help him. Because you have like three to four, you have like three to four waves
[4141.84s -> 4150.92s]  before the enemy bot lane. The enemy bot lane has to play it almost perfectly to
[4150.92s -> 4157.26s]  able to abuse your roam on certain timers. They essentially have to play it perfect to
[4157.26s -> 4162.96s]  abuse the roam. What I mean by that is like, the way the best way to abuse support roaming
[4162.96s -> 4171.12s]  is you either A, if you have the ability to dive, you can pretty much A immediately dive,
[4171.12s -> 4174.56s]  like push the next wave and then immediately dive if you like have that ability, say
[4174.56s -> 4178.32s]  you're playing Leona Draven or something. But even then it's a little risky, because
[4178.32s -> 4183.10s]  then the AD carry can just walk back and they only lose one wave and you gave up, you know,
[4183.10s -> 4189.40s]  a stack chance. So it's not that bad. Two, you can stack the wave. Now, stacking the
[4189.40s -> 4194.30s]  wave is the best way to counter it. Because let's say I'm roaming for an extended period,
[4194.30s -> 4197.48s]  you stack like a three wave, and then all of a sudden you're crashing it and my
[4197.48s -> 4200.48s]  and then you want to like you're up a level because you've been gaining XP and
[4200.48s -> 4205.08s]  the AD carry has to back off. But the way to counter that is you simply just walk
[4205.08s -> 4209.86s]  back on the timer of the stacked wave crashing as an AD carry or as a support.
[4209.86s -> 4211.84s]  It's so incredibly easy to do.
[4211.84s -> 4214.58s]  It's actually brainlessly easy to do.
[4214.58s -> 4220.64s]  Like it's literally you can roam all you want bot lane as long as you are in bot
[4220.64s -> 4225.18s]  lane for the stacked wave crashes or you are in bot lane when your jungler is bot
[4225.18s -> 4230.91s]  side of the map.
[4230.91s -> 4234.19s]  It's easy as fuck.
[4234.19s -> 4237.07s]  But support players drool on themselves.
[4237.07s -> 4243.53s]  So they like to essentially, support players like to like afk in the lane phase.
[4243.53s -> 4248.31s]  They like to literally sit there and just do nothing.
[4248.31s -> 4255.34s]  That's like the average support I see is they will stand and do nothing and and I've
[4255.34s -> 4258.34s]  said this before but I'll say it again, being a good support is not being a better
[4258.34s -> 4259.94s]  player than the enemy team.
[4259.94s -> 4264.22s]  Being a good support is queuing up to play League of Legends.
[4264.22s -> 4265.66s]  That's that's all it takes.
[4265.66s -> 4268.84s]  All it takes to be a good support is queuing up with the intent to push buttons
[4268.84s -> 4504.24s]  in the game and not just afk all right i'm back what's up i don't remember what we're talking about
[4504.80s -> 4514.71s]  oh supports yeah they're all stupid don't afk on support you'll gain lp so it's that it's actually
[4514.71s -> 4532.55s]  that easy honestly i don't think supports are stupid i think it's more of a uh how do i phrase
[4532.55s -> 4539.24s]  this it's uh in my opinion it's more of like uh they're like they they've never they don't
[4539.24s -> 4549.59s]  have to learn support players like don't have to learn uh important things because they can
[4549.59s -> 4553.11s]  get away with not doing it so they get they develop bad habits that's all it is
[4562.63s -> 4573.68s]  do you have a spotify playlist yeah best role to climb i think every role is good to climb
[4573.68s -> 4578.64s]  as long as you're good classic jara oh i don't see whatever you linked like i don't know
[4578.64s -> 4583.76s]  about links in the chat because i had to turn them off a long time ago so i can't see it
[4583.76s -> 4595.38s]  I would say that climbing is just about like whatever because every role you can climb on right like every single role
[4595.62s -> 4606.76s]  So climbing a lot of the time is just about what you think is most fun for you and you can get the best at
[4606.76s -> 4608.76s]  I would say
[4609.28s -> 4610.76s]  objectively
[4610.76s -> 4614.52s]  the best roles to climb on our jungle and support for just like
[4615.68s -> 4619.90s]  Higher elo well jungle and lower elo support and higher elo. I
[4621.32s -> 4623.32s]  Wouldn't climb on support in like gold
[4624.20s -> 4627.92s]  Cuz you're not gonna have a good time trying to like help bad players play the game
[4629.40s -> 4631.40s]  Bad it's mean
[4631.40s -> 4636.04s]  People who don't like you can get it like a gold Ezreal 30 kills by being the better support
[4636.24s -> 4637.96s]  But you won't always win
[4637.96s -> 4644.10s]  Where's like if you really want to control solo queue and your teammates aren't like good enough to carry at that level
[4644.24s -> 4650.86s]  By themselves right like you get frustrated just pick something that has more agency in the game
[4650.86s -> 4667.46s]  I mean, you could play AD, if you think it's, AD carry is interesting.
[4667.46s -> 4678.94s]  I wouldn't say it's like fun, but it's not, it's not bad.
[4678.94s -> 4680.34s]  You're in gold.
[4680.34s -> 4682.22s]  I mean, you could try it.
[4682.22s -> 4685.36s]  My view on it is if people were wondering if they want to play a role or not, my
[4685.36s -> 4687.18s]  view is just try it, see if you like it.
[4687.18s -> 4689.44s]  Cause if you don't like the role, you're not going to be able to put in enough games
[4689.44s -> 4690.84s]  to get good at the role, right?
[4690.84s -> 4693.38s]  So like, just give it a try.
[4693.38s -> 4697.62s]  if you enjoy it or not and if like it's not fun then if it's not your play style it's not fun
[4698.18s -> 4700.82s]  because 80s are very unique play style from all the other roles
[4702.58s -> 4708.82s]  like they're the reason people don't like playing 80 carry and like like watching 80
[4708.82s -> 4716.94s]  carry streamers and shit is because it 80 carry is like it's boring 80 carries like
[4719.05s -> 4722.89s]  zero like like if there was a graph of shit going on when you're playing 80 carry in the
[4722.89s -> 4726.43s]  the game it's like this there's like spikes to a hundred and then it's back
[4726.43s -> 4735.40s]  to like this right it's like ad carry is a lot of every game is different
[4735.40s -> 4743.20s]  right every game when you play 80s different because you're always with a
[4743.20s -> 4746.24s]  different player like a different support unless you do oq so every ad
[4746.24s -> 4751.68s]  carries games difference coupled with you spend a lot of the game just
[4751.68s -> 4756.16s]  farming like you don't get to interact with the enemy a lot so you just kind of farm a lot of the
[4756.16s -> 4762.64s]  game and even then you also like you basically are farming for like little dopamine hits of like
[4762.64s -> 4769.44s]  team fights and stuff that you get around the game so that's kind of fun but it's like i said
[4769.44s -> 4774.48s]  it's all you you can climb on any role i think 80 carry requires the most mechanical skill to
[4774.48s -> 4780.16s]  climb because the difference between uh climbing is like a jungler is about being in the right
[4780.16s -> 4784.32s]  spot at the right time, right? Like you need to path this way, get objectives, etc. Climbing
[4784.32s -> 4789.12s]  as an AD carry is more about like this person fucked up their positioning, I'm gonna kill them.
[4789.12s -> 4823.44s]  Type shit. We're gonna start with Q. Also, I wanna say something. If you are playing,
[4824.40s -> 4829.60s]  make sure, and this is just a really good standardized bit of advice, make sure you're
[4829.60s -> 4833.28s]  always tracking what the enemy cooldowns are, what their spells are, stuff like that.
[4833.28s -> 4840.82s]  Okay, because playing the game is not just about like farming and you know
[4840.82s -> 4843.86s]  Like your team goes into you auto and shit like right now mids me. All right
[4843.86s -> 4849.32s]  I can see that varus is mea, but it is a varus. So like I'm not too worried about being like level two by Varus
[4850.04s -> 4853.82s]  Not that much right so I can kind of play backward because I know that
[4854.90s -> 4859.10s]  It's a high chance. He's not gonna run bottom level two is a Varus now that was like a fizz or some shit
[4859.10s -> 4860.54s]  I immediately back up
[4860.54s -> 4865.16s]  So we noticed that it's pretty obvious. We're con probably got w level two. We don't know what it is
[4865.56s -> 4877.25s]  but he has Q so he doesn't have shield which means because he doesn't have shield uh it's hard for
[4877.25s -> 4881.81s]  the recon to get back out if he fucks up and engage so you need to think about these type of
[4881.81s -> 4887.33s]  things right now this is wave four i believe and because it's wave four we're gonna get level
[4887.33s -> 4894.61s]  three on wave four you always get level three on wave four if you have full xp you get level
[4894.61s -> 4901.57s]  two on wave two and you get level three on wave four and uh these timers for when you get
[4902.85s -> 4911.14s]  certain level ups bot lane are very important now i'm gonna hover over here uh you see how fiddle
[4911.14s -> 4918.18s]  is right here i'm actually gonna just walk in here and see if i can like yeah we see him nice
[4919.54s -> 4924.18s]  see this is exactly what i was talking about before do you see what my support is doing
[4924.18s -> 4926.82s]  I I left the lane
[4927.94s -> 4934.54s]  Guys, I walked to like stand next to my jungler after we pushed the wave in my Lulu is
[4935.66s -> 4959.47s]  Hanging out by herself bot lane. They should just chill it. You don't want to do that
[4960.43s -> 4965.45s]  You don't ever want to be the guy who's like by yourself bot lane as a support
[4966.71s -> 4967.95s]  because
[4967.95s -> 4970.91s]  You don't like supports don't need gold right? Not really
[4971.27s -> 4973.79s]  And you don't need farm you don't need all that shit
[4973.79s -> 4978.35s]  So if your ad carry roams and unless the wave is fucked and they're just being stupid you have to fix the wave
[4978.35s -> 4980.67s]  Or something you don't want to be by yourself in the lane
[4981.23s -> 4983.23s]  It just doesn't do anything
[4983.67s -> 4988.15s]  How do they not auto tower? Oh, uh, I used
[4989.15s -> 4994.87s]  Tilda so there's a way there's actually a setting you can have in the game where when you hit a button
[4995.31s -> 5002.71s]  It makes it so that I can't physically hit anything but a champion. It's target. It's called target champions only
[5003.03s -> 5007.57s]  And it's basically like here. I'll do it for you right now watch you see how like I can hit the tower you see how
[5007.57s -> 5008.79s]  It's the red
[5008.79s -> 5010.79s]  sword
[5011.15s -> 5014.77s]  So when I hit this button, I can no longer hit the tower or the minions
[5015.91s -> 5017.91s]  But I can still hit the champions
[5019.63s -> 5025.45s]  So essentially when you're fighting at a big minion wave or you're fighting under a turret you don't want to miss click
[5026.85s -> 5029.19s]  you just hit target champions only button and
[5029.19s -> 5033.79s]  And it makes it a thousand times easier because you can literally only hit the champion
[5034.19s -> 5051.23s]  It's really nice and you can make the button anything you want. Obviously. I just I use tilde. That's the default
[5051.23s -> 5061.52s]  I actually want to kill these guys, but I need to wait for the wave to push out just a hair
[5062.60s -> 5066.68s]  The jungler could be bought but it is a fiddlestick. So it's like I don't really care about a Phil sticks being bought
[5067.00s -> 5082.95s]  We can straight-up just kill them. Okay. Well, apparently we can't kill them
[5086.88s -> 5089.92s]  Because apparently my Lulu didn't want to walk up
[5090.88s -> 5095.80s]  That's so frustrating man, I did fuck up my my auto there
[5095.80s -> 5101.38s]  But I am a little I am kind of curious what happens. I'd have to go watch the VOD
[5101.38s -> 5106.30s]  I fucked up my kill in the Xayah. I think I walked to left instead or down my movement was bad
[5106.64s -> 5110.88s]  Like essentially when they fought right I walked like this. I should have walked like this
[5111.80s -> 5115.16s]  Because you want to cut off the Xayah from the gank now
[5115.16s -> 5118.92s]  I do think when Lulu just blindly ran away. I think she kind of griefed
[5118.92s -> 5124.00s]  You don't need to insta run from ganks, especially when like you could see what I have right? I have Dirk and Sheen
[5125.50s -> 5131.16s]  Something that a lot of people do as well is they will see that like the numbers are uneven and they'll instantly run away
[5131.16s -> 5135.00s]  They don't think about like how to win the fight or like what the the win con is of the fight
[5135.32s -> 5137.26s]  Because that's what I was saying before we got ganked right?
[5137.26s -> 5141.92s]  I was like fiddle can't gank us and he can't pre six fiddle does nothing in the gank. I had cleanse
[5142.92s -> 5148.72s]  They don't actually beat us in 3v2. So the problem was is we weren't focusing the same target
[5148.72s -> 5154.04s]  I went for the Zyia and she backed really far up now if we had played forward a bit
[5154.40s -> 5158.64s]  Like say she played a little more forward with me that would have gone a lot better or if I had played a little more back
[5158.64s -> 5166.40s]  With her it was basically like we don't have comms. So the you know, it got rough now fiddle is six now
[5166.78s -> 5168.78s]  So it's a little scary. I
[5169.50s -> 5173.48s]  Don't like playing versus fiddle sticks for like the reason of like 90% of the time
[5174.42s -> 5178.18s]  Players don't know how to ward around fiddle people put wards in weird spots
[5178.74s -> 5182.87s]  We should have won that fight though. I'm a little salty
[5183.65s -> 5194.64s]  Mainly myself. So this too Lulu keeps speeding me up
[5197.32s -> 5206.21s]  I'm gonna be honest with you. I don't like when Lulu's do that. It's like a pet peeve thing of mine when Lulu's use their speed
[5206.89s -> 5210.45s]  Okay, I'm okay with it if I need to dodge something or I need to chase somebody
[5210.73s -> 5214.49s]  But I think it's just so much less value than using it to CC early game
[5214.49s -> 5222.45s]  Early game the CC of Lulu like using W is so broken to me because they they just physically can't move their character for
[5222.89s -> 5232.78s]  Like 1.5 seconds, which is crazy. I think Fiddle's bot
[5234.34s -> 5236.34s]  You can kind of tell
[5236.84s -> 5242.50s]  You see how they're playing really aggressive. They don't beat us 2v2
[5243.08s -> 5245.86s]  So I'm thinking and they just cleared this ward out
[5246.74s -> 5251.14s]  I'm thinking Fiddle is either on dragon or he's bush ganking bot somewhere
[5251.66s -> 5259.92s]  So I don't really want to walk up. You see how this guy is confidently hitting the turret?
[5260.02s -> 5267.04s]  This is making me think Fiddles trying to lane gank because they cannot beat us 2v2
[5267.46s -> 5274.74s]  Like I think Fiddles in here. So I'm actually just gonna play safe
[5276.38s -> 5278.38s]  Until we see him on the map, I don't know
[5279.46s -> 5290.51s]  I'm not gonna take the chance because
[5291.95s -> 5296.71s]  You got to think about like what you see and what you don't see on the map like we can't physically see Fiddle, right?
[5296.91s -> 5300.55s]  But think about this. We don't see him top. That's something you have to think about
[5300.67s -> 5306.67s]  we we had a ward on rift just now for 15 15 seconds right we didn't see him top
[5307.87s -> 5316.80s]  so like if he's not top where is he now i think he finally left this looks like he went to dragon
[5320.43s -> 5337.32s]  yeah what are we doing by the way i mean i guess i'm just gonna die now would be the time to speed
[5337.32s -> 5347.36s]  me i mean i don't even know what to say about that malzahar just didn't walk gragas didn't
[5347.36s -> 5354.56s]  flashes E, Malzahar didn't walk. You always walk there by the way. I want to make this clear.
[5355.20s -> 5360.96s]  If you're a mid laner and you're playing a late game scaling mid, you always walk to the fight
[5360.96s -> 5366.32s]  no matter what though. If it's at, if it's going, if it's doing that. Okay guys,
[5368.16s -> 5378.32s]  we need to walk to fights and Lulu you need to follow up when I go in. Don't run. I'm just
[5378.32s -> 5383.21s]  I'm just gonna type it because I'm actually fucking annoying. I'm a little frustrated
[5383.21s -> 5389.79s]  I still think the game is 100% winnable, but I'm playing Draven. We're playing like I'm playing fucking Ezreal or some shit
[5390.55s -> 5395.51s]  And I can't walk up because essentially we know fiddle was bought for the last two three minutes, right?
[5395.51s -> 5407.45s]  He just sat down there. What is my Lulu doing? Bro? What are you doing?
[5410.64s -> 5412.64s]  No, we we fight this go
[5413.32s -> 5422.17s]  Yeah, this guy doesn't get to do this for free now. They have a gale force. So I need to be a little care
[5423.13s -> 5430.64s]  This guy has no ulti though. Like this is what I'm losing my mind, man
[5431.56s -> 5433.56s]  like dude just
[5433.60s -> 5438.58s]  Borrow
[5438.58s -> 5442.22s]  No, what she was doing was she was trying to protect her ward
[5443.98s -> 5445.82s]  She saw the recon hitting the ward
[5445.82s -> 5448.62s]  But the Zaya walked up to get a free to just die
[5448.98s -> 5453.24s]  The problem is my Lulu was like, oh, I don't want to give up my ward and she wasn't thinking
[5453.86s -> 5459.82s]  please
[5459.82s -> 5461.82s]  Just sit with me. Okay
[5462.70s -> 5470.14s]  I need you to follow me, always.
[5470.14s -> 5474.70s]  Even if it looks scary, you gotta follow.
[5474.70s -> 5484.05s]  Okay?
[5484.05s -> 5489.97s]  Also, one thing is there's actually not a lot of fighting that happens in lower elo,
[5489.97s -> 5493.57s]  so a lot of these players don't know how to fight early.
[5493.57s -> 5497.69s]  Because one thing that I think has gotten really bad about League lately, just in
[5497.69s -> 5503.09s]  the past few years is people don't ever limit test in league ever anymore they
[5503.09s -> 5507.09s]  always just play like pussies every single player in league plays like a
[5507.09s -> 5519.16s]  fucking pussy nowadays and it's it's literally just like sad to see like
[5519.16s -> 5532.19s]  right there why aren't we w-ing use W on the Xayah not to speed like I'm
[5532.19s -> 5535.51s]  losing my mind because all you have to do there is W the Xayah she gets
[5535.51s -> 5540.39s]  cc'd we kill her in the w i'm telling you lulu players are like hard
[5540.39s -> 5561.92s]  wired for some reason to not play correctly
[5561.92s -> 5570.79s]  i'm never gonna catch this guy he's got gale force and tier two boots
[5570.79s -> 5573.51s]  yeah i mean i i have to go for it though because if i don't go for kills
[5573.51s -> 5576.23s]  now the game's over so it's either we go for it or we
[5576.23s -> 5582.02s]  lose so i'm willing to like look stupid
[5582.02s -> 5586.10s]  honestly this game was my fault for the one 2v3 that happened early i
[5586.10s -> 5588.34s]  misplayed it and if i didn't misplay that we
[5588.34s -> 5594.66s]  would have won the game off it. Now the game's pretty much over. Like it's solo queue so we can
[5594.66s -> 5600.42s]  always come back but the problem is uh I don't think we have good enough players to come back.
[5600.42s -> 5609.57s]  Like look at what Lulu's doing. Lulu why are you bot solo at the moment? Think like what
[5612.37s -> 5624.76s]  what are we doing? This is exactly what I was telling you guys. It doesn't make sense.
[5624.76s -> 5629.52s]  Remember when I told you support's easy? All you have to do is be a human.
[5629.52s -> 5633.44s]  Remember when I said that 40 sec or four minutes ago before the game started?
[5633.44s -> 5639.94s]  All you have to do to play support is think, push buttons, and be active in the game.
[5639.94s -> 5642.66s]  And if you can do those things, you'll get challenger on support.
[5642.66s -> 5651.17s]  Like it blows my mind. Like look at what you did. What are you doing?
[5651.17s -> 5673.87s]  This is a forfeit though. I'm gonna lose my mind.
[5673.87s -> 5682.95s]  And auto-filled AD.
[5682.95s -> 5691.56s]  I'm gonna lose it.
[5691.56s -> 5692.56s]  My bad, guys.
[5692.56s -> 5693.56s]  I'm an auto-filled AD.
[5693.56s -> 5694.56s]  I'm just bad.
[5694.56s -> 5695.56s]  It's on me.
[5695.56s -> 5704.34s]  I apologize.
[5704.34s -> 5705.34s]  Oh, man.
[5705.34s -> 5710.13s]  These players are crazy.
[5710.13s -> 5715.62s]  I'm actually really surprised we're just not forfeiting now.
[5715.62s -> 5719.10s]  The best way to play the game is something that, like, I fall victim to, too, where
[5719.10s -> 5721.12s]  I fuck this up sometimes, right?
[5721.12s -> 5725.06s]  But the best way to play the game a lot of the time is you essentially don't play
[5725.06s -> 5728.22s]  to take risks.
[5728.22s -> 5738.60s]  I know it sounds silly because you got to find essentially you have to find the um, my malzahar
[5738.60s -> 5746.68s]  just let um let this guy this 1000 gold walk away hey mouse if you moved by the way you
[5746.68s -> 5776.40s]  get 1k gold mid isn't hard role i can mid in my sleep it's not ad is easiest role i'm
[5776.40s -> 5792.22s]  ad carry streamer i play ad but lulu is small brain that was mean lulu took some some crossfire
[5792.22s -> 5817.20s]  there that she didn't need to take that was my bad that was toxic i'll be real i think uh today
[5817.20s -> 5822.88s]  is gonna be a mute all kind of day listening to low elo players talk about the game and then
[5822.88s -> 5826.24s]  they think that they're right about the game and like how it works and all this shits it
[5826.24s -> 5831.14s]  It actually like hurts me, like it shouldn't, I should just laugh it off, but sometimes
[5831.14s -> 5834.60s]  when I see a low elo player talk about how they think the game should be played and I
[5834.60s -> 5842.43s]  just know that they're wrong, it actually like physically hurts me.
[5842.43s -> 5853.92s]  It does, it physically hurts.
[5853.92s -> 5858.06s]  But I should follow my own rule, where if you're playing with people that aren't
[5858.06s -> 5861.48s]  as good, like they don't see what you see, right?
[5861.48s -> 5866.44s]  There's like something where it's better to play safe and scale, even on Draven.
[5866.44s -> 5877.08s]  It's better to play safe in scale than to go for plays in lane, mainly because if you
[5877.08s -> 5882.04s]  go for plays in lane and let's say your support is not as good as you, or your support's
[5882.04s -> 5886.06s]  not confident in their ability to 2v2, then you're just going to lose.
[5886.06s -> 5889.86s]  So you're like forcing that person to be in an uncomfortable situation.
[5889.86s -> 5895.78s]  So it's hard for me as a player to just play safe when I see the enemy making
[5895.78s -> 5902.04s]  Mistake after mistake. It's like something that I have trouble like personally working on right just like a personal issue
[5902.50s -> 5906.46s]  Where like I'll see an enemy make a mistake positional wise. I'm like, oh shit
[5906.46s -> 5909.42s]  Let's abuse this but a lot of the time the problem that happens is
[5910.34s -> 5915.78s]  You have somebody who doesn't know that that person made a mistake or doesn't see the same mistake as me and because there's no
[5915.78s -> 5918.22s]  Combs, I can't relate to them that we should fight, right?
[5918.34s -> 5921.02s]  So if I go in and they don't know that we should be fighting there
[5921.02s -> 5924.70s]  I end up dying and it looks it feels really bad
[5927.30s -> 5929.30s]  Which is I mean
[5929.50s -> 5934.18s]  My fault. It's like a personal thing because you can't control your supports. You can only control yourself
[5934.98s -> 5937.52s]  It's just something that like I suck at doing sometimes
[5939.26s -> 5968.22s]  Right, so that's just on man. We could actually kill the Zyra now, by the way, she's like 60% HP
[5968.98s -> 5995.73s]  Like we could kill her. What is my gragas doing? Oh
[5997.33s -> 6006.84s]  He got her though nice, bro use W
[6008.04s -> 6011.62s]  To CC people.
[6011.62s -> 6018.74s]  Not to speed people.
[6018.74s -> 6020.18s]  That was a good example too.
[6020.18s -> 6027.16s]  Oh well.
[6027.16s -> 6029.66s]  I just gotta get better at doing that where I play safe though.
[6029.66s -> 6030.66s]  That's on me.
[6030.66s -> 6059.88s]  That's just a personal thing I gotta get better at.
[6059.88s -> 6060.88s]  Oh man.
[6060.88s -> 6061.88s]  I think we're warmed up though.
[6061.88s -> 6065.08s]  What AD carry do you guys wanna see next game?
[6065.08s -> 6066.92s]  That was, that was a brutal ass game.
[6066.92s -> 6071.56s]  I'm gonna be real, that was a brutal ass game.
[6071.56s -> 6072.96s]  What AD carry streamer do you guys wanna see?
[6072.96s -> 6073.96s]  Or AD carry stream.
[6073.96s -> 6077.26s]  ad carry champion.
[6077.26s -> 6078.46s]  Do you guys want to see this game?
[6078.46s -> 6084.68s]  I just goofed up and tried to play too aggressive
[6084.68s -> 6086.68s]  with a player that wasn't willing to play aggressive.
[6086.68s -> 6087.28s]  That was on me.
[6088.78s -> 6089.68s]  That's my bad.
[6089.68s -> 6093.16s]  I'll play better.
[6093.16s -> 6109.65s]  This guy.
[6109.65s -> 6111.35s]  This guy goes Sion.
[6117.54s -> 6120.44s]  Oh, never change.
[6120.44s -> 6121.74s]  Twitch chat never change.
[6126.54s -> 6143.51s]  Well, the thing is, is you have to change my mindset.
[6143.51s -> 6144.21s]  So like the thing.
[6144.21s -> 6150.21s]  Okay, let me explain something. It's like a personal thing with me. I'm very very very good mechanically at this game, right?
[6150.21s -> 6152.29s]  Like it's my best trade is like I have very good mechanics
[6153.09s -> 6155.91s]  So and I also have like an autistic weird brain
[6156.73s -> 6161.69s]  Where I can see I have really good pattern recognition
[6161.89s -> 6168.33s]  So when I see that the enemy is fucking up, I know that I'm pretty much always gonna be better at the 2v2
[6169.29s -> 6171.29s]  Okay, so
[6171.29s -> 6181.29s]  Because I know that I'm always going to be better at the 2v2, I always want to take the fight when I see that they make a mistake.
[6181.29s -> 6186.29s]  Like they miss a skillshot or they walk up too far, stuff like that, right?
[6186.29s -> 6190.29s]  But the problem is when you're bot lane, you have to work with a teammate.
[6190.29s -> 6192.29s]  And that's part of just playing AD carry, right?
[6192.29s -> 6194.29s]  And if you're in solo queue, you can't always duo.
[6194.29s -> 6204.29s]  So you have to... I have to like train myself to just be okay with them making mistakes and us not abusing those mistakes.
[6204.29s -> 6208.29s]  It's very frustrating for me personally because I'm a perfectionist.
[6208.29s -> 6212.29s]  So it's very frustrating for me to like see this happening and I'm like, oh, I want to abuse this because I know we can.
[6212.29s -> 6219.29s]  But we have to like, I have to like tell myself not to and to just like not fuck up the wave state, not take bad trades and shit.
[6219.29s -> 6223.29s]  Because every time there's there's more to it too. So if I walk up and I take a fight, right?
[6223.29s -> 6228.97s]  a fight right let's say like when rakan w'd in when the fiddle ganked for example right uh if i
[6228.97s -> 6235.13s]  take that fight i'm now banking that fight on lulu also playing correctly right like they they
[6235.13s -> 6243.21s]  missed all their abilities and they fucked up but i also messed like you nobody can play perfectly
[6243.21s -> 6247.61s]  every game like i can't teammates can't nobody can it's league we're all humans right so you
[6247.61s -> 6251.61s]  have to bank when you're doing that on like your teammate being able to know what you want
[6251.61s -> 6254.49s]  want to accomplish in that moment in solo queue with no
[6254.49s -> 6257.49s]  comms. And it's really hard. Like it's it's a really bad
[6257.49s -> 6261.29s]  mindset that I have sometimes. But it's hard to get over
[6261.29s -> 6265.81s]  because like, I like the landing phase for me is the
[6265.81s -> 6271.19s]  most fun part of the game. I love landing phase. Because in
[6271.19s -> 6273.31s]  my opinion, landing phase is like a little mini chess game
[6273.31s -> 6276.59s]  between the enemy ball in right. It's like a it's like
[6276.59s -> 6279.59s]  a chess game with like mechanics, where it's like,
[6279.59s -> 6283.07s]  How well can I auto space them, right?
[6283.07s -> 6284.87s]  Can I space them well?
[6284.87s -> 6287.07s]  Can I space them, like, can I, by spacing,
[6287.07s -> 6288.69s]  I mean, can I walk into them, trade,
[6288.69s -> 6290.99s]  and not take damage back, right?
[6290.99s -> 6291.83s]  And I'm always thinking to myself,
[6291.83s -> 6292.89s]  like, okay, can I do that?
[6292.89s -> 6293.73s]  I can.
[6293.73s -> 6295.39s]  And then I'm like, I wanna do this, right?
[6295.39s -> 6296.99s]  And then I'll, like, get somebody to half,
[6296.99s -> 6299.59s]  and then they'll panic and they'll engage on me.
[6299.59s -> 6301.87s]  And the problem is, though, is, like I said,
[6301.87s -> 6304.03s]  without comms, or without, like, people
[6304.03s -> 6307.19s]  who are recognizing what you're trying to accomplish,
[6307.19s -> 6308.53s]  sometimes
[6308.53s -> 6315.43s]  Supports and in junglers people get flustered and it will go badly and it's my fault at the end of the day because I'm choosing
[6315.43s -> 6318.15s]  To that play style of relying on my teammates
[6318.63s -> 6324.17s]  Instead of like knowing that I can probably outscale and play better late game and just like keep good CS and not die
[6324.17s -> 6326.83s]  And shit, which is what you guys should all do
[6326.83s -> 6330.87s]  And that's what I tell people to do when they ask me how to play ID
[6330.87s -> 6333.57s]  I tell you like don't die scale up get items
[6333.57s -> 6338.03s]  But like because I've played the game for so long and my favorite part of the game is
[6339.95s -> 6344.95s]  Lane phase and like winning lane and playing that little chess game. I fuck myself over in a lot of games
[6345.63s -> 6351.75s]  because I'll like, you know force fights that like my teammate would have to play well in as well to win and
[6352.47s -> 6357.95s]  I'll make a mistake or they'll make a mistake and we'll just lose the game off it and it's not a good play style
[6359.59s -> 6361.59s]  Right, it's not a good play style
[6361.59s -> 6367.43s]  But that's just like something that like I know other people probably also have and I'm
[6367.43s -> 6370.67s]  telling you that like if you want to climb you got to get out of that mindset and get
[6370.67s -> 6379.37s]  into the mindset of like consistency because you can see last game for example I just
[6379.37s -> 6385.89s]  straight up like lost the game off of me trying to fight when my support didn't know
[6385.89s -> 6393.43s]  how to fight or want to fight and we lost the game off it like I was too aggro
[6393.43s -> 6395.99s]  And even though if they did play correctly, we win.
[6395.99s -> 6397.47s]  They didn't, so we lost.
[6397.47s -> 6399.91s]  So it's basically like, it's just not like a good,
[6401.11s -> 6404.23s]  it's not a good, what's the word I'm looking for?
[6405.11s -> 6412.48s]  Strategy.
[6412.48s -> 6415.00s]  Because last game was my fault.
[6415.00s -> 6417.20s]  Because I'm good enough at the game
[6417.20s -> 6418.96s]  that I know that I can't play like that
[6418.96s -> 6420.84s]  if I want to be consistent.
[6420.84s -> 6427.40s]  And I still played like it, so it's my bad.
[6427.40s -> 6428.56s]  All right, what are we playing this game, boys?
[6428.56s -> 6431.24s]  We got Rengar, Karma, Jin.
[6432.24s -> 6433.08s]  What do people wanna see?
[6433.08s -> 6435.48s]  Let me see if any of the AD carries people want to see if I can play these.
[6437.38s -> 6439.08s]  I can't play Vayne into this.
[6439.08s -> 6440.78s]  Vayne would be way too hard in the Karmagen.
[6440.78s -> 6442.38s]  I would just get zoned off the wave.
[6451.08s -> 6452.08s]  I could play Aphelios.
[6453.48s -> 6455.28s]  This is actually a good Aphelios game.
[6459.66s -> 6460.76s]  You know what kind of sucks?
[6461.26s -> 6465.76s]  I feel kind of bad playing Aphelios when I'm on my like teaching account.
[6466.46s -> 6467.76s]  Like this account I like teach you guys.
[6468.46s -> 6470.36s]  I feel bad playing Aphelios sometimes.
[6470.36s -> 6477.48s]  Uh, because I know a lot of people don't want to learn Ophelios or play Ophelios because
[6477.48s -> 6486.62s]  he is like really, he's very unique, but he's, he's hard to learn for a lot of people.
[6486.62s -> 6491.52s]  So I feel, I always feel kind of bad doing it, right?
[6491.52s -> 6492.52s]  But I'll be real.
[6492.52s -> 6497.76s]  I don't know in this specific situation outside of like jinx, I didn't really
[6497.76s -> 6503.24s]  know what else to pick. Like Jinx is good. Kai'sa is probably okay, but you still get
[6503.24s -> 6518.13s]  zoned off the wave on Kai'sa. Because like if we if we look at this, right? Kai'sa would
[6518.13s -> 6524.47s]  have been, I guess, okay. But when you're picking a champion for bot lane, right?
[6524.47s -> 6527.77s]  When you're picking a champion for bot lane, one thing that you guys should think about
[6527.77s -> 6530.63s]  when picking like what you know what champion you want to play, unless you're a one
[6530.63s -> 6533.73s]  trick and then play whatever you want. But if you're like somebody who wants to actually
[6533.73s -> 6537.65s]  like play the meta and learn why champions are meta and when to pick what.
[6540.94s -> 6547.58s]  They picked Jhin Karma. Now, we have a Lulu. If we had something with a hook, like a Nautilus,
[6547.58s -> 6552.70s]  a Blitz, a Thresh, a Pyke, like if we had something like that, I could pick a low range
[6552.70s -> 6556.54s]  fighter, right? Like I could pick a low range fighter if we had a hook champ.
[6557.98s -> 6562.54s]  But because we don't have a hook champ and we have an enchanter, I have to pick something
[6562.54s -> 6568.78s]  that can safely consistently farm and not get zoned off by their bot lane so there's not a lot
[6568.78s -> 6574.06s]  of options that can do that there's like i didn't want to you could pick ezreal here it's not the
[6574.06s -> 6578.30s]  worst but we had a lulu so i didn't want to pick ezreal because lulu goes to waste so it's like
[6578.30s -> 6581.66s]  you could pick jinx but i kind of didn't want to pick jinx this game because jinx bores the
[6581.66s -> 6586.78s]  shit out of me right now so uh this would be a good jinx game though if you guys are
[6586.78s -> 6594.26s]  curious like this would be a completely fine jinx game your e stops rengar jump uh you can follow
[6594.26s -> 6601.14s]  up really easily with lulu like this would be a good jinx game um but a phallus it's a good
[6601.14s -> 6605.78s]  phallus game too it's both it's got a phallus game good jinx game um it could be a good
[6605.78s -> 6611.54s]  zary game zary wouldn't be that bad here with lulu and against their comp uh they're all
[6611.54s -> 6615.54s]  really squishy she's really mobile can get away from like rengar ganks pretty easily
[6615.54s -> 6623.74s]  Tristana is unique because you only pick Tristana if you plan on winning lane.
[6623.74s -> 6630.14s]  Tristana doesn't actually scale better than Jinx in any way.
[6630.14s -> 6633.90s]  Like she does not have a better scaling than Jinx.
[6633.90s -> 6639.82s]  Trist vs Jinx 3 items. Jinx wins every time in team fights no matter what.
[6639.82s -> 6642.82s]  Like she just does what Trist does better.
[6642.82s -> 6648.50s]  there. Now the reason you pick Trist is because you do want to win lane, you want to like
[6648.50s -> 6651.50s]  jump in, you want to kill them, you want to be aggressive, right? So that's what you're
[6651.50s -> 6656.02s]  picking Trist for, is to get kills in lane. The problem is, is again what we were just
[6656.02s -> 6659.70s]  talking about, right? Let's say I pick Trist to get kills in lane. Now let's say
[6659.70s -> 6664.94s]  my support doesn't want to be aggressive. And let's say like the Jhin and the Karma
[6664.94s -> 6670.02s]  have a really good push, okay? Something that Trist is really weak at is being
[6670.02s -> 6674.34s]  pushed in right that's one of her weakest things because she has she struggles especially early
[6674.34s -> 6682.10s]  game she struggles quite a bit on farming under turret so let's say it's just like a coin flippy
[6682.10s -> 6688.66s]  pick you could pick trist if you had like a support duo for sure into into jen trist is
[6688.66s -> 6693.62s]  amazing into jen it's one of jen's hardest actual counters but again it's not about
[6693.62s -> 6697.06s]  countering the champion it's about countering the lane and what the lane is going to do to
[6697.06s -> 6699.70s]  to you and being able to play around that.
[6699.70s -> 6701.58s]  And this lane is a shove lane.
[6701.58s -> 6703.14s]  Jin Karma doesn't fight you.
[6703.14s -> 6705.00s]  They poke you and shove waves in.
[6705.00s -> 6705.84s]  That's what they do.
[6705.84s -> 6706.90s]  They're a prio lane.
[6706.90s -> 6709.18s]  So they're just gonna shove and shove and shove, right?
[6709.18s -> 6711.44s]  So because they're just gonna shove and shove and shove,
[6711.44s -> 6713.74s]  I need to play something that isn't gonna have issues
[6713.74s -> 6715.54s]  playing under turret or something that can shove back
[6715.54s -> 6717.66s]  if I need to, right?
[6717.66s -> 6724.16s]  Which is why Jinx, Aphelios are both good.
[6724.16s -> 6725.94s]  Ezreal again, would just get shoved in.
[6725.94s -> 6726.88s]  Stuff like that, right?
[6726.88s -> 6728.24s]  These are things you actually have to think about
[6728.24s -> 6732.64s]  when you're playing the game for certain champions
[6732.64s -> 6734.00s]  and certain matchups.
[6734.00s -> 6735.68s]  Because a lot of the time,
[6735.68s -> 6737.40s]  people will pick a champion that's meta
[6737.40s -> 6738.64s]  and they won't understand
[6738.64s -> 6740.20s]  why they're still losing the matchup,
[6740.20s -> 6742.36s]  even though they're good at that champion.
[6742.36s -> 6744.52s]  And it's just that you're not bad at the champ.
[6744.52s -> 6746.36s]  The matchup is just unplayable.
[6746.36s -> 6749.48s]  You could put Faker, Doublelift,
[6749.48s -> 6751.38s]  fucking Gumiase in certain matchups
[6751.38s -> 6752.40s]  and they will just lose.
[6752.40s -> 6753.72s]  They will lose the matchups.
[6753.72s -> 6756.96s]  And it's because, no matter how good your mechanics are,
[6756.96s -> 6758.18s]  if the matchup is played correctly,
[6758.18s -> 6763.88s]  It doesn't it's not winnable. And that's why you see in pro play drafting is so important
[6763.88s -> 6767.48s]  It's perfect example of why in pro play drafting is ten times more important than solo queue
[6767.48s -> 6770.80s]  And it's because when everybody plays the matchups correctly and shit, right?
[6771.28s -> 6774.69s]  When everybody's playing the matchups correctly and shits
[6775.81s -> 6779.29s]  The matchup like skill becomes a thousand times more important
[6780.37s -> 6786.81s]  Or like, you know how the matchups being played like the champions become way more important. Whoa, what the fuck?
[6787.89s -> 6790.13s]  My monitor just fucked up. What the hell is going on?
[6794.61s -> 6798.73s]  Another little tip for you guys. Oh, I fucked that but another little tip for you guys is
[6801.53s -> 6804.55s]  melee champions or melee minions take
[6810.80s -> 6817.77s]  One turret shot two autos or sorry two turrets shots one auto and casters take one auto one turret shot
[6819.41s -> 6821.91s]  When you're under turrets like walk, okay, so
[6823.19s -> 6826.73s]  Learning this would be actually a pretty game to explain to you how to farm under the turn actually
[6826.73s -> 6830.85s]  I was thinking about like what I could teach you guys because we're just gonna get shoved in a lot this game
[6830.85s -> 6842.68s]  It's actually not that bad though, so right now we could actually space forward here
[6843.92s -> 6859.35s]  Okay, that did not hit me that was BS, but sure I did the same thing I did last game man. I
[6860.69s -> 6862.85s]  Did the same thing you said I walked up
[6863.93s -> 6866.01s]  It wasn't it was a good fight
[6866.01s -> 6872.17s]  But again, I keep doing that we're like I see the fight and I'll take the fight because I know it's a good fight
[6873.01s -> 6879.04s]  But Lulu was too far back. So I ended up just inting. It's really stupid
[6881.47s -> 6899.40s]  like it was such a dumb play by me because I had to blow up both my sums right there because
[6900.96s -> 6905.24s]  The Jin or I mean the Jin was in a really bad spot and the Karma was in a really bad spot because I was
[6905.24s -> 6908.00s]  Level three and they were level two and they were walking up to contest waves
[6908.84s -> 6909.90s]  but
[6909.90s -> 6916.62s]  My Lulu was behind me and when you're playing, you know solo queue you have to play as a team with your teammate
[6917.38s -> 6919.38s]  Okay, so this Jin is kind of griefing right now
[6925.70s -> 6936.66s]  He's griefing by like walking up when I'm blue gunning him. I don't know what Lulu is doing. I was killing that guy
[6936.66s -> 6940.70s]  Nice. Yeah, they're they're grieving really hard. So the blue guns OP for what you just saw
[6941.26s -> 6945.68s]  All you have to do with the blue gun if you really want to just like have a funny ass overpowered fucking
[6947.02s -> 6958.99s]  When they're farming under the turret like that just hit the minions. Okay, we're getting ganks
[6960.35s -> 6961.75s]  Back up
[6961.75s -> 6973.64s]  So I kind of did a cardinal sin there I would say like a sin of like I overstayed a bit I think oh
[6975.56s -> 6977.56s]  Okay, well fuck off dude
[6978.62s -> 6980.94s]  That was greedy I should have backed out the turret
[6980.94s -> 6985.38s]  But I didn't think karma was actually knew that but I did overstay because you can see like this is the perfect example
[6985.38s -> 6987.94s]  Of why I overstayed so they stopped my back, right? I
[6988.90s -> 6991.50s]  Can give you guys a really good example of what just happens. I
[6991.50s -> 6996.30s]  I overstayed and when I overstayed I didn't actually get anything out of it
[6996.46s -> 6999.62s]  Like I got what you saw I just have extra gold for nothing
[6999.74s -> 7004.66s]  So now I just have extra gold right and because I have extra gold the gin actually gets a net positive
[7004.78s -> 7007.78s]  Because they stopped my back so he gets a free plate here
[7007.78s -> 7012.94s]  I miss a cannon and even though I'm still up 10 CS. It's like I could have been up 10 CS
[7013.30s -> 7018.26s]  Not given a plate and not missed a cannon. So it's it's basically like
[7018.26s -> 7023.14s]  Like, it's interesting.
[7023.14s -> 7025.14s]  Should you get Pryo for your jungler every game?
[7025.14s -> 7026.14s]  No.
[7026.14s -> 7029.92s]  No, that's not important.
[7029.92s -> 7031.72s]  Some games, Pryo is important.
[7031.72s -> 7034.06s]  It's very important in some games.
[7034.06s -> 7038.04s]  But you don't need to always be thinking about getting Pryo for your jungler.
[7038.04s -> 7040.76s]  That's not something you should be thinking about like always, right?
[7040.76s -> 7043.60s]  You think about it in terms of timers.
[7043.60s -> 7049.40s]  That's important, but Pryo for jungler always is not something you should be worrying
[7049.40s -> 7054.90s]  about.
[7054.90s -> 7058.92s]  If you're perma shoving and you're like, oh I have prior for my jungler, but then your jungler doesn't do anything
[7059.78s -> 7068.31s]  Like having that prior if you don't have prior it doesn't do anything like I'd rather hold the wave in like a certain spot. Oh
[7069.65s -> 7106.20s]  My god, I suck. I mean it worked out. I think if I was six I triple kill them there
[7107.02s -> 7109.02s]  but I
[7109.02s -> 7110.90s]  think we actually
[7110.90s -> 7114.02s]  Almost I think we actually triple kill them too if Lulu helped me. But again
[7114.74s -> 7161.88s]  You guys know what I'm gonna say I go back to the thing. I don't know if Rengar has ulti or not
[7161.88s -> 7167.69s]  I want to shove this because
[7168.85s -> 7185.89s]  Chill I want to shove it in for a second and I really don't have anything to do
[7185.89s -> 7188.93s]  So I'll just stand here. You want to also be back backed
[7189.73s -> 7193.97s]  What's the tip for when they buy boots? I bought boots. I felt as you can buy boots really early
[7193.97s -> 7200.09s]  He's like he's a champion where the more attacks you do is actually very valuable and positioning on a failure
[7200.09s -> 7202.09s]  So it's very important. It's kind of like
[7202.81s -> 7207.43s]  Some ad carries like you don't need boots really early like like with like Jinx for example
[7207.43s -> 7213.57s]  I usually go free boots, right or I go boots like after my Kraken but with a Phelios
[7214.45s -> 7219.17s]  I really like the early mobility the early trading stuff like that's
[7224.43s -> 7227.93s]  Okay, so always be watching the map too. We see the Rengar's top, right?
[7228.43s -> 7230.97s]  We can actually just straight fight these guys to be two right now
[7230.97s -> 7245.75s]  uh what wait what what's my Lulu doing homie what what are we he's ulting us
[7256.97s -> 7271.42s]  so you're saying helping the ad carry is bad got it I can't believe my Lulu just walked away from me
[7272.54s -> 7279.50s]  and just like watched like you work as a team this is something that I cannot stress enough
[7279.50s -> 7288.27s]  Play as a team when you play League of Legends. This tilts me more than anything
[7288.27s -> 7293.75s]  because this happens even in Grandmaster. I see teammates who will be selfish and
[7293.75s -> 7300.39s]  not help each other. Just help each other. Help each other. Please, man. We
[7300.39s -> 7311.01s]  are a team. Don't just run and leave your ADC. Like I'm not even flaming you
[7311.01s -> 7313.01s]  But like dude, you can't do that
[7313.33s -> 7317.57s]  You can't be upset that like like I can't dodge every spell
[7317.57s -> 7322.37s]  Well, right into the league I feel like something that I noticed that happens a lot in league notice
[7322.37s -> 7325.29s]  Hope you're doing will have this weirdly high
[7325.87s -> 7329.61s]  expectation for everyone to play absolutely perfect at all times and
[7330.69s -> 7337.05s]  And they want me to like be goomy Ossie and I'm like dude. I dodged two of the gin bullets
[7337.05s -> 7339.05s]  I dodged a karma queue
[7339.05s -> 7344.21s]  Like you literally like I can't dodge literally everything while slowed right? Like that's not how it works
[7344.97s -> 7355.36s]  Like dude, I'm gonna lose my mind with this guy
[7356.30s -> 7386.87s]  my Lulu is
[7387.19s -> 7397.44s]  Blaming me. It's okay. It's okay. I don't need to be upset
[7398.32s -> 7400.00s]  It's fine
[7400.00s -> 7402.00s]  the Lulu player
[7402.48s -> 7404.48s]  Is totally okay
[7404.48s -> 7411.10s]  You know, sometimes people think they're right
[7411.94s -> 7413.58s]  It's just
[7413.58s -> 7416.22s]  What happens in the world?
[7423.85s -> 7428.19s]  Right. It's just it is what it is. No big deal
[7441.94s -> 7447.42s]  Sorry, I'm trying really hard to not be an asshole right now. This Lulu player is making me like
[7448.22s -> 7452.14s]  Making me one of like fun Thanos. You know what I mean? Like this guy is like making me
[7453.26s -> 7458.82s]  Like this guy like we talk about we like in league we talk about like the players
[7458.82s -> 7459.82s]  players.
[7459.82s -> 7463.14s]  Wait, we talk about ad carry players having ego.
[7463.14s -> 7470.10s]  I genuinely think support players have five times the ego ad carry players have, but with
[7470.10s -> 7475.50s]  like a third of the skill.
[7475.50s -> 7480.62s]  I think ad carry players do have massive egos.
[7480.62s -> 7485.88s]  But again, I don't think that like, I think support players are genuinely the dumbest
[7485.88s -> 7488.38s]  motherfucking humans on the planet.
[7488.38s -> 7491.66s]  And they think that they're the best players to ever touch the game.
[7491.66s -> 7524.00s]  it hurts my fucking balls. Hey Lulu, would you be willing to have a VOD review with me
[7524.00s -> 7529.22s]  in Discord after the game? Let's just see. I want to see if like this person is willing
[7529.22s -> 7561.33s]  to listen to reason. Let's see. I'm trying to not tilt, but it's really frustrating
[7561.33s -> 7567.01s]  this player is playing specifically for KDA and they're playing like they don't
[7567.01s -> 7571.29s]  understand how like I can already tell you if I go look at this person's op.gg
[7571.29s -> 7576.57s]  they only play for KDA I can tell you right now right here this person plays
[7576.57s -> 7581.89s]  only for KDA never takes any risks doesn't ever help their AD carry ever
[7581.89s -> 7585.93s]  when they get behind doesn't ever walk up to like try and fight doesn't do
[7585.93s -> 7588.89s]  any of that I can tell you right now without even looking at their op.gg
[7588.89s -> 7593.65s]  From how this person plays that they have high KDA is but really low win rate
[7594.05s -> 7600.74s]  But I don't want my entire stream to be me bitching about this Lulu
[7600.74s -> 7602.74s]  So we'll try and focus on how to win from this position
[7603.38s -> 7607.68s]  So I'm sure you guys get shitty supports too. So we'll try and focus on how to win from the current position
[7607.68s -> 7621.03s]  We're in yeah, it doesn't get better
[7621.03s -> 7626.85s]  I mean, I'll be honest with you my grandmaster supports on my main suck like it doesn't get better
[7627.25s -> 7633.05s]  They get better like mechanically at the game, right? Like the higher elo supports get better mechanically
[7633.05s -> 7636.37s]  But they get worse. They don't get better when like
[7637.25s -> 7641.69s]  It doesn't get better. It's always like you'll either have a really good support or you have somebody who sniffs glue
[7642.09s -> 7654.13s]  I'm just dead or I'm not dead
[7676.68s -> 7680.92s]  Honestly our biggest issue here is I need to get blood thirster ASAP
[7681.48s -> 7683.48s]  Once I get BT the game gets a lot easier
[7692.22s -> 7694.22s]  We could kill this guy right now
[7694.42s -> 7697.14s]  If the Lulu helps me we can actually just straight kill these guys
[7697.14s -> 7703.34s]  Because I can ulti to heal myself, right? We have Lulu ult, I have ult to heal myself, and I'm strong
[7704.46s -> 7707.66s]  She has ignite. I have ult. I have everything. We could easily
[7709.54s -> 7711.66s]  Kill that that Taliyah right there.
[7713.46s -> 7716.74s]  I mean, yeah, whatever man. This is what I'm talking about
[7721.26s -> 7722.74s]  again
[7722.74s -> 7726.94s]  Are you willing to get into discord and Vod review?
[7726.94s -> 7742.86s]  Yes or no? I mean, I have to be honest with you. The reason this is frustrating is because
[7742.86s -> 7748.58s]  as an ADC player, you want to be able to rely on your support, right? You want to be able
[7748.58s -> 7753.58s]  to make plays, go in, fight and rely on your teammates because as an ADC player, support
[7753.58s -> 7758.74s]  and AD are like a duo, right? Like you want to play together. No, no, man. I'm
[7758.74s -> 7760.70s]  I'm not attacking you.
[7760.70s -> 7763.40s]  I'm saying, let's discord after.
[7764.60s -> 7775.90s]  You can explain your POV and I'll explain mine.
[7775.90s -> 7777.82s]  Maybe we can like improve this player.
[7778.78s -> 7780.46s]  Like get them to be a better player
[7780.46s -> 7784.44s]  and not ruin every game they play in.
[7784.44s -> 7791.16s]  Like that would be the goat.
[7791.16s -> 7792.94s]  Like that did not hit me by the way,
[7792.94s -> 7794.24s]  that hitbox was BS.
[7794.24s -> 7806.06s]  But I don't even understand.
[7810.18s -> 7817.06s]  Oh man.
[7817.06s -> 7824.03s]  This is the person's, by the way, this is the person's OP.GG.
[7825.11s -> 7828.45s]  Average win rate, 50% win rate, like I said,
[7828.45s -> 7830.79s]  has really good KDAs on all his champs,
[7832.07s -> 7835.09s]  but he doesn't win.
[7835.09s -> 7837.07s]  I'm telling you right now,
[7837.07s -> 7839.07s]  the biggest thing in League,
[7839.07s -> 7841.97s]  the fakest thing in League of Legends
[7841.97s -> 7844.93s]  is believing that you are a good player based on KDA.
[7846.49s -> 7848.91s]  If I go look at any challenger level support player
[7848.91s -> 7856.23s]  right now. Their KDAs will be like four. They'll still have good KDA, but it'll be like four
[7856.23s -> 7864.23s]  and three. And it'll be on that's your mutual. I'm gonna be real with you right now T. This
[7864.23s -> 7870.49s]  Lulu player, like I you could tell me that this person sniffed glue as a kid and their
[7870.49s -> 7874.91s]  parents never told them to stop. And I would believe you. I'm not even meaning like
[7874.91s -> 7876.91s]  I would say that makes sense I
[7877.35s -> 7879.27s]  Mean I said I don't even care
[7879.27s -> 7882.91s]  I don't care if it's a girl a guy the e-girl thing is like that doesn't bother me, right?
[7882.91s -> 7887.51s]  Like like it could be a girl a guy a pigeon they could they could fucking they could
[7888.07s -> 7892.95s]  Relate as a fucking peanut in a in a fucking plane. I don't care about that at all
[7893.35s -> 7898.09s]  You don't mean like say that shit doesn't bother me at all
[7899.21s -> 7903.53s]  Like then be like I actually think it's stupid when people are like, oh, it's an e-girl e-guy
[7903.53s -> 7907.69s]  Like I I think that's dumb as shit because that arguments so crap
[7908.25s -> 7910.25s]  Because like I don't give a shit if it's a guy or girl
[7910.49s -> 7915.05s]  Because like you know what? I mean, I'm more upset at the fact that this person is delusional than anything
[7915.85s -> 7929.96s]  That's like what's tilting me here. I'm just gonna mute
[7930.60s -> 7935.46s]  We'll do one more game on this account after this game and I'm gonna mute from the start of the game for you guys
[7935.46s -> 7942.34s]  Okay
[7942.34s -> 7945.26s]  Dude, if he didn't actually get me into the wall there
[7945.26s -> 7949.14s]  I tried to walk forward so that I wouldn't get condemned in the wall if he didn't stun me
[7949.14s -> 7971.51s]  kill him. Ah, that's annoying. That was actually such a good hitbox for him. My bad. Nice. Huge
[7971.51s -> 7975.27s]  shutdown. Nice job. If you're wondering why I'm even here, by the way, I'm actually, I'm not
[7975.27s -> 7979.83s]  trolling. I'm trying to get this turret because this gives me a lot of gold. At the moment,
[7979.83s -> 7983.75s]  I'm not actually worth that much gold. There's nothing going on on the map. There's no objective
[7983.75s -> 7987.51s]  or anything like that, right? So I'm trying to push in top waves right now so that I can get
[7987.51s -> 7993.69s]  gold to try and like hyper inflate my two item before this next dragon because this
[7993.69s -> 7998.67s]  next dragon is going to be incredibly important if we if we want any chance to win we have
[7998.67s -> 8003.27s]  to win this next dragon and the only way for me to do that is to either get really
[8003.27s -> 8009.79s]  lucky or go get some gold in a side win it's just support difference every game
[8009.79s -> 8016.13s]  it is i want to point this out this person is playing this victim complex bullshit like
[8016.13s -> 8018.37s]  You know what I mean, but it is it is actually support death
[8055.09s -> 8057.25s]  Sorry, I'm tilted. I'm playing bad this game. I
[8058.73s -> 8061.71s]  Need to mute these players because these players are actually tilting me
[8063.13s -> 8066.87s]  Like I was fine with it before but I'm actually getting a little irritated that's making me play bad
[8067.69s -> 8070.01s]  So I need to mute them so I don't keep inting
[8072.15s -> 8074.77s]  Like it's affecting my gameplay and it's too. It's pissing me off
[8076.95s -> 8085.75s]  That's just my bad
[8085.75s -> 8087.75s]  T split. Are you here T?
[8087.75s -> 8091.71s]  Yo T, message this Lulu.
[8091.71s -> 8095.47s]  I mean this in the nicest way, I don't even want to be toxic.
[8095.47s -> 8101.33s]  I genuinely want to use this for content.
[8101.33s -> 8103.65s]  Like this guy's been flaming me the whole game.
[8103.65s -> 8108.41s]  Like I want to use this for content to show you guys that it is so easy to tell people
[8108.41s -> 8110.41s]  how the game should be played.
[8110.41s -> 8117.23s]  So easy if you can communicate by talking.
[8117.23s -> 8119.99s]  Because this guy's been doing nothing but flaming me the entire game.
[8119.99s -> 8121.05s]  This Lulu right?
[8121.05s -> 8127.53s]  He's an absolute like he played the lane completely bad. Then he gave then he stopped trying to win
[8128.41s -> 8131.37s]  Stop shielding me stop doing anything right after he played the lane bad
[8133.79s -> 8138.03s]  Then he started playing the victim thing when I asked him to be a human and like come over and like help me and play
[8138.03s -> 8140.59s]  Teamwork, you gotta remember I didn't flame him a single time
[8141.23s -> 8144.67s]  Right, like I didn't say a single negative thing to this guy in game. I said let's work as a team
[8145.47s -> 8150.73s]  He got upset
[8150.73s -> 8155.29s]  like I genuinely think it'd be great content if I could talk to this guy in discord and just like
[8155.85s -> 8173.84s]  Oh, it'd be so good
[8173.84s -> 8176.96s]  Right, dude. Um, i'm trying to kill these people guys
[8179.42s -> 8181.42s]  That wasn't bad though. We got 800 gold
[8181.98s -> 8184.30s]  Not the worst, but I don't know if my team can stall this
[8185.34s -> 8187.34s]  maybe if they can like kill this they can stall it but
[8191.80s -> 8195.88s]  Nah, they're yeah, that's that's gg. That was a disgusting tallia w
[8234.16s -> 8238.08s]  All right, i'm gonna add him and he'll probably not add me but i'm I might as well try
[8241.07s -> 8243.07s]  This would be such a good learning experience
[8252.11s -> 8253.47s]  Oh, excuse me
[8253.47s -> 8256.67s]  Dude i've had like bad heartburn today. I need to take one of those heartburn pills
[8262.49s -> 8265.53s]  What lulu what man just say just let it out
[8266.33s -> 8269.85s]  Let it out
[8269.85s -> 8271.37s]  Let it out, baby
[8271.37s -> 8272.81s]  yo
[8272.81s -> 8275.32s]  Lulu
[8275.32s -> 8277.32s]  Let's just just have a talk
[8280.17s -> 8281.37s]  yo
[8281.37s -> 8283.37s]  Let's discord
[8283.61s -> 8285.61s]  We can bother of you
[8286.01s -> 8288.01s]  Since i'm so bad
[8290.91s -> 8297.55s]  yo
[8297.55s -> 8302.67s]  trust
[8302.67s -> 8304.67s]  You you just
[8304.67s -> 8315.28s]  Blamed everyone but yourself, but you didn't play correctly at all.
[8315.28s -> 8327.30s]  You played lane completely wrong, didn't help each other, left people to die on repeats,
[8327.30s -> 8338.85s]  then played victim.
[8338.85s -> 8366.34s]  I genuinely want to help you.
[8366.34s -> 8382.86s]  This guy screenshotted what I just said and put it in the end game chat.
[8382.86s -> 8385.34s]  What is happening right now?
[8385.34s -> 8388.50s]  What is going on?
[8388.50s -> 8400.18s]  There is no way that this is not an NPC.
[8400.18s -> 8404.78s]  There is no way this is not an NPC.
[8404.78s -> 8407.86s]  There's no way.
[8407.86s -> 8423.56s]  no way it's Geronimo Lamau it is me yes bro just come talk in discord i'm not even gonna flame you
[8430.05s -> 8442.02s]  what does this even mean bro i don't think i've seen anybody more insecure in my life bro you are
[8442.02s -> 8457.83s]  so insecure. It's cringe how insecure you are. Like oof. Good luck man on the climb to masters but
[8459.51s -> 8472.20s]  Jesus Christ that's sad. Oh god I dude I don't even know what to say like I'm gonna be real
[8472.84s -> 8478.28s]  I was like I'm not even gonna flame the guy right? I just genuinely want to like improve
[8478.28s -> 8483.92s]  the community because that was three straight supports in a row they didn't
[8483.92s -> 8488.36s]  know how to play Lulu and I'm not even gonna flame the guy's skill he's not a
[8488.36s -> 8492.96s]  Lulu player right he doesn't play Lulu that's fine but the issue was that I
[8492.96s -> 8497.44s]  had with that guy specifically was that it's okay to be bad at the game
[8497.44s -> 8501.60s]  right there's nothing wrong with being bad at League everybody has bad games
[8501.60s -> 8505.16s]  but when we're playing a game together and you're saying it's winnable
[8505.16s -> 8512.16s]  and you want to win the game, you can't pick and choose who to like help win the game.
[8512.16s -> 8516.96s]  Like if I'm sitting there bot lane, we're both being dove by Jhin and you're intentionally
[8516.96s -> 8523.04s]  trying not to take damage and not die because you want to value your KDA over everything
[8523.04s -> 8524.28s]  else.
[8524.28s -> 8528.64s]  So that I, you know what, hold on, let me think about this.
[8528.64s -> 8531.96s]  I think I figured this person out.
[8531.96s -> 8534.72s]  This person lives in delusion and I think I figured this out.
[8534.72s -> 8539.12s]  Let me explain this a lot of players do this, but I think I'm figuring this out as I'm as I'm thinking about this
[8539.84s -> 8541.84s]  so
[8541.88s -> 8546.10s]  This person has really good KDAs on their profile right this like this eye-catching person
[8546.10s -> 8548.28s]  They've really really good KDAs on the profile, right?
[8549.04s -> 8553.28s]  This person doesn't ever take risks doesn't ever do anything
[8553.88s -> 8558.12s]  to try and win the game outside of like just existing and hitting buttons and
[8560.78s -> 8564.10s]  what they do is they will always have good KDAs and
[8564.10s -> 8567.74s]  And they will they will sit here and never like I know why they're losing
[8568.18s -> 8573.30s]  They will sit here and they will do this shit where they have good KDAs. They they don't ever die that much blah blah blah
[8573.86s -> 8578.58s]  But what they do is they lie to themselves and they say look how good my KDAs are
[8579.06s -> 8585.46s]  If I had better teammates, I'd always win like I
[8586.26s -> 8588.26s]  Cracked the code actually
[8588.66s -> 8596.46s]  That's totally what it is. The players actually like play so safe and they play to like for statistics, right?
[8596.82s -> 8603.14s]  They play like purely for the stats and then they can say that it was their team's fault that they didn't win
[8603.62s -> 8605.30s]  Because they played
[8605.30s -> 8607.38s]  Really bad, but they didn't die
[8612.40s -> 8616.88s]  Because I mean in theory I could have a perfect kda on every 80 carry I play
[8617.60s -> 8623.36s]  Right. All i'd have to do is literally walk walk up get one kill and then afk and stand in the base the rest of
[8623.36s -> 8628.12s]  The game and I could be like yo, why's my team not able to carry what's happening?
[8631.43s -> 8632.23s]  Right
[8632.23s -> 8636.47s]  Like you could literally do that. No, I seriously think the person's self gaslighting himself
[8637.91s -> 8643.27s]  Like i'm i'm serious. I think this person's like self gaslighting where they they're like, oh it's my team's fault every game
[8643.75s -> 8649.35s]  Right, like they're always blaming their team for their their their loses and their mistakes and shits and it's sad because like
[8650.15s -> 8651.59s]  There's a reason you're d2
[8651.59s -> 8655.35s]  And i'm not saying that to be toxic i'm saying that like you haven't improved in four years
[8655.75s -> 8659.35s]  And you haven't improved because all you're doing is playing to blame your team every single game
[8659.35s -> 8664.35s]  When I just saw like 500 mistakes that you made that we could have won the game off of early game
[8664.75s -> 8676.52s]  Here, I remember somebody wanted me to play a Caitlyn game last game. So we're gonna play Kate. I
[8677.48s -> 8682.92s]  Don't remember. I don't remember who it was in the chat. Somebody's like two people said Kate, but we'll do a cake game for you guys
[8682.92s -> 8684.16s]  I
[8684.16s -> 8703.89s]  Got you boys. Don't worry. All right, I'm gonna take
[8704.69s -> 8710.37s]  Ghost flash because they have three melee champs for my like champs. They have for cons ed clad Gregus
[8710.37s -> 8712.37s]  I'm gonna take ghost flash
[8713.09s -> 8718.11s]  These are gonna be my runes this game. I'm gonna take a little more MR because I don't think we're gonna be fighting too much in lane
[8718.31s -> 8721.47s]  We're pretty much just gonna be poking them with Karma Kate
[8722.15s -> 8726.03s]  So I'm gonna take a little bit extra MR because I'm gonna be playing for mid to late game. I'm just scaling
[8727.51s -> 8737.03s]  And these are gonna be the runes that I take
[8737.11s -> 8739.61s]  Even class on ad carry or the easier to play ones
[8740.19s -> 8745.19s]  In ad carry, I usually do like when I'm playing on this account right now. This is like my teaching accounts
[8745.91s -> 8750.01s]  It's a little lower MMR, right? It's like D1 low masters. I usually
[8750.61s -> 8756.75s]  Play 80 carries that like the chat wants to see me play so that you guys can learn like good and bad matchups and things
[8756.75s -> 8758.53s]  like that's
[8758.53s -> 8762.73s]  The last two games I got way too tilted by shitty support players
[8763.17s -> 8768.17s]  Like egos and all that shit. I got way too frustrated and I played bad the last two games. So we're gonna
[8769.09s -> 8771.69s]  Honestly, I'm just gonna I think I'm just gonna mute these people at the very start of the game
[8772.49s -> 8777.33s]  Normally, I wouldn't suggest you meet people because like playing as a team is really important
[8777.33s -> 8782.11s]  Because like, you know, you need to communicate and all that shit, but I am just like I'm gonna mute them
[8783.73s -> 8785.73s]  Cuz I
[8785.75s -> 8789.89s]  Dude my mental is taking a fucking hit right now. So we're gonna just chill and play I
[8793.59s -> 8798.55s]  Just don't know how to play Nila. I think that was really good. I just don't I don't know how to play her. I
[8799.99s -> 8806.44s]  Think she's a great champ like I've been getting shit on by Nila on my main account
[8806.44s -> 8820.16s]  Like, a lot of Grandmaster Nyla's have been dumpstering me.
[8820.16s -> 8824.00s]  I think she's just really good at abusing solo queue.
[8824.00s -> 8829.68s]  Like the issue with Nyla is, from what I've seen, all the losses I've had with Nyla,
[8829.68s -> 8833.52s]  people don't, um, it's like the thing I was telling you about before, people don't
[8833.52s -> 8838.52s]  play aggressively in the lower elos, like, even in Grandmaster, people don't play like
[8838.52s -> 8842.10s]  aggressively enough, it sounds crazy to say that but it's true, they don't play
[8842.10s -> 8848.18s]  Aggressively enough in lane so you can get away with just picking naila and scaling and naila at like one item
[8848.18s -> 8850.62s]  You'll always be up in levels right because that's how the champion works
[8852.06s -> 8855.34s]  The champion works in like you'll always be up in levels because of her passive
[8855.34s -> 8862.72s]  So you basically just like scale through existing. It's pretty it's pretty interesting
[8864.14s -> 8870.29s]  All right, so we're playing Kate karma. Oh, I missed the minion because I suck
[8871.39s -> 8873.39s]  I'm gonna ward this bush
[8873.39s -> 8883.94s]  Just because I don't want the Rakan in the bush.
[8883.94s -> 8888.36s]  So now that the bush isn't warded anymore, okay he warded it nice, I was gonna say what
[8888.36s -> 8893.58s]  I want to do is I actually want to play, oh I suck.
[8893.58s -> 8896.06s]  I actually wanted to play, oh man I'm so bad at Cait.
[8896.06s -> 8900.22s]  I wanted to play on the top side of the wave so that I'm not standing near the bushes
[8900.22s -> 8901.46s]  right?
[8901.46s -> 8905.70s]  Because if you stand near the bushes, the Rakan can obviously like W me and I just
[8905.70s -> 8906.70s]  get fucked so.
[8906.70s -> 8908.74s]  I'd rather play in a safer spot.
[8909.46s -> 8911.46s]  Can't believe I missed two CS. I'm so fucking bad
[8912.34s -> 8916.62s]  Now I want to push in wave three and I want to go buy a cull. So I'm gonna ping to push
[8925.36s -> 8927.00s]  Okay
[8927.00s -> 8931.80s]  So I actually want to back here and I'm gonna go buy a cull. So this is called a cheater recall
[8933.28s -> 8937.10s]  You usually have perfect CS to back on this timer
[8937.84s -> 8939.84s]  Go and you can go buy a cull. Okay
[8940.32s -> 8944.34s]  This is like something that you can do if you're in a lane that's gonna be perma shoving
[8944.34s -> 8951.28s]  So what happens is the reason it's called the cheetah recall is because we push the wave in they had to stay and farm the wave
[8951.56s -> 8953.56s]  Right now watch
[8953.64s -> 8960.99s]  They have to push this wave in right now if karma was here instead of roaming this Rome's fine
[8960.99s -> 8964.03s]  By the way, but if she was here instead of roaming she could actually hold the wave
[8965.17s -> 8976.09s]  And if you notice here, I don't actually miss that many minions, right? We're chilling now. We can slow push this
[8976.17s -> 8978.91s]  We're safe. I should actually fast push this
[8978.91s -> 8987.91s]  Because I want it to bounce I don't want to slow push this but I can't I can't fast push this at level 3 by myself
[8987.91s -> 8993.91s]  So we're just gonna chill
[8993.91s -> 9000.91s]  Kaylyn's really good at abusing like early lane phase bullying just based on like what our kit does
[9000.91s -> 9003.91s]  We see Rakan on the map top side you see that
[9003.91s -> 9011.29s]  So because we see Rakan I can walk up a bit and we can play a little aggro here
[9011.53s -> 9022.24s]  You can kind of see like I don't have to play behind the minion wave. You see what I'm doing to this guy, right?
[9022.24s -> 9023.52s]  I
[9023.52s -> 9034.09s]  Hate this game. We can quit we can forfeit. It's fine. I hate this game. I really hate this game
[9034.77s -> 9042.48s]  Dude, what is wrong with me right now? It's like my brain doesn't work. It's the 280 Kate nerf telling you
[9042.90s -> 9049.32s]  So we're cons gonna be bought right now. I
[9050.74s -> 9052.50s]  Know he's gonna be bought
[9052.50s -> 9054.50s]  So I need to be a little care
[9054.74s -> 9056.74s]  Now my karma is here
[9058.99s -> 9062.35s]  There we go. So, you know, so I didn't use any spells. I'm not I'm just chillin
[9065.54s -> 9066.90s]  Dude
[9066.90s -> 9068.90s]  Are you kidding me, man?
[9068.94s -> 9076.42s]  I'm gonna be honest. I'm getting really tilted by these players now like the Rakan W's in
[9077.08s -> 9080.00s]  They just stand there and watch me die
[9081.44s -> 9084.48s]  Okay, it's fine. Listen, I'm not gonna get too mad about it. It's fine
[9084.48s -> 9085.56s]  I should have flashed the knockup
[9085.56s -> 9089.16s]  I guess even though in reality I should never have to flash the knockup
[9089.16s -> 9094.98s]  But I should have flashed it because I can't trust the teammates. So what I'm saying is right there karma and fiddle
[9094.98s -> 9099.72s]  We're both right here. I was being chased down. They stood here. They didn't they didn't walk up to do anything
[9099.96s -> 9101.96s]  They just stood and waited
[9102.60s -> 9105.32s]  That pisses me off because I hate when players
[9106.40s -> 9108.40s]  play
[9108.40s -> 9115.41s]  Selfish and scared. It's my biggest pet peeve. It drives me fucking crazy, man
[9116.69s -> 9123.92s]  Sorry, I'm getting I'm losing my minds like it's so easy
[9126.42s -> 9129.70s]  It's fine though. I I shouldn't have walked up and ego'd it. It's on me
[9141.26s -> 9148.79s]  I want to still push this wave
[9148.79s -> 9154.55s]  Yeah, i'm losing it
[9154.55s -> 9157.99s]  This by the way would be an example of a bad time for karma to roam. She needs to come back bot
[9162.10s -> 9164.26s]  There's absolutely no reason for her to roam on that timer
[9165.22s -> 9168.50s]  There's also no reason for her to be in that bush over there. We should be playing up to try
[9168.74s -> 9170.42s]  We're playing kate karma, right?
[9170.42s -> 9172.74s]  We should be playing forward so that we can actually be aggressive
[9173.86s -> 9176.82s]  Kate karma is a lane bully lane. We don't want to sit here and just do nothing
[9176.82s -> 9181.34s]  If you pick karma you want to be aggressive you want to be playing up you want to be stunning you want to be doing
[9181.34s -> 9189.01s]  Like aggressive things playing the game. We're level six. I'd really like to like go in. Yeah, like
[9196.73s -> 9201.45s]  That was actually not bad by the karma. She w'd the Zaya and then I got to trap off of it
[9201.45s -> 9203.33s]  So that wasn't too bad
[9203.33s -> 9219.38s]  Not the worst
[9219.38s -> 9224.26s]  Not not bad. That was good. That was good
[9225.46s -> 9228.98s]  Really nice really nice. Okay, so I'm gonna back here cuz I don't want to overstay for the wave
[9229.38s -> 9244.79s]  I'm gonna grab boots
[9244.79s -> 9250.74s]  You know what I think a lot of it is, too?
[9250.74s -> 9254.46s]  I think a lot of it is people get really scared when they- like Rakan is really strong in this
[9254.46s -> 9255.46s]  meta, right?
[9255.46s -> 9256.46s]  Like he's very very powerful.
[9256.46s -> 9259.38s]  He's- his like numbers are a little too high right now, so like everything he does
[9259.38s -> 9261.18s]  is just a little too good.
[9261.18s -> 9264.46s]  So I think people get nervous around Rakan, especially with Xayah, because it's like
[9264.46s -> 9266.74s]  when people would get nervous around Nami-Lucian.
[9266.74s -> 9270.38s]  The lane like plays itself, it's very strong, it's very hard to beat, but you
[9270.38s -> 9272.92s]  can still see people making mistakes when they play the lane, so you gotta watch
[9272.92s -> 9280.41s]  for that type of stuff.
[9280.41s -> 9292.59s]  Now a good way to play against a Xayah once she hits 6 is you don't want to ever walk
[9292.59s -> 9297.15s]  melee range of her or give her the ability to just kill you with the feathers.
[9297.15s -> 9302.73s]  Your main goal here is going to be try and stay in a good spot when it comes to feathers.
[9302.73s -> 9304.85s]  I want to be to the side of her.
[9304.85s -> 9307.85s]  The side of her is the best option, like where she can't pull in, like I'll get
[9307.85s -> 9312.93s]  hit by maybe a few, but she can't pull in all of them.
[9312.93s -> 9317.69s]  a really key thing when playing versus her because I remember back in the day I
[9317.69s -> 9320.09s]  didn't know how to play Versailles and I would always get fucking frustrated this
[9320.09s -> 9326.41s]  shit. So Rakan's 5. I want to hit tab, see Rakan's 5. We shouldn't be able to
[9326.41s -> 9332.55s]  die here. I want to push this wave in but I also need to stay away from
[9332.55s -> 9338.10s]  where the Rakan could be. So if you want to push waves in and reset the
[9338.10s -> 9343.30s]  wave make sure that you're standing as far away as you can from where they
[9343.30s -> 9351.47s]  can engage on you now they're about to be six where Khan is so they have a
[9351.47s -> 9355.03s]  really strong level six she has pickaxe and noon quiver we do want to be a
[9355.03s -> 9360.31s]  little hesitant here we don't want to fight now I'm gonna kind of push this
[9360.31s -> 9364.31s]  in a bit we should have been spam pushing the whole wave because that's
[9364.31s -> 9369.89s]  how Kate Karma plays we just push push push push but we played that that
[9369.89s -> 9376.11s]  early roam by Karma kind of put us behind on that it's not a big deal
[9376.11s -> 9379.33s]  It's just something that we have to adjust
[9382.96s -> 9408.65s]  Why does this say 88 and this say 90? Which one is it? Is it 88 or 90? I mean that guy's dead. I
[9410.05s -> 9412.05s]  Don't know what that karma's thinking but
[9414.60s -> 9422.44s]  We probably have to give this Drake. I mean, maybe we could fight it if fiddle had ulti but
[9423.20s -> 9432.36s]  I'm not having old. Yeah, there's no way the higher one counts ward kills
[9433.42s -> 9435.42s]  why I
[9435.42s -> 9439.08s]  I think that's so stupid. So they might try and engage here
[9440.82s -> 9446.10s]  Unless they somehow know Fiddles in the bush, which would be impressive because we know it's not warded
[9446.58s -> 9472.72s]  So that'd be pretty impressive if they knew that we could actually rift. I'm just gonna ghost
[9476.92s -> 9479.40s]  This is crazy. What the fuck? Oh
[9480.00s -> 9490.18s]  This is interesting. They saw fit 100% Yeah, I don't know where though. It must have because he used this thing
[9490.18s -> 9496.56s]  But I'll use this whatever it's called his effigy
[9497.28s -> 9498.76s]  I'd have to go look
[9498.76s -> 9504.30s]  One million. Oh, I guess I didn't see it. I
[9506.42s -> 9508.42s]  Should back I can get dove here
[9508.58s -> 9512.46s]  We don't know where Greg is is like if Greg is happens to be like he ease over this wall or something
[9512.46s -> 9515.94s]  I think it don't really easy. I'm greeting really hard
[9517.06s -> 9519.06s]  Greeting usually gets you killed
[9519.10s -> 9520.74s]  typically I
[9520.74s -> 9522.22s]  Shouldn't be doing this
[9522.22s -> 9527.50s]  They're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right?
[9528.18s -> 9536.14s]  It's like if you know something's gonna be a bad habit you should not do it just cue the bush
[9537.86s -> 9546.18s]  Okay, that was I meant use like an actual cue they could also be in the alcove so I'm a little hesitant but it's fine
[9552.00s -> 9556.22s]  Okay, so the reason I stayed was because now I have my I have my mythic right?
[9556.94s -> 9561.06s]  Because we finished the coal and we finished the mythic at the same time or finished the wave. So
[9562.74s -> 9564.74s]  Now I have two options I go gale force here
[9565.24s -> 9567.24s]  to dodge a lot of their shits or
[9567.94s -> 9570.18s]  I can do what sounds like a fun option
[9571.78s -> 9573.78s]  We're gonna do shield though
[9574.22s -> 9577.04s]  I'm gonna show you guys why I like shield bow on Caitlyn
[9577.94s -> 9582.42s]  It's not the best mythic, but it's good into certain comps
[9583.46s -> 9585.46s]  If you don't want to get
[9587.50s -> 9589.50s]  Yeah
[9589.62s -> 9594.02s]  Because I have a lack ready this game I don't have bloodline right so I kind of want to go
[9594.02s -> 9604.17s]  shield bow and then I'm gonna end up going either IE or I'm gonna end up
[9604.17s -> 9615.89s]  going like bloodthirster seconds IE or BT probably IE just because I think
[9615.89s -> 9626.16s]  I think it's actually easier to go IE this game but yeah this is a kind of
[9626.16s -> 9637.44s]  boring game our team's done really well though so we just chill we got to
[9637.44s -> 9658.24s]  be a little care okay it was kind of hard to do anything there even though
[9658.24s -> 9662.12s]  I got like a few autos on the gragas. It's a little difficult to actually play the game there
[9662.56s -> 9672.54s]  Because if I walk up too far like see where cons are if I walk up too far, I just get killed by Rakan
[9672.68s -> 9677.05s]  All right. I'm just gonna reset and go get boots
[9679.82s -> 9682.10s]  Typically 80 carry is really fucking boring
[9682.82s -> 9684.82s]  in games like this
[9685.22s -> 9687.18s]  where
[9687.18s -> 9700.50s]  You can't really blow the game open. Oh, I'm dead. Maybe wait karma shield me. I'm not dead. Nice
[9702.48s -> 9724.80s]  Motherfucker Kobe'd me, man. He was like, Kobe.
[9724.80s -> 9728.68s]  We can fight this, though. They have no ults.
[9728.68s -> 9738.09s]  Like, this is actually fightable. They have no Xayah-R and no, uh, Gragas-R.
[9738.09s -> 9746.13s]  And this is also why it's really important that you relay to your team the cooldowns of your team.
[9746.13s -> 9748.13s]  Remember that. Don't forget that.
[9748.13s -> 9751.13s]  If somebody uses a big cooldown, tell your team.
[9751.13s -> 9754.13s]  Because that was an illegal dragon, right? Like, they just...
[9754.13s -> 9757.13s]  That was one of the most illegal things I've seen in a while.
[9757.13s -> 9780.10s]  homie completely griefed that that's another very very very important thing
[9780.10s -> 9783.70s]  that you need to take away from playing league and being like this is what I'm
[9783.70s -> 9788.18s]  saying about the teamwork and shit earlier being good at the game is a lot
[9788.18s -> 9793.22s]  of spreading knowledge as well right like if you if your team doesn't know
[9793.22s -> 9796.90s]  if a flash is up or down you have to play completely differently right like
[9796.90s -> 9798.98s]  you got to think about the game in that in terms of that as well like
[9798.98s -> 9801.98s]  how many times have you seen like you know you're like oh I can walk
[9801.98s -> 9809.03s]  up here if this guy can't flash ult me or something, right? It happens all the time.
[9809.03s -> 9832.10s]  I wonder if I can kill a Duskblade Zed. I don't know. I probably could. Uh, I should go mid.
[9835.27s -> 9842.18s]  What do you think about Teemo and other top lane as AD carry? I play Teemo AD carry when I'm
[9842.18s -> 9857.43s]  playing for fun sometimes. It's okay. Yo, go look on your game, man. So during the mid game
[9857.43s -> 9861.83s]  as Caitlyn, a few things that I can kind of teach you. This was kind of a boring lane phase,
[9861.83s -> 9869.07s]  right like we didn't really do that much the lane phase was essentially just like we died once and then you know everything all hell broke loose
[9869.95s -> 9871.95s]  When you're walking up the fights like this
[9872.47s -> 9874.99s]  Make sure that you're putting traps down in places
[9877.18s -> 9885.02s]  Where the enemy has to walk just like that
[9885.70s -> 9890.06s]  Playing 80 playing Caitlyn is not always about just like autoing and getting cues and shit
[9890.10s -> 9894.00s]  If you noticed during that fight, I put two traps here two traps here
[9894.00s -> 9897.66s]  I forced the enemy team into like a location where they had to eat traps
[9900.25s -> 9908.84s]  or they uh they can't find us right and even if like they avoid the traps they're still having to
[9908.84s -> 9914.36s]  like move their character in a very unique specific way that they probably don't want to do
[9918.31s -> 9921.27s]  so you should always be thinking where should i put these traps down at the start of a fight
[9921.27s -> 9925.83s]  not like how do i get autos off think about using your traps to zone and to like control
[9925.83s -> 9931.75s]  the team fight before the fight starts rather than using it to do damage because they'll
[9931.75s -> 9936.79s]  step in the traps themselves people will just people are stupid they're bad
[9936.79s -> 9941.39s]  people aren't paying attention everything I'm bad you know what I mean
[9941.39s -> 9944.43s]  people can't pay attention to every bush that you're putting traps in during a
[9944.43s -> 9964.82s]  big fight it's it's too much attention span nobody has it nice we'll grab this
[9964.82s -> 9971.85s]  red oh big tip for all the ad carries and chat guys I'm tell you right now
[9971.85s -> 9976.43s]  once the 20-minute mark happens in league your junglers camps are no
[9976.43s -> 9981.53s]  longer his I know I know junglers are gonna hate me for this okay listen if
[9981.53s -> 9984.51s]  you're a jungle player you're like fuck this guy now I hate him listen you know
[9984.51s -> 9989.45s]  it's true you know at 20 minutes your camps no longer like they're not yours
[9989.45s -> 9994.43s]  anymore man okay like you you you are full items at this point okay like I
[9994.43s -> 10001.24s]  want to be honest you would I'm taking your camps I'm trying to get my third
[10001.24s -> 10013.05s]  item as fast as humanly possible because 80 carries spike on three items
[10013.05s -> 10024.49s]  extremely hard. Man, I want to walk top, but we have no vision of this area, so it's a little scary.
[10028.70s -> 10034.70s]  Like I said, I typically don't like to take Jungle's Camp's early game, ever. Because like,
[10035.58s -> 10039.82s]  that's why I say like at 20 minutes, usually you have two items at this point. If you're like
[10039.82s -> 10044.54s]  farming decent and you know, etc. Sometimes it'll be faster, but usually it's around average
[10044.54s -> 10050.49s]  of like you'll have your items at this point. Always be tabbing to the team fights,
[10050.49s -> 10081.20s]  even if you're farming as well. Zed is in this bush. Wait, where is he? Wait, I'm stupid. Where'd
[10081.20s -> 10094.57s]  he go? Oh, he died. I killed him. Wow. I'm really smart. I like didn't notice that I killed that
[10094.57s -> 10109.36s]  guy. I'm so dumb. AD carry brain, right boys? I was like playing that so scared too, because
[10109.36s -> 10124.88s]  I was like, I was like, is he there? Pull the dragon out. Oh, I asked this yesterday,
[10124.88s -> 10128.80s]  But what do you guys think the coolest looking dragon is? I swear it's the uh,
[10130.32s -> 10132.32s]  I think mountain drake looks fucking sick
[10168.88s -> 10171.76s]  Welcome to the here. You saw that I like took the time to push mid, right?
[10172.32s -> 10176.48s]  Jera hyphen, uh, that's mainly because we our karma just got picked off
[10178.76s -> 10183.64s]  And I don't want to give them the option of pushing the wave. So by pushing the lane
[10203.34s -> 10207.50s]  Nice by pushing the the lane in it takes away an option for the enemy
[10208.14s -> 10210.56s]  That's something that a lot of people think like oh, I just want farm
[10210.56s -> 10216.36s]  I don't care about the farm right like when I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game and I'm pushing like a
[10216.86s -> 10220.80s]  Mid mid wave in before a fight if we're just sieging around the Baron
[10222.10s -> 10226.58s]  Having that wave pushed in gives them gives us an another option. I'm like what we can do in the game
[10227.30s -> 10229.62s]  and it takes you three seconds to push it in so
[10230.46s -> 10232.46s]  if the fights already over and
[10233.30s -> 10236.98s]  You have time always be paying attention to like trying to push in waves
[10237.50s -> 10242.80s]  So that you can create a little bit of that pressure. Yo, hail. Thank you so much for the 14 man. Welcome back
[10243.70s -> 10246.18s]  What do I get next? I kind of want to get BT
[10247.02s -> 10251.43s]  I'm gonna get BT. I
[10251.43s -> 10256.39s]  Could get Dom's but I think BT is better because the I already have over here, right?
[10256.39s -> 10261.95s]  So the shield from BT plus shield bow plus ie. I don't think I'll be able to die. Okay, I think I'm unkillable
[10263.31s -> 10265.31s]  Actually, like actually unkillable
[10265.31s -> 10268.71s]  so here I'm gonna actually give these camps the fiddle because he's literally
[10268.71s -> 10288.54s]  pathing to them I don't want to be an asshole but Wow what just happened I'm
[10288.54s -> 10298.74s]  bad I feel like I got hooked by cled oh he flashed okay I was like I feel like
[10298.74s -> 10301.78s]  what just happened was like I mispositioned cuz like I went up here
[10301.78s -> 10304.74s]  right like I ghosted went up here cuz there was two people here two people
[10304.74s -> 10308.30s]  here I put traps down these kind of sloppy traps and then I positioned
[10308.30s -> 10316.60s]  here and then cled flash queued me under the yeah okay that makes sense i'm just bad it was okay
[10316.60s -> 10326.99s]  though because if the entire enemy team has to literally like double flash on you to kill you
[10326.99s -> 10331.71s]  under the turret and then your team follows up it's not that big of a deal gale force would have
[10331.71s -> 10343.00s]  saved me there though actually lowkey gale force totally would save me because he has serpents
[10345.67s -> 10350.49s]  Serpents definitely shits on chill bow. I'm kind of stupid for going show by this game. I
[10353.05s -> 10357.73s]  Wanted to try it out cuz I when I before when I was playing Caitlin like before the IE rework and everything
[10358.15s -> 10359.79s]  everybody would go
[10359.79s -> 10363.59s]  Or there was like one guy in challenger would go shield bow into shit every game
[10363.79s -> 10368.63s]  And I wanted to see if like it was still viable, but there might just be better options now like always scale force
[10369.71s -> 10376.18s]  BT or something. Oh my god. I flashed late. I'm dead
[10379.05s -> 10383.97s]  Dude I flashed late for some reason. I'm so dumb my bad
[10385.61s -> 10387.29s]  Let's give him an MB
[10387.29s -> 10389.29s]  Like my brain it's moving slowly
[10390.01s -> 10392.01s]  Like I can feel it turning
[10392.69s -> 10394.69s]  I'm just playing bad
[10394.73s -> 10398.33s]  Like I was baiting the Kled to go in on me because Karma was there
[10398.45s -> 10401.17s]  But what I need to do is I need to trap on top myself when he goes in
[10401.73s -> 10404.75s]  Then I need to flash in it and the Kled just dies
[10405.37s -> 10408.94s]  You can also just kill him
[10409.90s -> 10412.46s]  I was gonna say they have nothing
[10413.18s -> 10424.94s]  We just play for dragon here. I don't know why I'm playing so bad today. I played bad yesterday, too
[10424.94s -> 10427.50s]  I don't know what's going on. My like brain is broken
[10444.99s -> 10446.99s]  Dude, there were con was trying so hard
[10459.51s -> 10482.43s]  Oh
[10482.43s -> 10490.37s]  I've made so many mistakes this game. I fucked up positioning mechanics farm
[10491.29s -> 10499.53s]  all kinds of shit, uh
[10499.61s -> 10509.83s]  I still don't want our Dom's actually I don't think Lord Dom's is good this game
[10510.63s -> 10515.11s]  Like they have no armor like quite as work treads
[10516.87s -> 10518.87s]  Which I feel like
[10519.83s -> 10521.83s]  Really bad indoor team but
[10530.94s -> 10533.24s]  Oh a little tip that you guys can have for Caitlin to
[10533.90s -> 10535.90s]  when you are
[10535.98s -> 10537.98s]  Like barons up in 50 seconds, right?
[10537.98s -> 10543.38s]  so a little thing you can do that's actually kind of fun is you want to be at the objective before the like
[10543.70s -> 10548.14s]  Rule with them when an objectives coming up. You always want to be on that side of the map before the before the objective comes
[10548.14s -> 10549.10s]  up
[10549.10s -> 10554.62s]  But you can put down traps in the bushes
[10555.78s -> 10559.38s]  Around the objectives and people will face check them and you can just one tap on my game
[10561.18s -> 10563.18s]  It's actually incredibly fun
[10563.58s -> 10569.56s]  But you just put them in the corners of the bushes where people have to walk
[10570.16s -> 10591.12s]  Like right here. I can put it right between the turret. I don't know why I didn't ghosts
[10591.98s -> 10599.31s]  I'll be honest. I have no idea why I didn't ghosts. I was like saving it for something. I'm not sure what
[10599.31s -> 10605.43s]  but next year, a birthday present, who the fuck knows?
[10609.42s -> 10612.06s]  Oh, I could have one shot that guy if I was better at Kate.
[10613.18s -> 10615.14s]  I did a really classic combo right there.
[10615.14s -> 10618.76s]  I just didn't Q cause I'm bad.
[10618.76s -> 10619.96s]  I should have, when he hit the trap,
[10619.96s -> 10621.88s]  your two headshots sit on him for a few seconds.
[10621.88s -> 10623.80s]  So what I should have done is I should have instantly
[10623.80s -> 10624.64s]  Q'd on top of the trap,
[10624.64s -> 10626.56s]  then auto autoed and he would have died.
[10626.56s -> 10628.72s]  Cause your Q does the max damage when they're trapped too.
[10628.72s -> 10632.18s]  So it would have been like just a perfect three shot.
[10632.18s -> 10634.48s]  But like I said, I don't play Kate enough
[10634.48s -> 10636.48s]  And my muscle memory is kind of trash sometimes, so...
[10637.98s -> 10638.48s]  That was my bad.
[10649.90s -> 10650.90s]  Oh, we're getting cletted.
[10652.30s -> 10653.40s]  I don't know where he is, but...
[10671.26s -> 10672.06s]  I shouldn't have done that.
[10674.95s -> 10677.15s]  I'm limit testing really hard right now.
[10677.35s -> 10678.95s]  I suggest you guys don't limit test.
[10678.95s -> 10680.45s]  Well, actually, I do think you should limit test.
[10680.75s -> 10682.45s]  But not if you want to win, like play safer.
[10682.45s -> 10684.25s]  Like right there, the play wasn't to go back in.
[10684.75s -> 10687.55s]  The play was to like back off, but I wanted to see if I could like...
[10690.40s -> 10692.20s]  I wanted to see if I was terrible or not.
[10693.60s -> 10694.10s]  You know?
[10695.20s -> 10695.80s]  I was.
[10695.90s -> 10702.00s]  But yeah, I mean the combo with Kate is like if they're trapped you want to queue while
[10702.00s -> 10707.54s]  they're in the trap essentially because your auto will always give you the range.
[10707.54s -> 10714.08s]  So if you auto and then queue, when they're trapped they get, not a lot of people know
[10714.08s -> 10721.14s]  this because I just found this out like a few years or like after I should have.
[10721.14s -> 10727.50s]  When you Q on top of a K Trap, the way KSQ works is when you Q, it hits initially and
[10727.50s -> 10730.74s]  then it does less damage to the targets behind it.
[10730.74s -> 10734.10s]  It's very narrow and then it gets bigger.
[10734.10s -> 10739.02s]  When they're trapped though, it does the maximum Q damage that it can do in the isolation
[10739.02s -> 10745.73s]  of the Q. That's why when people are trapped, you want to open up with your Q. You either
[10745.73s -> 10751.45s]  want to net into the queue and then double auto or you want to net or you want to like
[10751.45s -> 10757.01s]  you want to queue then trap net at the same time then double auto you basically it's a
[10757.01s -> 10762.13s]  very interesting way to play you always want to try and overlay a trap on your trap so
[10762.13s -> 10766.93s]  when they get trapped you can overlay a second trap to either in front of them or
[10766.93s -> 10770.85s]  behind them and what will happen is there's actually like a little mini like I want
[10770.85s -> 10775.01s]  to say one second cool down of being able to be trapped right like a little 1.5
[10775.01s -> 10778.63s]  2 second cooldown, but what can happen is they sit in the trap, then what you can do
[10778.63s -> 10784.01s]  is your net can slow them, so you can actually queue in the first trap, then you can drop
[10784.01s -> 10788.09s]  a second trap, net slow them into the second trap, and then triple auto headshot them
[10788.09s -> 10791.17s]  from all three of the two traps.
[10791.17s -> 10805.85s]  It's really complicated sounding, but this man just redeemed end my stream whenever
[10805.85s -> 10812.92s]  you want.
[10812.92s -> 10813.92s]  What?
[10813.92s -> 10817.45s]  Why?
[10817.45s -> 10829.15s]  Why would you want to end my stream right now?
[10829.15s -> 10831.15s]  Why would you want to be that guy?
[10831.15s -> 10839.65s]  Wow. Okay.
[10839.65s -> 10853.86s]  Don't end, just change the camera position.
[10853.86s -> 10863.81s]  Did you just spend one million points to tell me to put the camera back on the right side of my fucking-
[10863.81s -> 10872.06s]  No way.
[10872.06s -> 10874.06s]  No way you just did that.
[10874.06s -> 10880.62s]  I was like, this man is just flexing.
[10880.62s -> 10883.62s]  He's just like, yeah, I got some points to spare.
[10883.62s -> 10885.62s]  Guess I could like throw them, you know, eh
[10889.29s -> 10902.47s]  Alright fine. There's that better
[10903.31s -> 10910.06s]  Is that better?
[10910.06s -> 10917.27s]  Drink water. Actually, that's a good one. I'll be our be I'm gonna get some water. Should we plan our main? I
[10917.87s -> 10919.87s]  Kind of want to try and hit GM
[10919.91s -> 10923.39s]  Yeah, let's get on our main account. It's like 1 p.m. So it's like 3 p.m. Eastern. I
[10924.27s -> 10925.63s]  think I
[10925.63s -> 10927.63s]  Can get cues at the moment?
[10928.15s -> 10934.09s]  Let me get some water and then we'll queue up or we'll kill thing. It's water
[10934.09s -> 10946.46s]  Okay, because I think I think it's late enough than day I can get cues now without waiting 40 minutes
[10946.98s -> 10957.36s]  By the way, it is it is a teaching stream when I'm doing that like 80 carry Academy thing
[10957.36s -> 10960.30s]  So if you guys have any questions you want to ask or like you guys can ignore that
[10960.70s -> 10962.70s]  If you guys have any questions you want to ask or anything like that?
[10963.60s -> 10970.38s]  You know, we're just chilling between games. Just ask whatever you want. I I can answer a lot easier between games that I can in game
[10971.22s -> 10973.08s]  You know, it's a lot easier for me to see that shit
[10973.08s -> 10977.70s]  I try and answer in game, but like sometimes I'm like focusing and shit. So it's a little harder
[10977.78s -> 10988.01s]  I am gonna get some water though. So I'll be right back. Okay
[10989.13s -> 10991.13s]  Talk amongst yourselves
[10991.29s -> 10994.77s]  Is Kraken troll on Kate? No Kraken's gonna Kate
[10995.61s -> 10999.57s]  You can go Kraken into bloodthirster or Kraken in the IE if you really need it if
[11000.37s -> 11002.71s]  If they have like tanks so they have like Sion
[11003.93s -> 11008.87s]  Tsuwani stuff like that. You have to like you're the only damage. Let's say you're like the only tank killer on the team
[11008.87s -> 11011.93s]  You're the only 80 damage you have to go Kraken sometimes
[11074.09s -> 11079.09s]  The best day of my life.
[11079.09s -> 11082.09s]  My life.
[11181.38s -> 11189.50s]  There's a lot of time.
[11189.50s -> 11191.50s]  Yeah.
[11191.50s -> 11197.94s]  But for the
[11197.94s -> 11199.94s]  the
[11199.94s -> 11201.94s]  the
[11201.94s -> 11203.94s]  the
[11203.94s -> 11205.94s]  the
[11205.94s -> 11207.94s]  the
[11207.94s -> 11209.94s]  the
[11209.94s -> 11216.84s]  the
[11216.84s -> 11218.84s]  the
[11218.84s -> 11220.84s]  the
[11220.84s -> 11222.84s]  the
[11222.84s -> 11237.54s]  the
[11237.54s -> 11266.04s]  fuck there we go alright boys what are we playing I don't really care about
[11266.04s -> 11278.88s]  banning you me most of the time but we'll just do it I don't remember what
[11278.88s -> 11282.00s]  we're talking about oh supports yeah they're all stupid
[11282.00s -> 11301.30s]  haha sky oh that's so good that's so good alright what am I playing
[11301.30s -> 11318.98s]  or versus Varus hmm they just play Jinx Melio Jinx Melio pretty pretty
[11318.98s -> 11335.89s]  gross land pretty gross land um kaisa i didn't want to pick kaisa in the varus i could have
[11335.89s -> 11339.81s]  picked kaisa this game but i kind of wanted to pick jinx because milio jinx is really good
[11340.45s -> 11361.84s]  it's like a super super op land somebody dodged okay check this out oh supports yeah they're all
[11361.84s -> 11383.36s]  stupid i mean listen every 80 carries default state of mind listen i'm not wrong i ain't wrong
[11383.36s -> 11388.72s]  I need to see if this guy is the pike player or not
[11390.20s -> 11394.48s]  Before I ban this cuz like I don't want to play verse pike usually pikes are all like one tricks and shit
[11394.48s -> 11396.48s]  I don't want to play verse a pike player
[11397.08s -> 11404.20s]  But I needed to know that my support wasn't the pike player, you know, he doesn't seem to care
[11407.79s -> 11420.92s]  Ashmeleo is really good too. Yeah. No, Ashmeleo is really good sub tragedy
[11421.36s -> 11434.65s]  Did I always have to first pick every game every game? I have to first pick every single one
[11449.14s -> 11451.14s]  You're not liking the camera over there. Oh
[11451.14s -> 11456.68s]  Oh, my bad.
[11456.68s -> 11478.86s]  Can we revert it with points?
[11478.86s -> 11482.16s]  Are you motherfuckers trying to like bid war
[11482.16s -> 11489.20s]  to where my camera is right now?
[11489.20s -> 11490.50s]  Is that what's happening?
[11490.50s -> 11510.17s]  You know what's interesting?
[11510.17s -> 11514.07s]  I don't know what some I want to take here.
[11514.07s -> 11518.89s]  I almost want to take Clintons because they have
[11518.89s -> 11523.19s]  they have Ophelia's Q, Lulu's Slow, Lulu's CC,
[11523.19s -> 11527.39s]  Hecarim's Fear, and Ahri ult, I mean Ahri charm.
[11527.39s -> 11533.71s]  But every single one of those is avoidable if I'm not bad. It's hard to tell
[11535.07s -> 11539.11s]  Cuz like every single one of those things is like avoidable if I'm not trash at the game
[11539.55s -> 11543.98s]  So it's like you would be just be taking cleanse for like
[11548.88s -> 11560.22s]  But you do take away a lot of their ability to kill you if you take cleanse, right?
[11561.70s -> 11569.47s]  Hmm, I'm gonna greed I might regret this though
[11570.27s -> 11572.31s]  Like my gut is telling me to take cleanse
[11572.31s -> 11587.32s]  Because if I take cleanser, they only have one way to kill me.
[11587.32s -> 11591.32s]  Oh look guys, it's 20- yo it's not all stylish I think.
[11591.32s -> 11593.32s]  No it's the fake stylish.
[11593.32s -> 11599.91s]  Wait isn't 21 stylish the fake stylish?
[11599.91s -> 11608.72s]  Is that the real one or the fake one? There's like a fake one out there and I don't know if that's the real one or the fake one.
[11608.72s -> 11609.72s]  Oh it's stylish? Nice.
[11609.72s -> 11617.54s]  What do we reverse again?
[11617.54s -> 11644.66s]  I'll take long 3.
[11644.66s -> 11655.48s]  We'll take long 3 this game just because it'd warm up a bit.
[11655.48s -> 11660.32s]  Actually, like long three more
[11660.90s -> 11674.27s]  Against double range because you can't get poked out. Why don't you like ghost over hill? I do like ghost
[11676.41s -> 11679.33s]  This game particularly I don't think ghost has more value though
[11680.73s -> 11682.25s]  because
[11682.25s -> 11685.61s]  The only like ghost is really good against like triple melee
[11686.19s -> 11691.88s]  Like I like ghost a lot against like triple melee champs or comps
[11692.48s -> 11696.18s]  But there's only two male is and one of them. I don't even consider heck from a melee
[11696.18s -> 11701.68s]  Hecarim's like a fucking... you motherfucker.
[11701.68s -> 11706.52s]  Hecarim's like an assassin, so.
[11706.52s -> 11723.47s]  You know what's interesting?
[11723.47s -> 11726.47s]  This Lulu is bullying the fuck out of us.
[11726.47s -> 11730.36s]  I'm gonna try and get level two.
[11730.36s -> 11738.21s]  So I think Lulu has...
[11738.21s -> 11743.21s]  We could... we could just double E that guy.
[11743.21s -> 11748.38s]  Why would you do that?
[11748.38s -> 11760.56s]  I'm confused as to like, what's happening here.
[11760.56s -> 11768.59s]  Why aren't we fighting these guys?
[11768.59s -> 11772.03s]  This this son or this this
[11772.83s -> 11774.27s]  seraphine's trolling
[11774.27s -> 11776.27s]  So all she had to do there was double e
[11776.83s -> 11777.47s]  That's it
[11777.47s -> 11781.91s]  If she double eat either of them they instantly die because we have heal they don't have heal and we have exhaust
[11782.43s -> 11788.75s]  They've they've they have ghosts. So all you have to do to win. That is double e walk up exhaust the aphelios and we win
[11788.75s -> 11797.56s]  Like he dies. I'm impressed that this guy's I I don't want to be mean. Never mind. I
[11797.56s -> 11799.56s]  I
[11799.56s -> 11801.56s]  There's no reason to be mean
[11801.84s -> 11803.76s]  Maybe he just doesn't
[11803.76s -> 11805.76s]  play seraphine that much I
[11807.34s -> 11811.90s]  Mean, yeah, he like the seraphine should be walking up right now. You see how like far back she is. I
[11812.62s -> 11814.92s]  Can't walk up like at the moment. I just can't
[11815.90s -> 11827.92s]  That's good fucking juke. I
[11829.48s -> 11831.48s]  Really want to push this. Oh
[11834.40s -> 11835.84s]  my
[11835.84s -> 11837.48s]  stylish and god
[11837.48s -> 11841.88s]  He's that was just kind of a god
[11846.48s -> 11847.96s]  Yeah
[11847.96s -> 11849.96s]  What the fucks that was insane?
[11851.16s -> 11853.16s]  My man's fucking smurfing
[11856.27s -> 11857.95s]  Jesus
[11857.95s -> 11862.54s]  Like that was dirty
[11862.54s -> 11888.02s]  guys nuts
[11888.02s -> 11892.70s]  I didn't put any points on my e because when we were in the lane, I didn't have enough
[11896.56s -> 11901.72s]  I didn't have enough mana to use E anyway, so there was no real point to put it in there at the time
[11901.72s -> 11904.48s]  I kind of wish I had E now, but oh
[11918.44s -> 11920.44s]  That was a misposition Jesus
[11920.52s -> 11924.60s]  I'm just off today. I don't know why I
[11925.32s -> 11927.48s]  Don't need to push this. I can just let it sit. I
[11928.48s -> 11932.24s]  Finned it a tiny bit now what we can do here is we just let it sit here
[11932.84s -> 11934.84s]  The felios can't walk up
[11936.77s -> 11941.75s]  Now I would want the seraphine to be like in the bush over there like like up a bit, right?
[11942.25s -> 11946.77s]  Because if she stands in that bush a felios can't walk up. Whereas if she's behind me
[11947.57s -> 11953.49s]  Felios can walk up stand in that bush and soak XP. So stopping the XP soak is very important
[11956.96s -> 11961.16s]  I need to run to this fight. I think the fights over already. I think my team trolled but I'm still gonna run to it
[11962.24s -> 11979.99s]  Not bad
[11979.99s -> 11981.19s]  Nice
[11981.19s -> 11984.50s]  So I'm very low right now
[11985.02s -> 11989.90s]  Um, I think the only thing to do is actually just the back. So the way the wave is set up right now. I
[11990.94s -> 11995.66s]  Can't push it before they get back to lane. It will like slow push towards them
[11996.50s -> 11998.50s]  But I don't think I have a choice
[11999.74s -> 12003.10s]  I'd have to this is something that I'm actually I'd have to actually rewatch. I
[12003.10s -> 12009.10s]  I know I think it's actually frozen, but I think maybe I should have cleared one minion maybe two
[12009.86s -> 12012.22s]  So that it doesn't like crash and it stays frozen
[12015.15s -> 12017.15s]  Unless I did it correctly
[12017.59s -> 12022.47s]  Maybe I'm overthinking it. All right, I think I did it right. Yeah, I did. Okay, never mind
[12022.47s -> 12024.95s]  I thought I was like overthinking it
[12039.12s -> 12041.92s]  What I think about ghosts instead of healing jinx. I think it's great
[12042.76s -> 12046.36s]  Like I said, um this game specifically, I think he'll has more value
[12046.36s -> 12049.54s]  But I think in a lot of games ghost is very good
[12050.92s -> 12053.40s]  Ghost is good on ash good on jinx good on a phallus
[12053.92s -> 12058.12s]  Zary like 80 carries at the moment the ghost meta is really good because they're like
[12058.24s -> 12065.58s]  There's a really heavy like tank bruiser meta going on right coupled with like an enchanter meta or like a bot lane
[12065.58s -> 12070.16s]  Where it's like a bunch of melees. I suck Jesus and because of that. I think it's actually
[12072.04s -> 12073.96s]  Ghost is super good. I just this game
[12073.96s -> 12083.14s]  There's only two melee's on the enemy team and I didn't want to just farm lane this. I wanted to be able to fight early
[12084.78s -> 12088.76s]  Well, okay, so the reason you take ghosts is because you farm lane
[12090.22s -> 12094.78s]  You're not looking to fight early when you take ghost. That's the whole point of ghost. It's a scaling
[12094.78s -> 12098.94s]  It's a hundred percent a scaling summoner. So if you're playing in lower elo
[12099.46s -> 12105.94s]  And you you know, you want to take ghost you want to try it out just realize that like you are trying to scale
[12106.62s -> 12107.98s]  Oh
[12107.98s -> 12109.98s]  somebody afk
[12110.34s -> 12117.17s]  Okay, that's cringe
[12117.21s -> 12121.37s]  Like if you're in say you're in like gold silver plat whatever you are you're in
[12121.57s -> 12126.95s]  That's like you deemed as like, you know a bit of the lower elos. I don't even think plots that low but gold and silver
[12126.95s -> 12128.21s]  right
[12128.21s -> 12132.13s]  Because gold is average. So it's like not even low typically but everybody says it's low
[12134.73s -> 12140.69s]  If you if you take ghost just understand that you are playing for mid game bronze still you're playing for mid game
[12140.69s -> 12145.25s]  Yeah, ghost is fun. I I would take personally I would probably take heal in bronze
[12145.97s -> 12150.21s]  Just because I think you can take advantage of lane phase really hard in bronze
[12150.77s -> 12155.27s]  like bronze elo to me is like I
[12155.99s -> 12159.31s]  Should have reported that guy. I'm stupid bronze elo to me is like
[12160.15s -> 12162.15s]  you can learn how to
[12162.87s -> 12167.11s]  Abuse people's lane phase really hard because people will fight a lot in bronze, right?
[12167.11s -> 12172.27s]  Like they will take bad trades or they will like try and fight because they don't know typically if you're bronze
[12172.27s -> 12176.35s]  You probably don't know like the champions very well and the damage stuff and stuff like that
[12176.59s -> 12181.21s]  So what ends up happening is like you probably just die a bunch or there are probably a lot of deaths in bronze
[12181.67s -> 12184.64s]  so I
[12184.64s -> 12186.64s]  would say
[12186.68s -> 12192.20s]  Playing to like be able to help yourself early games with all the fighting going on is gonna have a lot more value than
[12192.20s -> 12194.20s]  ghost
[12194.20s -> 12200.20s]  Ghost is more of like a we hit mid game or a giant fight broke out and I can like it's an extended long
[12200.20s -> 12202.20s]  Fight and I can get ghost utilization
[12202.20s -> 12207.12s]  Also, Ghost is really valuable when you have good mechanical skill, like Ghost requires
[12207.12s -> 12211.20s]  very good positioning typically, because you're repositioning a lot in the fight.
[12211.20s -> 12214.32s]  And that's why Ghost is so good, because you can reposition back forward, back forward,
[12214.32s -> 12215.32s]  back forward.
[12215.32s -> 12223.53s]  And you can essentially like space the enemy and get free damage.
[12223.53s -> 12227.05s]  Free boots too, depends on the champion and the matchup.
[12227.05s -> 12232.65s]  Like if I'm playing Jinx, and I'm playing into like, I don't know, let's say I'm
[12232.65s -> 12234.97s]  I'm playing into like heist of Lulu, okay.
[12234.97s -> 12236.25s]  You can take free boots.
[12236.25s -> 12238.21s]  You don't need early boots in that matchup
[12238.21s -> 12240.43s]  because it's an enchanter farm AD carry
[12240.43s -> 12242.93s]  versus an enchanter farm AD carry, okay.
[12242.93s -> 12245.45s]  Now, if I'm versus, let's say I'm versus like a Blitzcrank.
[12245.45s -> 12247.95s]  Let's say I'm playing Jinx and I'm versus Blitz.
[12247.95s -> 12249.65s]  Like I typically don't wanna have to wait
[12249.65s -> 12250.77s]  till nine minutes to get boots
[12250.77s -> 12252.99s]  because Blitzcrank's gonna shit on me.
[12252.99s -> 12255.73s]  So I will take different runes
[12255.73s -> 12257.81s]  versus that Blitzcrank to allow myself
[12258.73s -> 12260.97s]  the option of like, let's say I have 1,100 gold
[12260.97s -> 12262.61s]  and I back, I can get early boots
[12262.61s -> 12271.01s]  and now the Blitzcrank has a much harder time.
[12271.01s -> 12272.29s]  Dude, I almost want to ban Zed
[12272.29s -> 12274.37s]  because I don't want to get shit on by Stylish,
[12274.37s -> 12275.57s]  but I think it's cringe.
[12276.73s -> 12295.18s]  I don't want to like ban Stylish out.
[12295.18s -> 12296.22s]  How often is AD carry bot?
[12296.22s -> 12298.36s]  Do you play parallel to your support?
[12298.36s -> 12301.73s]  You try to always.
[12301.73s -> 12303.65s]  Essentially, the perfect way to play bot lane
[12303.65s -> 12307.01s]  is you're both hitting one target at the same time,
[12307.01s -> 12308.41s]  trading on one target at the same time.
[12308.41s -> 12310.53s]  You're making like a little triangle
[12310.53s -> 12312.05s]  and you're both just like standing next to each other
[12312.05s -> 12315.77s]  and you're both hitting that one target, right?
[12315.77s -> 12321.88s]  the best way to play bot lane but it's very hard in solo queue obviously to do that but if you have
[12321.88s -> 12328.76s]  like a duo you can practice it sorry it went down the wrong pipe 80k tier list i should make one
[12329.72s -> 12337.64s]  i have this thing where even though i'm like grand master level i still think i suck i have
[12337.64s -> 12341.08s]  this like really lack of confidence because i i used to be challenger and now i'm like hard
[12341.08s -> 12346.60s]  stuck gm so like i have this lack of confidence in what i'm talking about so like i feel like
[12346.60s -> 12351.00s]  if I were to make a tier list, it would be based on like a GM players skill.
[12351.64s -> 12354.60s]  And I don't know if like I don't want to get ripped apart by people.
[12356.84s -> 12359.24s]  But I guess I could make a tier list for my own opinion.
[12376.00s -> 12377.52s]  Like, let me see tier list maker.
[12378.72s -> 12380.96s]  I'm sure there's a tier list maker with champions, right?
[12412.56s -> 12413.20s]  Yeah, there it is.
[12414.32s -> 12415.28s]  Wait, this is terrible.
[12415.28s -> 12416.48s]  What is what are these pictures?
[12422.99s -> 12424.83s]  I'm just what what is this?
[12424.83s -> 12425.55s]  What is this?
[12427.15s -> 12428.35s]  Why is Nico on here?
[12428.35s -> 12447.84s]  I want to use this one, but this one doesn't have Zary. I am trying to find one with Zary on it
[12447.84s -> 12450.12s]  That doesn't look like shit. It says this one has Zary
[12450.84s -> 12467.64s]  But it looks like it looks shitty. I don't I don't enjoy that. Hold on. We're gonna play Ash this game because they picked Zareth
[12468.40s -> 12471.56s]  Like I just saw him first pick Zareth. So I want something that can engage on the Zareth
[12473.24s -> 12476.72s]  So we're gonna go Ash these gonna be my Ash runes this game boys
[12477.84s -> 12491.57s]  So I'm gonna go presence of minds. I don't know I kind of do but I kind of don't
[12492.65s -> 12495.91s]  I think presence of mind kind of sucks. It feels kind of shitty.
[12500.79s -> 12502.79s]  We can just do overkill.
[12503.11s -> 12510.24s]  We can go lacrity. I probably won't go kraken slayer this game, so we could probably just go lacrity.
[12511.92s -> 12515.08s]  Even though kraken slayer is not bad on ash, I kind of want to go board crush.
[12515.64s -> 12530.68s]  But I could go... I actually don't know what I want to take if I want to take borderline or lacrity.
[12530.68s -> 12532.68s]  I'm gonna take lacrity. We'll try it out.
[12532.96s -> 12537.04s]  And then we'll do ghost. Okay. Um, what was I gonna say?
[12537.04s -> 12547.33s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, I need to find the right tier list. I mean I could just use this right I
[12548.61s -> 12557.17s]  Can't where's Zeri? Oh
[12558.41s -> 12560.41s]  Oh, there we go
[12560.65s -> 12564.49s]  Yeah, this is good. Okay. I was like I was trying to figure it out. I was like, what the fuck
[12566.64s -> 12570.28s]  I think just straight out of the gate. I was putting Jinx and S tier. I
[12571.40s -> 12574.68s]  Think Jinx is just an S tier champion. She's crazy OP
[12574.68s -> 12580.80s]  Jynx just does what every champion wants to do, but better than them.
[12580.80s -> 12582.40s]  She's blind pickable.
[12582.40s -> 12585.52s]  Her 2 item, 3 item spike is crazy.
[12585.52s -> 12590.24s]  She doesn't have a lot of really bad matchups in lane phase anymore.
[12590.24s -> 12594.82s]  They gave her scaling like crazy high, like she's just good.
[12594.82s -> 12595.82s]  Good build paths, etc.
[12595.82s -> 12600.51s]  Like she's just a good champion.
[12600.51s -> 12603.51s]  I would say it's also hard to do tier list because you have to do tier list
[12603.51s -> 12606.35s]  for low elo and high elo, right?
[12606.35s -> 12613.15s]  if I'm doing like a low elo tier list, you're putting MF like here. Right? Like MF super
[12613.15s -> 12618.41s]  good. But if you're doing a high elo tier list, MF is like here. It's it's hard to
[12618.41s -> 12623.63s]  explain. And like in low elo, I'm putting Kalista here. But in high elo, I'm putting
[12623.63s -> 12633.03s]  her here. So it's it's really interesting. Right? Because it's all based on like people's
[12633.03s -> 12639.23s]  mechanical skill too. But yeah, we do the tier list between games, I guess. So far,
[12639.23s -> 12641.99s]  I think Jinx is definitely S tier.
[12641.99s -> 12645.62s]  I wish there was like an S plus tier,
[12645.62s -> 12647.84s]  but Jinx is definitely S tier.
[12647.84s -> 12649.84s]  Draven's hard to choose for me.
[12649.84s -> 12651.80s]  Like I want to put him in A tier
[12651.80s -> 12653.04s]  because he has a lot of counter matchups,
[12653.04s -> 12654.60s]  but in solo queue,
[12654.60s -> 12658.78s]  Draven feels insane.
[12658.78s -> 12659.78s]  So it's hard.
[12659.78s -> 12660.90s]  Cause I don't think Draven,
[12660.90s -> 12663.72s]  I think Draven's overrated personally.
[12663.72s -> 12666.08s]  Cause I know how to beat Draven players.
[12666.08s -> 12668.38s]  But I also think in high elo,
[12669.42s -> 12671.78s]  when people also know how to deal with Draven players,
[12671.78s -> 12680.85s]  the game I also do feel like good Draven players and good people who know how to
[12680.85s -> 12684.97s]  play around Draven players make Draven OP but it's also the opposite we're good
[12684.97s -> 12688.03s]  players you know how to play around Draven can counterpick Draven and make
[12688.03s -> 12707.49s]  him worthless so it's it's really it's really hard alright let me say
[12707.49s -> 12720.80s]  Morgana versus a Moo Moo. Gen players. Gen players are psychopaths man
[12720.80s -> 12726.80s]  Like I I don't think Jin's very good right now. I think he could be good if they gave him like a quality of life change
[12727.00s -> 12737.93s]  Isn't he getting buff next patch? I think he's getting buffed. I think he should do like Jin's such a fun champ
[12737.93s -> 12739.77s]  He's just like a little shitty
[12739.77s -> 12752.40s]  We can actually just straight fight them right now if a moomoo just queues
[12755.75s -> 12769.56s]  Because Morgana is worthless level one. Like I actually just straight-up want to fight these guys right now. Go go go
[12769.56s -> 12782.15s]  Oh, he missed both his queues
[12782.15s -> 12788.33s]  Dude, this Amumu's killing me man.
[12788.33s -> 12789.91s]  Oh my god, I-
[12789.91s -> 12795.66s]  Bro, what am I watching?
[12795.66s -> 12802.49s]  What are these queues, brother?
[12802.49s -> 12804.17s]  Holy shit!
[12804.17s -> 12809.21s]  Alright, I should have taken a long sword.
[12809.21s -> 12814.86s]  Amumu is not feeling himself today, let me tell you what.
[12814.86s -> 12834.79s]  He is not feeling himself.
[12834.79s -> 12835.79s]  Chase.
[12835.79s -> 12838.51s]  Even if Ez comes, chase.
[12838.51s -> 12845.67s]  Okay, we run.
[12845.67s -> 12847.41s]  Uh, I don't know if we can fight this.
[12847.41s -> 12848.31s]  We can try.
[12849.75s -> 12864.35s]  I'll volley.
[12864.35s -> 12872.44s]  Well, I mean, that guy should die.
[12872.44s -> 12873.28s]  Dude, what?
[12873.28s -> 12874.38s]  I don't even know what's happening right now.
[12874.38s -> 12880.19s]  This is, this is crazy.
[12880.19s -> 12882.25s]  This is, this is ridiculous.
[12882.25s -> 12894.64s]  Both mid laners just got like three kills out of nowhere.
[12894.64s -> 12896.18s]  We went from like a ridiculously,
[12896.18s -> 12898.12s]  we went from like a grand master game
[12898.12s -> 12904.05s]  to like a diamond game, like somehow.
[12904.05s -> 12906.81s]  Like the Amumu's like kind of whipping some shit.
[12907.81s -> 12910.81s]  I took a bad trade early, then fucking...
[12910.81s -> 12912.81s]  This shit is funny as fuck.
[12912.81s -> 12918.53s]  So I'm gonna actually rush tier 2 boots this game.
[12919.53s -> 12923.53s]  Because I actually really, really, really...
[12923.53s -> 12925.53s]  Want to be mobile against their team.
[12925.53s -> 12928.53s]  Like, I'm just gonna straight up leave, go buy T2 boots.
[12928.53s -> 12931.53s]  And that's gonna be my power spike for Ashe right now.
[12931.53s -> 12935.97s]  They have so many things that I can dodge on their team.
[12935.97s -> 12936.97s]  Like, look at this shit, right?
[12936.97s -> 12940.97s]  Like, morg binding, T2 boots, super easy to dodge
[12940.97s -> 12944.13s]  If she can't flash it on me, right? Like if she can't flash melee range the Morgbind
[12944.13s -> 12947.01s]  It's I should never get hit by unless I have no fingers
[12947.81s -> 12949.81s]  Ezreal Q easy to dodge
[12950.13s -> 12953.41s]  Xerath easy to dodge this guy. Whatever the fuck
[12954.13s -> 12965.45s]  Kha'zix bugman. He's a melee champ. So boots have value etc. Also the cool thing about boots boots rush
[12965.45s -> 12967.45s]  Ash is she doesn't have damage
[12968.37s -> 12972.25s]  That if I'm good at spacing like the better at spacing you are
[12972.25s -> 12980.33s]  You can actually just 1v2, especially against double skillshots like this.
[12980.33s -> 12981.33s]  It's pretty fun.
[12981.33s -> 13008.49s]  Fuck, if I juked that last Q I would have killed that guy.
[13008.49s -> 13011.77s]  Dude, Xerath actually fucked us so bad though.
[13011.77s -> 13014.77s]  That was a good fight until Xerath just showed up and beat our ass.
[13014.77s -> 13031.66s]  Yeah, just get the minion wave.
[13031.66s -> 13035.42s]  It's kind of funny to watch though, because I do so little damage, but I also like
[13035.42s -> 13042.09s]  just perma slow so they can't do anything about it.
[13042.09s -> 13047.61s]  Maybe when TF gets 6, he can come bot and we can fuck over their bot lane.
[13047.61s -> 13049.37s]  I'm hoping that that's the case.
[13049.37s -> 13055.84s]  Uh oh.
[13055.84s -> 13059.08s]  We're gonna roam to mid, Kha'Zix is also mid, TF's dead.
[13059.08s -> 13064.60s]  That was a good roam.
[13064.60s -> 13073.43s]  I'm gonna push this so that maybe we can play for a dragon.
[13073.43s -> 13078.88s]  Because they might go for a dragon here and I think we can stop it.
[13078.88s -> 13079.88s]  We have TF ults.
[13079.88s -> 13084.88s]  Yep.
[13084.88s -> 13088.98s]  Nice.
[13088.98s -> 13090.70s]  We just leave.
[13090.70s -> 13092.46s]  We don't need to actually chase or do anything crazy.
[13092.46s -> 13093.46s]  We're just stopping the dragon.
[13093.46s -> 13094.46s]  That's all we're doing.
[13094.46s -> 13095.46s]  Right?
[13095.46s -> 13102.33s]  We don't wanna give them a free drink.
[13102.33s -> 13103.97s]  See, the T2 boots are just broken.
[13103.97s -> 13111.95s]  They're broken as shit.
[13111.95s -> 13115.07s]  Cause you can just see, like I can pretty much just,
[13115.07s -> 13119.84s]  I'm just too fast for them to deal with.
[13119.84s -> 13121.48s]  Like look at this, it's insane.
[13130.85s -> 13133.45s]  And that's why I value like the tier two boots
[13133.45s -> 13135.37s]  on champions, especially like Ashe,
[13135.37s -> 13138.13s]  where you can be extra egregious with it.
[13138.13s -> 13141.21s]  Cause like her slow, imagine it's like,
[13141.21s -> 13142.85s]  you know, it's the same idea as Vayne, right?
[13142.85s -> 13143.97s]  When you think about it.
[13143.97s -> 13146.65s]  It's like, okay, so what's really annoying
[13146.65s -> 13150.49s]  trying to run away from a vein right she gets boots too and you're like god
[13150.49s -> 13155.53s]  damn it man she's so fast same thing with ash oh wait now you're slow so it's
[13155.53s -> 13158.53s]  even more annoying you try you try and go in on her she just spaces you walks
[13158.53s -> 13162.17s]  away a bit now you're just sitting there waddling towards her slowly just upset
[13162.17s -> 13185.33s]  tilted frustrated you know it's like your middle school dance you know
[13185.33s -> 13194.82s]  what I think this is actually a shield bow game it is I was gonna go
[13194.82s -> 13196.82s]  I think this is a shield build game.
[13196.82s -> 13200.82s]  It could be a galeforce game too. Both are viable.
[13200.82s -> 13206.82s]  But I might be in the minority here with this.
[13206.82s -> 13210.82s]  I think Borkrush on Ashe is actually good sometimes.
[13210.82s -> 13215.82s]  I think if that was versus some tanks, like a Sion or something like that.
[13215.82s -> 13218.82s]  I actually think Borkrush on Ashe is kind of cracked.
[13219.54s -> 13224.02s]  Like yeah, it stalls out like you make the argument like it stalls out your three item or two item
[13224.30s -> 13226.52s]  But it's it feels kind of nuts
[13227.82s -> 13232.82s]  Also, this is a really OP thing that you can do. I should have hawkshotted sooner. I knew that they were doing
[13233.34s -> 13236.42s]  Rift, but I'm not paying attention as much as I should be
[13237.12s -> 13243.71s]  so
[13243.71s -> 13249.41s]  Because what you can do is you can hawk shot to tell your team where the enemy jungler is and get information yourself
[13249.41s -> 13253.56s]  I
[13253.56s -> 13255.56s]  Mean this Morgana's level five
[13255.88s -> 13260.15s]  We could fight just because morgue is five right now. I
[13262.19s -> 13264.19s]  Kind of want to try
[13269.26s -> 13271.26s]  My mumu didn't want to go in
[13271.38s -> 13272.70s]  my bad
[13272.70s -> 13277.49s]  I'm a little sad. I'm not gonna lie cuz I
[13278.01s -> 13282.05s]  Do feel like we win these fights, but a mumu wants to wait for six
[13282.65s -> 13285.47s]  Which is fine. But like I said, you guys know me
[13285.47s -> 13291.13s]  I like to actually fight and be active in the lane early because I know that we can fight right and
[13291.13s -> 13304.93s]  And so it's like obviously, you know, oh this is really rough. I
[13306.17s -> 13309.58s]  Can't do anything
[13309.58s -> 13311.58s]  Cuz there it's here
[13312.50s -> 13317.38s]  TF's coming with ult though. I don't have ults. God damn it if I had ult this would be so god tier
[13319.89s -> 13322.41s]  God, you have no idea how OP this would be if I had ulti men
[13323.85s -> 13329.98s]  Whatever I'm bad. I want to push this wave out. I'm assuming they're all backing. I
[13329.98s -> 13336.94s]  I think we penta there it with all we even killed the top laner. Oh, I'm dead. Why did I stay? I
[13338.34s -> 13340.30s]  Knew cosmetics would do that
[13340.30s -> 13345.62s]  I have to retrain my brain cosmetics players are rats and I have to retrain my brain to remember that they will sit in
[13345.62s -> 13349.38s]  A bush for 30 minutes to lose all of their farm to get one kill. I
[13350.06s -> 13352.06s]  Like always forget that
[13352.06s -> 13357.48s]  Like cosmetics players are absolute fucking rats
[13359.36s -> 13364.80s]  Like I respect Rengar players more than cosmetics players. Yeah, I said it
[13365.10s -> 13373.07s]  I know hot take I know but I do i'm gonna try an arrow right here
[13377.28s -> 13380.26s]  Got him
[13380.26s -> 13382.26s]  You know that guy's pissed by the way
[13383.46s -> 13390.80s]  God damn it
[13390.80s -> 13392.80s]  He's gonna try and ult me from the bush
[13393.60s -> 13397.20s]  You can always tell that you're about to get ulted when an ezreal big big tip for you guys
[13397.68s -> 13401.36s]  If an ezreal ever walks out of vision expect that he's ulting you
[13403.12s -> 13404.72s]  I you would not believe
[13404.72s -> 13409.84s]  You would not believe the amount of people that I kill with ezreal by simply walking into a bush and ulting them
[13410.32s -> 13412.32s]  And they forget that I exist
[13413.04s -> 13415.36s]  I'm not i'm not even it happens so often
[13416.56s -> 13419.28s]  They're just like, oh, yeah, he went in the bush. He's gonna hit his alt key
[13420.24s -> 13423.28s]  Like I it is comical how often it happens
[13424.16s -> 13426.16s]  And i'm sure you guys have died to it, too
[13427.44s -> 13431.44s]  Because it's like a thing where like you never see you barely you don't see ezreal that often, right?
[13431.44s -> 13434.64s]  So because you probably don't see Ezreal too often you're always like, oh
[13436.99s -> 13445.62s]  Interesting type shit. I'm gonna grab this plate and then I'm gonna back up
[13447.54s -> 13449.98s]  Kha'Zix is coming down here. So I'm gonna back the fuck up
[13451.30s -> 13453.30s]  So I don't have arrow for 20
[13453.98s -> 13456.10s]  Ezreal has Triforce. We need to back up a bit
[13459.46s -> 13461.46s]  We might have to give dragon
[13461.46s -> 13474.40s]  I could see giving dragon being okay though. It's not that bad. Yeah, it's not it's not the worst to give drake here. I
[13474.40s -> 13477.44s]  I could even back so we don't get dove
[13479.24s -> 13487.52s]  Like if we back now we might lose bot turret, but I can't walk up. Yeah, that's what I didn't want to have happen
[13488.40s -> 13492.37s]  See that's
[13492.37s -> 13494.37s]  I'm telling you bad rats
[13495.33s -> 13500.53s]  absolute rats
[13500.53s -> 13504.53s]  Kha'zix players are rats man. Absolute literal rats. Oh
[13514.18s -> 13524.88s]  That's classy that's a good dodge I can't even walk up bot
[13524.88s -> 13528.48s]  I can wait for the turret, but I can't walk up
[13529.84s -> 13531.84s]  I'll just die
[13532.00s -> 13537.12s]  That's another thing you have to just accept like I'm down 40 CS this game because we've just been getting
[13537.84s -> 13539.84s]  We excited and we've also been getting
[13541.76s -> 13543.76s]  Like a moomoo is not very good I
[13544.96s -> 13548.20s]  Don't I don't have a better way to say it. I don't have like a nice way to say it
[13548.20s -> 13550.20s]  He's not having a good game
[13551.12s -> 13553.92s]  And when your support doesn't have a good game, you don't have a good game early
[13554.88s -> 13561.36s]  So the best thing you can do is just try and uh farm up what you can don't die and scale for late
[13563.95s -> 13567.15s]  That's all you can really do as an ad carry when your support sucks
[13568.83s -> 13570.83s]  It feels really bad, but
[13571.79s -> 13573.79s]  Sometimes you just got to accept it, right?
[13581.81s -> 13584.61s]  This Ezreal's not bad, but he's not good either
[13585.81s -> 13588.21s]  Oh, this guy's gonna try and ult me. I'm gonna ult kill rancher
[13592.30s -> 13604.83s]  nice
[13604.83s -> 13606.83s]  I don't have ult up yet guys
[13606.83s -> 13612.91s]  I don't have ult up yet. I can't ulti. I have ult now, but we need to bait them in a bit
[13612.91s -> 13617.84s]  I don't even want to use my ult right now to be honest with you
[13618.98s -> 13620.98s]  Like I really don't
[13621.90s -> 13625.98s]  You know, what's funny that Zarya is actually pretty good I've played against them a few times in the past few seasons
[13626.54s -> 13629.52s]  He's actually not bad. He used to be a support main
[13630.90s -> 13636.95s]  Like he played Zarya support. That's why I recognized his name
[13643.13s -> 13645.01s]  We should not
[13645.01s -> 13648.15s]  Go for this rift. I'm on a bad timer for this
[13649.91s -> 13660.05s]  Because I'm really low HP and mana. Oh, I don't have mana
[13661.25s -> 13676.34s]  To arrow here guys. I do not want to arrow that because the the Fiora can totally the Fiora can do whatever it's called and
[13681.54s -> 13682.98s]  the Fiora can
[13682.98s -> 13684.98s]  What's it? Whatever it's called?
[13685.06s -> 13687.50s]  W it if she's fast enough and I didn't want to get my team killed
[13688.70s -> 13690.70s]  The real issue here is that we're forcing
[13690.70s -> 13695.74s]  Okay, I'll tell you exactly what the real issue is.
[13695.74s -> 13698.54s]  We're forcing too many fights for no reason right now.
[13698.54s -> 13701.22s]  So we're all forcing tons of fights at the moment, right?
[13701.22s -> 13705.22s]  But there's no reason for us to force these fights.
[13705.22s -> 13707.78s]  That's why my team's getting tilted, right?
[13707.78s -> 13713.42s]  For some reason, the Amumu and the TF are both just inting and they're both getting
[13713.42s -> 13718.18s]  frustrated, but we actually win the game if we play it slow.
[13718.18s -> 13727.48s]  We can slow play this game out in scale, but it just takes time.
[13727.48s -> 13730.96s]  I specifically picked Ashe so that we could we had an answer for Xerath
[13731.68s -> 13736.28s]  Because we have TF and Ashe right so we have we have a really good answer for him. The problem is
[13738.12s -> 13740.12s]  We need to like stop tilting and just like
[13740.76s -> 13742.60s]  Understand that we can deal with him later
[13742.60s -> 13747.66s]  He's not like a he's not like an A-Soul right like A-Soul is one of those champs that like you can't deal with
[13748.52s -> 13753.56s]  Why did my Amumu wait to use ulti?
[13754.76s -> 13756.76s]  What?
[13756.80s -> 13758.80s]  He was in range
[13759.88s -> 13768.12s]  I know he was oh
[13769.12s -> 13773.16s]  Nice, okay. We got a kill. We need TF to play the game too, though
[13774.60s -> 13777.32s]  Our TF is really tilted. So he's just sitting bot
[13780.78s -> 13786.02s]  Amumu was extra tilted too, but I mean I'll be I'll be honest the Amumu is playing worse than TF
[13786.02s -> 13788.96s]  It's just that he's dude. I hate when stuff happens like this
[13789.54s -> 13794.50s]  Stop stop pinging the guy man. He's already frustrated you pinging him is not gonna make him less frustrated
[13795.38s -> 13797.38s]  You're just gonna piss him off more
[13798.58s -> 13804.66s]  Like just play dude. We have a really good team comp
[13805.88s -> 13815.82s]  Like we're behind right now, but we have a good team comp. We should give this dragon by the way
[13816.36s -> 13819.80s]  Like a thousand percent. We don't have tf-holts
[13820.88s -> 13824.88s]  Like maybe maybe we could fight this but the morgues here so she can special my arrow
[13825.12s -> 13827.36s]  They got rift like we should give the drink
[13827.88s -> 13832.28s]  We also have no vision control of this area
[13833.44s -> 13838.12s]  So this is another thing of like why you guys wonder like why I play support in this elo
[13838.12s -> 13841.04s]  Like I get asked a lot like why are you a support main now?
[13841.04s -> 13847.80s]  I'm still an AD main but the thing is it's really hard to play the game when your supports don't ward
[13848.52s -> 13849.92s]  correctly
[13849.92s -> 13854.12s]  We can give this guys we can give it's not a huge deal. Nars top. We do not have to fight this
[13855.00s -> 13857.00s]  Guys, we don't have to fight this
[13857.12s -> 13866.18s]  It's back up. Yeah, like this isn't a fight. It's only second dragon. It's nothing
[13867.42s -> 13879.66s]  Wow, I suck at CSing
[13879.66s -> 13883.88s]  But you see how little vision control we have on the map right now. We have one ward here and that's about it
[13885.14s -> 13888.38s]  Vision control is I say it's 90% of the game in solo queue
[13888.78s -> 13893.48s]  That's why I like I feel like supports are like the unsung hero like when you get a support who knows how to properly
[13893.48s -> 13903.72s]  Throw out vision control. It feels insane. We just got to push. I
[13904.72s -> 13908.10s]  Do have hawk shot and in a second we can see if they're on this
[13909.40s -> 13911.40s]  Okay, they're not I
[13912.04s -> 13914.04s]  Can volley we can back up
[13914.04s -> 13927.45s]  up. Kha'Zix is above me right now. Okay, Kha'Zix wasted his ults. That's not bad. We should
[13927.45s -> 13935.05s]  back. I don't want to take this fight. TF could ulti, but he's not. Right? Like this
[13935.05s -> 13937.89s]  is one of those moments where I actually think we actually could have killed two
[13937.89s -> 13945.85s]  of them right there. If TF ulted. Because they were out of position really hard. But
[13945.85s -> 13953.72s]  again it's not like I think they're gonna walk I think Kha'Zix is yeah he's
[13953.72s -> 13957.64s]  he's somewhere up here I don't know where he is and I can't I can't hawk
[13957.64s -> 13962.90s]  shot I wasted my hawk shot for this dragon or this Baron they could be on
[13962.90s -> 13967.78s]  Baron we need to check but I have no hawk shots okay they're not they're
[13967.78s -> 13984.78s]  not we're chilling good good I need a hundred golds yeah I'm aware I'm
[13984.78s -> 14002.85s]  getting ganked I'm fully fucking aware trust me I'm just trying to
[14002.85s -> 14018.22s]  forced them to make a choice probably wasn't a great use of my ghost but I say
[14018.22s -> 14023.82s]  we bail I need to go get my item Ezreal's just pushing aside somehow
[14023.82s -> 14039.03s]  uncontested over there somebody just TPed bot what what the fuck is this a
[14039.03s -> 14043.87s]  moomoo doing what is my team doing what are you guys doing this is so
[14043.87s -> 14056.78s]  awkward man I mean guys guys kill kill the
[14056.78s -> 14064.62s]  Kha'Zix oh thank god i don't know why Kha'Zix just dove to kill me of all people
[14066.06s -> 14073.58s]  my man just like wanted me dead he was like yeah fuck that ad carry guy like okay sure
[14075.58s -> 14083.53s]  fuck me what do i want i feel like i need damage but i don't know what gives me the highest
[14083.53s -> 14099.00s]  damage here maybe just i don't know maybe just pd i'm not actually sure i you would be good but
[14099.00s -> 14103.72s]  it doesn't give me like more it gives me like i is interesting in this position
[14105.64s -> 14110.28s]  like i almost want more movement speed from the like pd even though normally like the
[14110.28s -> 14121.14s]  utilities better like maybe bt is still the best and i'm just trolling we can just do
[14121.14s -> 14126.02s]  Dragon right now. They have no TP or Baron. I think we totally actually could do this
[14127.06s -> 14134.20s]  I'm down to try if you if you want to Rengar. They got two people blot. They're setting up for dragon vision right now
[14134.72s -> 14137.84s]  I'm actually kind of down to just try and play for Baron here
[14144.75s -> 14149.31s]  Like we could bait Baron here and force them to walk into us with my arrow I
[14177.26s -> 14179.82s]  Want to stay together because I don't know where the Kha'Zix is
[14180.42s -> 14198.92s]  Found him. What is my mumu doing? Dude? He has smite like I pull it out if you're gonna do this, right? Like
[14199.80s -> 14220.48s]  I'll use your brain man. All right. Now we do Baron though. We have to we have to do Baron
[14220.90s -> 14228.82s]  This is like one of the worst players I've ever seen this a mumu. He has no clue what he's doing, by the way
[14229.88s -> 14235.99s]  Like he's so dumb
[14235.99s -> 14242.43s]  He's he's like flaming the TF. He's in his mind. He's so angry at this TF that he's ignoring every single thing that's going on
[14242.43s -> 14247.91s]  Like, he's ignoring that the dragon was a bad call to begin with.
[14247.91s -> 14251.51s]  And if we are going to do that dragon, we have to zone the fucking jungler because he has
[14251.51s -> 14254.33s]  fucking smite, right?
[14254.33s -> 14258.93s]  So it's like, what are you talking about, man?
[14258.93s -> 14261.11s]  These players are crazy.
[14261.11s -> 14263.77s]  It just feels to me like they're so angry at everything.
[14263.77s -> 14264.77s]  It's kind of funny.
[14264.77s -> 14267.92s]  Okay, I got three items now.
[14267.92s -> 14272.48s]  I went for the PD because I kind of think the extra movement speed and the extra...
[14272.48s -> 14281.09s]  help a lot i will say both the junglers are playing really well this game is like interesting
[14282.85s -> 14286.37s]  like both the assassin junglers are playing pretty well the enemy xerath's playing pretty decent
[14293.06s -> 14299.38s]  uh what that is not a i i i mean that was embarrassing like i i don't even have words
[14299.38s -> 14313.88s]  for that like i genuinely don't have words for that shit i missed i can't see we have no vision
[14313.88s -> 14326.21s]  man like we have no vision nothing's warded because amumu didn't put any wards down
[14329.49s -> 14334.61s]  so i can't fight because literally we're standing there in this area and there's nothing warded
[14339.54s -> 14343.62s]  the best part is all amumu had to do was not die before that fight and we auto win
[14344.26s -> 14349.22s]  like we were winning so hard but this amumu is actually solo losing us the game with his
[14349.22s -> 14360.93s]  this fucking ego. God, support players are so bad at League! Actually! And they'll deflect!
[14360.93s -> 14364.87s]  Support players will lie to themselves about how good they are and tell them that it's
[14364.87s -> 14372.01s]  always their team's fault, but they'll drop 9 deaths, have 9kp in a fucking 23 kill game,
[14372.01s -> 14394.82s]  and then blame their fucking team. It's crazy! Please ward things, man. Oh my
[14394.82s -> 14397.82s]  Oh my god. He's dead again.
[14397.82s -> 14406.93s]  Guys, why are we up here top?
[14406.93s -> 14408.93s]  Why are we top, guys?
[14408.93s -> 14417.59s]  Why are we three-manning top right now?
[14418.59s -> 14420.59s]  Holy crap.
[14420.59s -> 14423.59s]  My teammates are absolute apes.
[14423.59s -> 14428.22s]  Like, what am I watching, man?
[14428.22s -> 14430.22s]  They just three-man top.
[14430.22s -> 14438.34s]  Oh my god.
[14438.34s -> 14441.34s]  Like, these are the worst players I've ever fucking seen.
[14441.34s -> 14447.08s]  Like we had the game in our hands and then all of a sudden my team's like, you know what?
[14447.08s -> 14448.66s]  I don't actually want to win.
[14448.66s -> 14449.66s]  And I'm like, why?
[14449.66s -> 14455.60s]  And they're like, well, you see, I have an ego and you're like, oh, I see.
[14455.60s -> 14458.78s]  This is why I can't play AD carry in the zero, I'm sorry.
[14458.78s -> 14465.30s]  I can't, I have to play support in the zero because AD carry is actually not playable
[14465.30s -> 14469.86s]  when the entire game is decided by jungle, support and mid.
[14469.86s -> 14475.14s]  ADC does not decide any of the League of Legends games below Grandmaster.
[14475.14s -> 14476.14s]  Not one of them.
[14476.14s -> 14480.90s]  Like last game, we popped off and we won because we were the better ADC, right?
[14480.90s -> 14483.10s]  This game, it doesn't matter.
[14483.10s -> 14488.46s]  Because TF does 11k damage, doesn't ulti bot more than one time, like Rengar did
[14488.46s -> 14493.06s]  well, Gnar did well, but they also had a horrible macro.
[14493.06s -> 14500.30s]  Like it is insane to me how easy support is as a role and just how dogshit every
[14500.30s -> 14503.14s]  support player is on the server.
[14503.14s -> 14506.14s]  Your role requires zero thought.
[14506.14s -> 14512.14s]  Your thought when playing support is do I get vision or not?
[14512.14s -> 14515.76s]  If no, where can I be the most useful?
[14515.76s -> 14522.97s]  Your thought should never be this game's over, my team sucks.
[14522.97s -> 14528.55s]  It drives me ludicrous.
[14528.55s -> 14532.15s]  I'm sorry that I have to play support on this account to climb, but it's crazy how
[14532.15s -> 14536.11s]  dog shit AD Carry is when you're solo queuing in Masters.
[14536.11s -> 14540.27s]  In GM, if it's a full GM game, AD Carry is easy as fuck.
[14540.27s -> 14541.83s]  Like if everybody has a brain activity
[14541.83s -> 14544.63s]  and they're not idiots, AD Carry is amazing.
[14544.63s -> 14545.81s]  Favorite role in the game.
[14545.81s -> 14547.57s]  When you're playing with people
[14547.57s -> 14548.59s]  who don't know what they're doing
[14548.59s -> 14550.77s]  and you're actively trying to climb and improve,
[14550.77s -> 14554.03s]  it genuinely feels like I'm pulling out a ball hair
[14554.03s -> 14556.19s]  with my tweezers, or pulling out my ball hairs
[14556.19s -> 14559.39s]  with tweezers, like one by one.
[14559.39s -> 14568.90s]  It is so painful, it's crazy.
[14568.90s -> 14572.44s]  Like let's take a look at this support main right now.
[14572.44s -> 14574.88s]  97 LP negative win rate right I
[14576.08s -> 14582.18s]  Could I could literally tell that he was not a good player in the first 30 seconds of that game
[14582.48s -> 14589.81s]  I'm sorry. I'm being mean, but dude this has been driving me crazy
[14590.57s -> 14600.30s]  Like look at the way the support. I had last game also. Can I ask a question? Why am I even allowed?
[14601.06s -> 14608.76s]  Why am I even allowed to be in games with a challenger support one game? I win the game
[14608.76s -> 14621.02s]  game, then immediately it puts me in a game with a 97 LP Master Support.
[14621.02s -> 14627.97s]  What is this matchmaking?
[14627.97s -> 14634.77s]  This is insane!
[14634.77s -> 14658.10s]  That's crazy!
[14658.10s -> 14659.56s]  I don't even...
[14659.56s -> 14660.56s]  I'm wondering why...
[14660.56s -> 14667.39s]  Sorry, I'm gonna go on a rant for a second.
[14667.39s -> 14669.27s]  Why is this allowed?
[14669.27s -> 14670.91s]  Why can you be in a game?
[14670.91s -> 14675.35s]  Why can I be in a game with a literal guy who's about to promote to challenger?
[14675.35s -> 14676.49s]  Right?
[14676.49s -> 14685.02s]  We win the game, and then the very next game it puts me in a game with a guy who's 97 LP.
[14685.02s -> 14686.02s]  This is insane.
[14686.02s -> 14709.38s]  Sorry, that's just frustrating as fuck, because it's like such bad game design, right?
[14709.38s -> 14718.26s]  Like that's 900 LP difference.
[14718.26s -> 14722.90s]  And the thing is, this guy doesn't have good MMR, right?
[14722.90s -> 14728.04s]  Like it's not like this guy has good MMR, right?
[14728.04s -> 14729.78s]  Because look at his games.
[14729.78s -> 14732.06s]  He's playing with all masters players.
[14732.06s -> 14737.18s]  They're all like 100 LP masters, 70 LP, 30 LP, right?
[14737.18s -> 14738.02s]  It doesn't make sense.
[14738.02s -> 14740.30s]  It's not like his MMR is high.
[14740.30s -> 14744.86s]  So why is this guy getting into like a 600 LP grand master
[14744.86s -> 14746.42s]  game?
[14746.42s -> 14748.78s]  Why are we putting that guy in the game?
[14748.78s -> 14749.66s]  That's so frustrating.
[14749.66s -> 14757.42s]  Sorry, I just I needed to vent.
[14757.42s -> 14760.02s]  How do you know which AD carry to pick in each situation?
[14760.02s -> 14764.58s]  It's a lot of knowledge, a lot of knowledge.
[14764.58s -> 14770.66s]  you have to know a lot of shit like what the enemy champions do what your
[14770.66s -> 14775.94s]  champions need to do to to win the game what the win cons are you can just pick
[14776.98s -> 14783.30s]  and being honest though you could just pick uh like there are 80 carries in the current meta
[14783.30s -> 14786.26s]  where you can just pick their blinds like i was making a tier list i forgot about it
[14787.06s -> 14792.42s]  but i mean you can blind pick jinx pretty much every game like jinx is just blindable
[14792.42s -> 14797.78s]  every game pretty much she's insane she's super op so like if you if you ever just want to play
[14797.78s -> 14802.50s]  a champion and you think like okay i want to practice ad like jinx is insane super good um
[14805.41s -> 14810.13s]  draven's not blindable but i do think he's really good if you're good at the game
[14810.13s -> 14815.97s]  draven's very good he's he's he's harder than jinx by a mile like draven's a lot harder
[14815.97s -> 14822.94s]  but he's definitely like good at carrying with a lead as well like another blindable ad that
[14822.94s -> 14825.38s]  that I think is like A tier is like Varus.
[14825.38s -> 14827.54s]  You can blind pick Varus really easily
[14827.54s -> 14830.64s]  because Varus doesn't really have counters.
[14830.64s -> 14832.74s]  Like he doesn't get countered by anything.
[14832.74s -> 14837.18s]  He's more of like a, you can pick him and then go even
[14837.18s -> 14838.68s]  and your ulti will always be useful.
[14838.68s -> 14840.52s]  You can look to like win lane.
[14840.52s -> 14843.62s]  You can look to like engage, things like that, right?
[14868.41s -> 14871.49s]  Okay, so this game as the support,
[14871.49s -> 14875.01s]  I need to be tracking the jungler.
[14875.01s -> 14877.11s]  So I'm gonna think where,
[14877.11s -> 14880.51s]  Always be thinking what the enemy jungler wants to accomplish and how to stop it.
[14880.71s -> 14883.21s]  That's like a pretty big tip of advice that I can give you guys.
[14885.21s -> 14887.37s]  Like think to yourself, like, OK, if I was the enemy jungler,
[14887.37s -> 14889.71s]  what would I be wanting to do against the scrams, right, as Lee Sin?
[14891.41s -> 14895.05s]  He's probably going to want to either gank early, gank bot early, or he wants to
[14897.65s -> 14899.65s]  invade on certain timers, right?
[14899.65s -> 14902.67s]  Because that's like what Lee is really good at, is ganking and invading.
[14902.71s -> 14905.91s]  So what I think
[14905.91s -> 14909.31s]  I'm gonna try to do this game is I'm gonna try and
[14910.09s -> 14914.39s]  Watch for early ganks and early pressure bot lane like your level two level three ganks
[14915.07s -> 14921.25s]  We're still gonna be aggressive, but Lux took TP, which means this Lux does not plan on playing aggressive at all
[14921.83s -> 14925.11s]  like she basically if anybody takes TP like this in a lane I
[14925.99s -> 14931.91s]  Already know from start of the game that they're not planning on doing anything. So I'm probably gonna end up roaming a lot this game
[14932.47s -> 14934.47s]  This is a this is gonna be a game where I roam a ton
[14948.70s -> 14952.46s]  We do have some good lanes to roam to too. Like roaming top and mid is both really good
[14952.46s -> 14966.20s]  I just want her to ward early
[14968.14s -> 14970.14s]  Cuz I don't want to get shit on by Lee
[14971.38s -> 14973.10s]  so
[14973.10s -> 14975.10s]  Okay, I'm just gonna flash immediately
[14975.98s -> 14981.66s]  There's no reason to not flash there because Alistar used this flash to get my flash, which is totally fine
[14981.98s -> 14986.14s]  It's better for him because he has hex flash, but it's not that bad
[14990.52s -> 14993.68s]  Because I can out range him and I can stay away from his
[14994.80s -> 14997.72s]  His shit.
[14997.72s -> 15000.48s]  So we know he's in the bush, we just chill.
[15000.48s -> 15002.82s]  There it is, he fucked up, now we go forward.
[15004.52s -> 15006.36s]  I don't know why Lux isn't throwing spells at this guy,
[15006.36s -> 15008.52s]  like, I don't know why she didn't Q him.
[15009.68s -> 15012.28s]  Like, he fucked up, the Alistar should've died there.
[15013.28s -> 15015.08s]  And she's pinging me, okay.
[15015.08s -> 15016.24s]  The Alistar should've died there.
[15016.24s -> 15018.00s]  If Alistar ever fucks up on engage like that,
[15018.00s -> 15020.22s]  where he hex flashes in, gets stuck,
[15020.22s -> 15021.60s]  like, Q his cooldown,
[15021.60s -> 15023.68s]  I don't know why it was thrown is what I'm saying.
[15023.68s -> 15029.72s]  You don't throw spells that aren't gonna land.
[15029.72s -> 15031.72s]  So there's no point in Lux ever throwing her Q
[15031.72s -> 15033.40s]  until Alistar fucks up the combo.
[15034.24s -> 15035.92s]  Like she should just poke with E.
[15035.92s -> 15038.92s]  And then, because it's almost like a Blitzhook, right?
[15038.92s -> 15040.48s]  Think of it like a Blitzhook.
[15040.48s -> 15043.48s]  If she throws the Q out, right?
[15043.48s -> 15045.24s]  Now they have an opportunity to be aggressive
[15045.24s -> 15048.00s]  because they know the hook is down.
[15049.00s -> 15051.48s]  So it's better for her to just hold the hook,
[15051.48s -> 15052.38s]  essentially, right?
[15052.38s -> 15059.88s]  Hold the Q, and now when Alistar does go in, they have to be nervous about that Q because
[15059.88s -> 15063.00s]  they can't just think, oh, the Q's down, let's engage, right?
[15063.00s -> 15065.38s]  So they can't actually think about that.
[15065.38s -> 15077.39s]  This is why I don't like, a lot of the time doing this, like push, push the wave.
[15077.39s -> 15080.91s]  They can't engage on us without like flashing, so it doesn't matter.
[15080.91s -> 15090.41s]  Like look, did she Q the wave again or am I an idiot?
[15090.41s -> 15094.77s]  Just oh man. I'm losing my mind here. Oh these I'm tilting
[15095.29s -> 15101.13s]  It's fine. I need to not tilt. I need to just chill but I'm getting frustrated because we're like not using
[15101.65s -> 15103.93s]  Cool-downs properly and it's driving me fucking crazy
[15107.56s -> 15111.28s]  Because these are very simple things to do you guys got to walk the way then by the way
[15111.28s -> 15114.40s]  You can't let them freeze. Okay, they're very simple things to do
[15114.40s -> 15116.26s]  I know I'm being annoying as shit whining about this
[15116.26s -> 15119.46s]  But this is stuff that you you need to be thinking about when you're playing the game
[15119.76s -> 15121.76s]  Well, you should actively be thinking
[15123.96s -> 15130.52s]  What can I do with my champions toolkit to stop their champions toolkit and you should be thinking okay
[15130.52s -> 15132.32s]  I have Q right
[15132.32s -> 15138.12s]  So what do they want to do they want to go in? Okay, and when you're thinking they want to go in
[15140.98s -> 15146.66s]  Right, you should be thinking okay when they go in I can just Q and that should be your entire thought process
[15147.48s -> 15149.48s]  your thought process should never be oh
[15149.48s -> 15158.76s]  Oh, maybe I can land a random Q at max range and we can get a kill she queued the wave. Yes. That's what I mean like
[15159.60s -> 15163.56s]  You should never queue the wave on Lux either unless you're going to a hundred percent reset
[15165.50s -> 15171.50s]  That would be like if I hooked the wave as like blitzcrank or some shits. Why is my Lux bait pinging my graves?
[15172.20s -> 15175.68s]  Dude, I got to keep this a hundred percent honest with you, man
[15177.46s -> 15179.22s]  You don't get
[15179.22s -> 15181.22s]  You you don't get to be mad here
[15181.22s -> 15187.72s]  Why are- dude, these players are such babies.
[15187.72s -> 15189.80s]  Jesus Christ, what pussies, man.
[15189.80s -> 15193.99s]  These people are such babies.
[15193.99s -> 15197.87s]  The Graves played correctly, by the way, like 100%.
[15197.87s -> 15200.19s]  He's mad at the Graves for taking a wave.
[15200.19s -> 15204.23s]  He wanted to not- like, he wanted to be able to TP back and get the wave.
[15204.23s -> 15208.75s]  This Lux is so trash that she actually believes that it's the Graves' fault that
[15208.75s -> 15211.99s]  Graves misplayed by pushing the bot wave.
[15211.99s -> 15214.79s]  But it was the right play.
[15214.79s -> 15219.03s]  about wave was the correct play there because then she doesn't have to tp the whole reason
[15219.03s -> 15227.90s]  that he's pushing it is to save her teleport so that she doesn't have to tp the lane players
[15227.90s -> 15232.20s]  like this are why the game is hard to play right now in the current meta why it feels
[15232.20s -> 15237.14s]  bad because this lux is trash everybody you guys can all see this lux is terrible she's
[15237.14s -> 15240.52s]  already made a bunch of mistakes she's blaming her team she's being a dipshit
[15240.52s -> 15250.87s]  right but she can climb up to this elo being this bad because of the system the
[15250.87s -> 15268.57s]  the current system in place.
[15268.57s -> 15270.89s]  We should immediately do Baron here, Dragon, I mean.
[15270.89s -> 15275.11s]  We should do this.
[15275.11s -> 15275.93s]  Come.
[15276.75s -> 15278.99s]  You don't have time for this, just come do Dragon.
[15280.03s -> 15281.59s]  Bro, the Lee Sin just showed top.
[15281.59s -> 15288.17s]  We should be doing Dragon.
[15288.17s -> 15299.08s]  When this shit happens, by the way,
[15299.08s -> 15302.08s]  where you have enemy jungler shows
[15302.08s -> 15303.24s]  on one side of the map,
[15303.24s -> 15305.56s]  you should always be playing on the other side
[15305.56s -> 15307.44s]  of the map to make a counter play.
[15308.44s -> 15310.44s]  So, jungler shows on top side.
[15310.44s -> 15311.72s]  We go for Dragon.
[15311.72s -> 15312.72s]  Right?
[15312.72s -> 15317.84s]  Easy.
[15317.84s -> 15318.84s]  Yo, be careful.
[15318.84s -> 15319.84s]  Alistar's going to be there.
[15319.84s -> 15320.84s]  Xerath's going to be there.
[15320.84s -> 15321.84s]  Just leave.
[15321.84s -> 15322.84s]  Just leave.
[15322.84s -> 15325.41s]  Leave of leave.
[15325.41s -> 15326.41s]  I'll do it for you.
[15326.41s -> 15327.41s]  I'll make you leave.
[15327.41s -> 15330.36s]  I got you, man.
[15330.36s -> 15334.52s]  But we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back, and I need to back
[15334.52s -> 15338.04s]  now, but we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back.
[15338.04s -> 15348.44s]  And not only did their bot lane have to back, but the enemy was top.
[15348.44s -> 15349.44s]  I tried, man.
[15349.44s -> 15351.16s]  I tried to flash Q him.
[15351.36s -> 15359.32s]  But yeah, it's it's really I don't know a lot of junglers don't I don't think they know what they're oh, I'm dead
[15359.32s -> 15362.72s]  By the way, I'm not even gonna pop exhausts. I'm just dead a
[15363.84s -> 15370.46s]  Lot of junglers don't know what the goal of the game actually is a lot of them think it's a thousand bad insect
[15370.46s -> 15374.36s]  But a lot of junglers think the goal of the game is to like get as much farm as you can and run
[15374.36s -> 15378.48s]  Over the enemy team and shit, but it's actually it is but it's also about like
[15379.16s -> 15383.34s]  Getting early objectives and turning those small leads into big leads through objective control
[15384.08s -> 15386.52s]  Right?
[15386.52s -> 15388.96s]  So like right now, I want to rotate top.
[15388.96s -> 15392.36s]  Rift is up, I know Lee Sin is going to be on top side of the map right now.
[15392.36s -> 15397.76s]  I want to rotate top so that I can help my team by being in the top side of the map.
[15397.76s -> 15399.60s]  Because that's where the next play is going to be made.
[15399.60s -> 15406.50s]  Well the play is made mid, but I mean, I'm here so it's fine.
[15406.50s -> 15418.64s]  Oh my god.
[15418.64s -> 15423.52s]  I did not think the fucking Lee Sin would be there too.
[15423.52s -> 15429.40s]  Oh, oops.
[15429.40s -> 15430.40s]  This is rough.
[15430.40s -> 15436.32s]  really know how to how to play this because i got there in time to counter the gank right
[15437.12s -> 15441.20s]  i exhausted the guy saved the xerath i got there in time to counter the gank but
[15444.02s -> 15455.43s]  oh well played that's actually mega well played that was really good i want to push this way
[15455.43s -> 15469.60s]  then but i can't like uh you guys are noticing there's no objectives taken on the map yet at
[15469.60s -> 15471.60s]  10 minutes, which is kind of crazy
[15471.76s -> 15475.44s]  The alistar is doing really good. The alistar is not a bad support player. He's playing well
[15484.63s -> 15493.96s]  Like he's playing very well
[15493.96s -> 15498.04s]  a lot of this is more of like I need I don't have anything to do on the map because uh,
[15498.92s -> 15501.64s]  I'm trying to help my jungler, but my jungler is trolling
[15502.92s -> 15504.92s]  It's really rough
[15505.08s -> 15508.52s]  Because like i'm trying to rotate over and help my jungler on cooldown basically, right?
[15509.08s -> 15511.00s]  But my jungler doesn't want to fight
[15511.00s -> 15514.12s]  You see like i'm countering the alistar's fight or ganks. It's just
[15514.68s -> 15524.28s]  I'm just dead
[15524.28s -> 15526.28s]  dude
[15527.00s -> 15533.32s]  Like we shouldn't have made that play mid because we knew that they were all there and we knew that our jungler is doing this
[15534.68s -> 15536.98s]  This might just be a jungle diff honestly
[15538.68s -> 15542.74s]  Like our ad carry sucks, but it might just be a straight-up jungle diff game they do happen
[15544.76s -> 15548.32s]  Especially in this elo where jungle has so much control of the game they do happen
[15548.32s -> 15555.92s]  It's a pretty big jungle diff, Chipopi. You know it. I know it.
[15557.44s -> 15561.02s]  Like yeah, he's saying yeah, like he knows the jungle is getting out classed
[15562.10s -> 15568.75s]  Insanely hard because Graves counters Lee Sin. It's a massive counter
[15569.31s -> 15577.93s]  But this guy doesn't know what he's doing. I think he's a Rengar one trick and Rengar got banned
[15577.93s -> 15579.93s]  I think that's what's going on
[15581.01s -> 15585.49s]  It's a Rengar one trick who got banned out and he tried to play a champion that requires thought
[15585.49s -> 15587.93s]  Not just a I jump you die champ
[15589.09s -> 15599.28s]  Right, and he just gets shit on for it. I mean dude, I can't even I can't even do anything this game
[15600.60s -> 15610.17s]  Our top lenders getting his ass whipped too. It's really fucking rough. I mean he's in here. I'm pretty sure
[15610.87s -> 15613.19s]  It's not it was just it was warded though. I
[15614.31s -> 15616.95s]  Mean we can't really do anything here. I'm dead. I think
[15617.95s -> 15619.95s]  Yeah, I'm just dead
[15620.25s -> 15624.39s]  This is just rough. I I kind of want to go next because I don't think I
[15625.11s -> 15627.41s]  Don't think we have the skill on the team to win
[15629.19s -> 15634.27s]  The jungle diff is huge the 80 diff is huge and I'm just I can't I can't impact the map
[15647.94s -> 15651.62s]  Like I I can't I just can't do anything this game to impact the map and it feels really bad. Oh
[15662.67s -> 15670.10s]  Some of which I should have flashed. I got like creep blocked a little bit when he knocked me in I like had to
[15670.10s -> 15673.90s]  Walk through I should just flashed up. That's my man. Like what was that TP man? Oh
[15673.90s -> 15679.50s]  Oh god, get me out. I'm gonna be 100% real. Get me out. That TP was miserably bad.
[15680.46s -> 15695.00s]  Dude just TP'd to the wave. Like what is our Lux doing too? Like I just feel like everybody's
[15695.00s -> 15702.12s]  late to the fights. Lux is always late to the fights. The Graves doesn't want to take fights
[15702.12s -> 15707.16s]  even though he's playing Graves into Lee Sin. Like I feel like, oh this is rough. This is a
[15707.16s -> 15712.36s]  a rough game. Games like this tilt me and I kind of just want to go next. Because games like this,
[15713.00s -> 15715.80s]  they are winnable, but I feel like I want to go next to save mental, you know?
[15716.84s -> 15730.92s]  Like low key, I just want to save my mental. Because oh, that's so gross.
[15732.60s -> 15737.24s]  Like watching what Lux did in the early stages of the lane phase, just wasting her Q on repeat,
[15737.24s -> 15740.92s]  that was one of the most embarrassing things ever. And then like, look at that, she just
[15740.92s -> 15753.32s]  Just queued a minion.
[15753.32s -> 15759.53s]  Bro, like, oh my god.
[15759.53s -> 15764.57s]  You gotta push the wave, man.
[15764.57s -> 15768.84s]  Holy shit.
[15768.84s -> 15776.18s]  I mean, I can't even walk.
[15776.18s -> 15779.18s]  Oh my god.
[15779.18s -> 15783.18s]  I don't even have help from my fucking team.
[15783.18s -> 15786.18s]  That's the worst part about this.
[15786.18s -> 15788.18s]  Aww.
[15788.18s -> 15793.18s]  Dude, these games feel so unplayable, man.
[15793.18s -> 15797.14s]  Like I don't know how else to say it except for they just feel miserable to play
[15798.02s -> 15806.02s]  like I'm trying to focus on playing like improving myself, but it's so hard to know how to improve in games where like
[15807.94s -> 15809.94s]  You genuinely just
[15810.08s -> 15811.82s]  Get no help
[15811.82s -> 15824.11s]  My locks has been tilted since like minute two for some reason and my graves has been completely pathing wrong doing wrong shit
[15824.65s -> 15827.07s]  It's hard to know how to help like I went mid to help
[15827.53s -> 15829.53s]  countered two of the early ganks
[15829.71s -> 15831.71s]  Lux still griefed the game
[15831.71s -> 15836.44s]  So like yeah, it's just it's hard to know and then top lane lost
[15839.68s -> 15841.68s]  It's so rough, man
[15845.83s -> 15851.67s]  Like I'm gonna keep it a hundred percent honest with you. If you are a one trick, do not try and play other champs
[15853.15s -> 15854.83s]  You you will int
[15854.83s -> 15862.82s]  you will play badly always and you will int and you will you will
[15863.34s -> 15865.34s]  Like look at this. This is
[15865.54s -> 15867.62s]  2.9 K damage as a
[15867.62s -> 15875.44s]  Dude, like what are we doing? How are these people getting into this elo?
[15876.24s -> 15884.06s]  How does this locks like in the game? She was against an Alistar bot and she did one point
[15884.94s -> 15887.68s]  2.9 K damage in a 16 minute game
[15888.44s -> 15890.44s]  Against a melee heavy team
[15891.76s -> 15893.76s]  Like what is this what is happening?
[15894.86s -> 15903.09s]  This guy was d4 30 LP last season and now he's magically in Masters
[15903.09s -> 15910.69s]  No, we need to fix matchmaking.
[15910.69s -> 15911.69s]  This is insane.
[15911.69s -> 15918.98s]  Like, this is just a matchmaking diff.
[15918.98s -> 15920.90s]  It's nothing else.
[15920.90s -> 15927.64s]  My man literally does not belong in Master Tier 400 LP MMR at all.
[15927.64s -> 15929.38s]  You can see that he's not at this level.
[15929.38s -> 15948.75s]  Dude, I have the Lux player on my team again?
[15948.75s -> 15949.75s]  Ugh.
[15949.75s -> 15962.03s]  There's a Xerath one trick and a Rengar one trick on the enemy team.
[15962.03s -> 15963.83s]  I don't know, man.
[15963.83s -> 15970.76s]  I guess I care more about the Rengar than the Xerath, but this is rough.
[15970.76s -> 15984.35s]  Oh, what's up, Chpapi?
[15984.35s -> 15986.43s]  Dude, sorry I hit yes on that, man.
[15986.43s -> 15989.99s]  I know the game was winnable, I'm going to be real, but dude, you didn't see what
[15989.99s -> 15993.35s]  I saw during the early game of that game, Chpapi.
[15993.35s -> 16002.62s]  Like man, the entire early game of that game was like, we lost lane because Lux
[16002.62s -> 16009.50s]  wouldn't use her Q to fight the Alistar, she was using it to farm minions.
[16009.50s -> 16014.10s]  Like she was so scared of being engaged on by the Alistar and the Kalista that she would
[16014.10s -> 16018.98s]  use her Q to max range farm minions instead of save it.
[16018.98s -> 16023.06s]  So when the Alistar engages, we just kill him, right?
[16023.06s -> 16026.62s]  Because if Alistar ever engages on me and Lux, he just gets killed.
[16026.62s -> 16030.36s]  We just bind him, walk away and he's stuck there and he dies, right?
[16030.36s -> 16035.40s]  But for some reason she didn't understand how to do that.
[16035.40s -> 16036.70s]  So she was just throwing it to farm.
[16036.70s -> 16038.40s]  So we would just get engaged on.
[16038.40s -> 16042.14s]  I started roaming and every time I was like roaming to an objective or something
[16042.14s -> 16047.40s]  The graves would always walk away and not fight like he wasn't attempting to fight
[16047.40s -> 16049.62s]  He was basically just like oh, I'm gonna go farm some more
[16049.66s -> 16051.36s]  But I'm like dude, you can't do that
[16051.36s -> 16056.48s]  Like if the Alistar is ganking mid and I'm countering mid you can't just farm farm before coming mid or you can't just like
[16056.48s -> 16061.64s]  Not take dragon and shuttling that right like it blows my mind that these players can get like it's like this guy
[16061.64s -> 16064.20s]  Too same thing like that jungler last game, right?
[16064.20s -> 16069.24s]  Look at this, it's the same thing as the last game, like NA is riddled with this shit and
[16069.24s -> 16070.92s]  it's so miserable to play.
[16070.92s -> 16072.80s]  Look at this, this jungler last game, right?
[16072.80s -> 16074.80s]  He's not, he's what, like a D1 player, right?
[16074.80s -> 16076.64s]  He's not a bad player, he peaked D1.
[16076.64s -> 16078.60s]  But why is this guy in this game now?
[16078.60s -> 16083.16s]  He like artificially inflated to this elo, getting lucky with his first few games,
[16083.16s -> 16084.56s]  and now we have to play with this guy.
[16084.56s -> 16089.15s]  Oh, it's an account share.
[16089.15s -> 16092.75s]  The person, it's a different player, look.
[16092.75s -> 16095.03s]  On the account.
[16095.03s -> 16098.52s]  D flash, F flash.
[16098.52s -> 16103.21s]  So, it's a fucking account share.
[16103.21s -> 16112.18s]  That's frustrating.
[16112.18s -> 16113.62s]  Sorry for whining so much, guys.
[16113.62s -> 16115.78s]  This shit's just really frustrating to me.
[16116.78s -> 16118.22s]  Like, I know I should play it to, like,
[16118.22s -> 16120.72s]  specifically only care about, like, improving,
[16120.72s -> 16121.84s]  and then while you're improving,
[16121.84s -> 16123.74s]  you'll climb automatically and shit,
[16123.74s -> 16125.78s]  but it's really frustrating when, like,
[16127.42s -> 16129.82s]  the players in the game would rather be idiots
[16129.82s -> 16131.94s]  and assholes to each other than play the game.
[16131.94s -> 16134.22s]  Right, like, the game before, the Amumu, right?
[16134.22s -> 16137.32s]  the game before this the amumu was just being toxic the whole game and into the
[16137.32s -> 16140.96s]  win away the last game the Lux and the graves were being toxic to each other
[16140.96s -> 16147.44s]  the whole game we entered the game away it's like I it's it's not fun to lose
[16147.44s -> 16151.44s]  because one player gets mad at another player over them both being idiots
[16151.44s -> 16160.61s]  I'm sorry it's not fun it's so unfun but we'll try and we'll try and
[16160.61s -> 16177.34s]  win this one all we can really do is try and carry the games right it's
[16177.34s -> 16194.70s]  about it what is what what man what what do you think they're gonna do to me
[16194.70s -> 16198.56s]  welcome to the league of y'all take it with the seven months man welcome back
[16198.56s -> 16201.94s]  be passed like I really don't want to meet all I don't I don't want to meet
[16201.94s -> 16217.29s]  all because like I want to like value the pings and shit but dude if they
[16217.29s -> 16254.34s]  walk up I'm gonna flank them that's why I'm standing here that's a big queue
[16254.34s -> 16257.48s]  I need to get level two first here hundred percent
[16257.48s -> 16278.23s]  Ash should have just been autoing there that whole time
[16279.97s -> 16282.85s]  Because we have heal so she should have just walked up and autoed
[16283.17s -> 16288.35s]  As soon as this is what I mean by tracking cooldowns as soon as the Nico missed her
[16288.57s -> 16290.57s]  As soon as the Nico missed her cooldown
[16290.69s -> 16295.67s]  So she missed her E. The Ash should have just walked up and immediately started fighting
[16296.87s -> 16303.97s]  Right, like because they can no longer kill us the Nico doesn't actually have spells outside of her E
[16304.61s -> 16309.43s]  Right. So if she misses that snare and she used her W to right so it's like we just go ham
[16309.89s -> 16317.15s]  You don't need to be too scared. It happens quite a bit sometimes where people will just be like really nervous
[16335.08s -> 16338.68s]  Damn if I had dodged that Q, I actually would have killed all three
[16339.32s -> 16344.56s]  Damn, I don't know if it was worth the flash after the guy. I think it was if I had dodged the Q
[16344.56s -> 16346.16s]  I would have been fine
[16346.16s -> 16352.04s]  So that was that it's whatever. I also doesn't miss any creeps here. So it's not the end of the world
[16356.53s -> 16359.49s]  I'm pretty sure Lee Sin did not have his top camps, by the way.
[16366.85s -> 16369.37s]  Damn, if I was a little better mechanically, I turned that, by the way.
[16370.81s -> 16374.08s]  100 percent.
[16374.08s -> 16377.48s]  We should push this wave so that I can go get vision.
[16397.94s -> 16400.02s]  Because, yeah, that guy can't freeze that wave.
[16400.02s -> 16416.29s]  So it's not too bad.
[16416.29s -> 16425.03s]  Lee Sin's top.
[16425.03s -> 16431.45s]  You can kind of see some really good.
[16431.45s -> 16433.13s]  What is this?
[16433.13s -> 16439.38s]  Why is my Karthus AFK at turret?
[16439.38s -> 16453.94s]  What is happening right now?
[16453.94s -> 16470.34s]  Why was he afk? I mean, I guess it worked out. But yeah, maybe he had to go let his cat out and I don't know
[16472.74s -> 16481.86s]  Happens we do their bot lane is not very good
[16483.22s -> 16485.30s]  They're trying too hard to force fights that they can't win
[16489.84s -> 16492.48s]  Like they they genuinely can't win half these fights that they're trying to force
[16494.00s -> 16498.24s]  Maybe if they were against people who like don't push their buttons they could win those but it's like all I have to do
[16498.24s -> 16500.24s]  Is stand there and fight back and they lose
[16500.80s -> 16502.80s]  They're on dragon a thousand percent right now
[16503.10s -> 16505.10s]  There's not a lot I can do about that
[16505.86s -> 16512.26s]  We just have to chill. There's almost nothing I can do about it Kaisa is trying to fake act like she's big but it's
[16515.77s -> 16517.77s]  There's just nothing we can do
[16519.26s -> 16529.19s]  Because our car this is top. So we just chill they finished the cheerless. No, no, no, not yet
[16530.53s -> 16533.89s]  Whoa
[16533.89s -> 16535.89s]  Lisa could be bought right now
[16535.89s -> 16541.91s]  I don't think it's too bad if he's bought though. They can't really dive us especially with card assaults
[16542.53s -> 16559.10s]  Why why does my ash just run?
[16560.20s -> 16567.74s]  She like just straight-up runs away. It's kind of silly
[16576.86s -> 16581.62s]  Cuz we have we have card this ulti like we can win at five. All right, we can win a fight bot right now
[16581.62s -> 16588.80s]  I guess I guess I'm just gonna have to get them low enough for car this to kill them
[16590.36s -> 16592.52s]  Like without the ashes help
[16593.68s -> 16595.68s]  Which I think I can do it's not too bad
[16595.84s -> 16599.15s]  Okay, the Akali's coming bot
[16600.43s -> 16612.74s]  We just killed him. I mean, let's just fight. I don't know why we should just Ashe arrow honestly
[16613.54s -> 16621.45s]  Just Ashe arrow
[16621.45s -> 16623.45s]  Okay, that was pretty bad Ashe arrow, but
[16630.54s -> 16633.64s]  Filled I don't think he's filled. I think he's just having a bad game
[16635.02s -> 16637.02s]  Like I think it happens, you know
[16637.58s -> 16642.50s]  Whoa, okay
[16642.50s -> 16644.66s]  Do it ult me. I fucking dare you
[16645.38s -> 16651.12s]  I'm trying to keep some mana
[16651.48s -> 16653.48s]  So that I can ulti
[16667.06s -> 16677.38s]  Carthus already used his ults. Fuck. They both backed there? Wow
[16678.26s -> 16684.22s]  My bad. I honestly didn't think they were both gonna back there
[16684.86s -> 16689.60s]  Like I thought the Kai'Sa was gonna back right where I saw her like last
[16690.68s -> 16692.48s]  That was my bad
[16692.48s -> 16694.48s]  mmm, I should be I
[16694.84s -> 16696.84s]  Think Lee Sin can come bot here and kill me. I
[16699.84s -> 16701.84s]  Should actually stop this guy's back
[16706.55s -> 16712.41s]  Yeah, I should stop his back because it's more value to stop the back now. Even if Lee Sin isn't bot it's more value
[16712.41s -> 16716.89s]  Because he's so low.
[16716.89s -> 16720.85s]  Kali is mia though, so we gotta be careful.
[16720.85s -> 16724.29s]  I wasted my ult though, which makes me kinda scared.
[16724.29s -> 16727.05s]  The other thing that kinda sucks about this is we don't have good vision.
[16727.05s -> 16737.15s]  And I can't really help anybody on the map because the same thing is happening as
[16737.15s -> 16738.15s]  before.
[16738.15s -> 16745.16s]  We're like, we're missing opportunities to get kills on timers.
[16745.16s -> 16747.36s]  I mean the dog lightning guy is playing fine this game.
[16747.36s -> 16748.60s]  I think he's trolled a lot.
[16748.60s -> 16751.08s]  He's he's trolling. This isn't like his best game
[16752.20s -> 16756.36s]  But it's also I don't know why we're getting so tilted around the map right now
[16756.96s -> 16759.92s]  Because if I'm if I'm being honest, we should just win the game off of like
[16761.48s -> 16781.15s]  Being better players. I don't know what this car this is thinking but do it do it
[16782.23s -> 16784.23s]  Hard this we can fight we can fight just fight
[16784.71s -> 16789.04s]  Bro, what are we doing?
[16789.04s -> 16795.68s]  I'm losing it man. Ah, no, no, no. I'm tilted. I'm tilted as fuck. He didn't walk in
[16795.68s -> 16798.68s]  Just go onto the Akali shroud, man
[16800.12s -> 16804.16s]  Like just walk a foot to your right and stand on the Akali shroud
[16804.64s -> 16808.68s]  She just eats your damage like while she's in the shroud. She can't stop that
[16812.67s -> 16814.67s]  Holy shit. I'm losing my minds
[16816.64s -> 16820.80s]  Like Ash is just inting bot waves right now not trying to do anything
[16820.80s -> 16822.80s]  I'm losing it, man.
[16822.80s -> 16825.80s]  Like, we see exactly where they are every game.
[16825.80s -> 16828.80s]  Like, we see where everybody is on the enemy team permanently,
[16828.80s -> 16831.80s]  and we still can't manage to, like, walk to the right location.
[16831.80s -> 16833.80s]  This is driving me crazy.
[16833.80s -> 16838.80s]  My Karthus jungle is getting out-farmed.
[16838.80s -> 16843.82s]  Like, a Karthus jungle is getting out-farmed by a Lee Sin jungle.
[16843.82s -> 16845.82s]  That's insane.
[16845.82s -> 16848.82s]  Like, I don't think they're going to be able to do that.
[16848.82s -> 16853.58s]  Lee Sin jungle that's insane like I don't think I don't think I can stress
[16853.58s -> 16859.24s]  enough how crazy that is like there should never be a world where
[16859.24s -> 16870.57s]  Karthus ever gets out farms no way I'm dead dude no way I just fucking ate
[16870.57s -> 16885.16s]  the end of that now I'm playing that just kill the Lee Sin man I fucked up
[16885.16s -> 16890.56s]  there that was my fault cuz I got hit by the tip of the that was my
[16890.56s -> 16894.40s]  I got barely clipped by the tip of the Neeko ults when I was trying to space cuz I'm bad
[16895.24s -> 16898.56s]  And if I was alive there and I could have saved my flash for the Lee Sin Q
[16898.56s -> 16905.25s]  We just win I am confused that why we decided to like not fight that immediately though
[16906.29s -> 16909.93s]  Like we caught out two of their members and we just got scared for whatever reason
[16910.41s -> 16912.25s]  Wait, we win this fight
[16912.25s -> 16914.33s]  We thousand percent win this fight this fight this fight this
[16928.66s -> 16931.26s]  Bro, do not throw a fucking temper tantrum right now
[16931.86s -> 16934.66s]  There's one kill do not throw a temper tantrum
[16938.19s -> 16940.19s]  My god, here we go. I
[16940.51s -> 16943.11s]  Took one kill the guys about to lose his mind guys. I
[16951.60s -> 16954.44s]  Need to mute all I'm gonna mute all in a second
[16955.72s -> 16958.10s]  Like I I can't with these people right now
[16958.76s -> 16963.44s]  Like I can't man. You people are disgusting
[16964.64s -> 16966.64s]  like you guys just
[16966.64s -> 16971.32s]  Wine you play bad you whine and you bitch about every little mistake that everything happens
[16971.48s -> 16975.28s]  even though it's like in the middle of a fight I guarantee I'm a better player than you are and
[16975.28s -> 16978.56s]  And you're still whining and crying over one shutdown that like
[16979.06s -> 16985.30s]  You didn't even walk to until I spam pinged you like I literally 1v2 them you hit 1e and now you're mad
[16985.78s -> 16990.99s]  Dude, I swear league players are fucking psychopaths
[16991.65s -> 16998.45s]  At least I got the exhaust off surely she dies, right?
[16999.19s -> 17002.17s]  Surely she dies here or not. Okay
[17003.35s -> 17005.35s]  Okay, at least she died
[17005.99s -> 17007.99s]  Help each other guys
[17008.59s -> 17014.48s]  Help each other teamwork teamwork teamwork teamwork teamwork
[17019.47s -> 17021.47s]  Wait, this ash is insane
[17025.77s -> 17031.07s]  Okay, I'm not gonna lie that ash played that so good. I only saw the end of it and she still played that good
[17032.49s -> 17034.49s]  That was sick
[17035.25s -> 17037.29s]  Well done that was actually really good
[17038.01s -> 17041.90s]  She almost stopped the dive
[17042.14s -> 17052.48s]  That's crazy. This game is definitely 1000% still winnable though. We just have to play
[17053.40s -> 17059.46s]  Poor late game and not lose our fucking minds. I'll let that push back into my ash. I'll go mid and get some vision
[17062.24s -> 17064.24s]  That's pretty much all we have to do
[17064.70s -> 17075.50s]  Play for late and not lose our mind early. We could play to kill this Akali right now. She doesn't know there's no ward here
[17076.82s -> 17082.95s]  We could also invade here. Oh, that's so unlucky
[17084.35s -> 17091.70s]  That was such a close cue kill that guy
[17113.82s -> 17120.85s]  Jesus Christ. I feel like we should have won that fight
[17122.03s -> 17124.03s]  I felt like something awkward happened and we lost
[17124.99s -> 17127.39s]  Did my ash just walk directly into the sakali?
[17128.03s -> 17131.71s]  And not use her ulti use your ulti you have ulti use your ulti
[17132.51s -> 17141.90s]  Oh my god
[17142.06s -> 17145.29s]  What the fuck?
[17145.29s -> 17147.29s]  Oh, oh my god
[17148.65s -> 17150.65s]  I don't even know what to say right now
[17151.77s -> 17153.77s]  This is insane
[17154.49s -> 17159.29s]  This genuinely feels like everybody in the game is losing their mind in the freest game i've ever seen in my life
[17163.58s -> 17169.82s]  Like that's what we're losing to right there that guy the guy who like doesn't understand how Senna works
[17170.42s -> 17174.14s]  Like that player. That's why I'm frustrated like that player right there
[17175.02s -> 17178.38s]  Has no idea how Senna works tries to fight me
[17179.22s -> 17181.22s]  And we're like losing to that guy
[17181.42s -> 17185.60s]  Like I'm trying really hard not to be an asshole, but like it's flooding out right now from these games
[17185.60s -> 17193.08s]  i only have to say thanks to that person for keeping me on my toes
[17193.08s -> 17201.86s]  it's crazy. He's so toxic. Look at this. He went proto-belt, Ionia Boot, Nico, but that
[17201.86s -> 17223.70s]  doesn't do anything to help his team. You could aero that guy, I mean it's not impossible.
[17223.70s -> 17237.61s]  Or don't. That's fine. Oh my god.
[17237.61s -> 17250.37s]  Guys, I think my Lux is AFK. She's been sitting in base for like 5 minutes.
[17250.37s -> 17257.65s]  I think she's like
[17258.41s -> 17260.41s]  Literally just throwing there some fits
[17261.05s -> 17262.85s]  Let's push this wave
[17262.85s -> 17275.18s]  We could make a pick right now
[17280.18s -> 17283.30s]  Jax, what are you doing man? Why are you up there? Oh, no
[17283.90s -> 17288.67s]  Also, why does this ash have the worst build I've ever seen
[17289.29s -> 17298.66s]  Dude, if we lose to the Kaisa that just did that I'm gonna lose my mind
[17299.46s -> 17318.54s]  Wait, I just blind art in without any vision of anybody and just died
[17319.34s -> 17321.34s]  There's just no way we can lose this
[17321.58s -> 17326.24s]  We got this guys just play
[17326.48s -> 17334.31s]  Like I just need to I need help getting vision control on Baron and mid and then we can we can win
[17335.19s -> 17336.75s]  We got this
[17336.75s -> 17418.67s]  Right now. I mean we still got Baron, but he did get two of them. I guess
[17419.19s -> 17423.02s]  Or no, we only yeah, you got car this in ash
[17424.38s -> 17436.47s]  But we did get Baron which is very nice. I'm gonna go Dom's this game. I'm gonna go
[17436.47s -> 17438.47s]  Oh
[17439.11s -> 17441.11s]  Black cleaver, but I think i'm gonna go doms
[17453.82s -> 17457.34s]  I need to get vision control on dragon and mid
[17470.63s -> 17473.27s]  I need to get vision control and I need I need help to do it though
[17474.63s -> 17476.63s]  I'm gonna act like i'm backing here
[17483.88s -> 17486.60s]  We should just be pushing mid with baron. I don't know what we're doing
[17488.36s -> 17491.32s]  Like like low key it should just be straight up like we go mid with baron here
[17503.03s -> 17505.03s]  The fuck was that that was a terrible play
[17505.59s -> 17536.06s]  Guys just just come mid we have Baron nice huge pick push mid push mid
[17537.34s -> 17546.88s]  Fuck dragon just push mid. Okay. Now we back off. Oh
[17551.32s -> 17553.32s]  I mean that was
[17553.92s -> 17555.08s]  Bad
[17555.08s -> 17562.18s]  Guys back off back off back off leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf leaf, please. Please just leave
[17566.28s -> 17569.28s]  Guys, you can leave you can leave we just go to dragon leaf
[17570.04s -> 17575.90s]  We still have so much gold to get on the map. We can go get bot tier two
[17576.66s -> 17578.66s]  bot tier one bot tier two
[17579.42s -> 17581.72s]  We have we have so much gold to go on the map. It's not a big deal, right?
[17581.72s -> 17584.12s]  Like we don't need to end the game right the seconds.
[17584.12s -> 17588.42s]  We actually have Carthus and we have Jax too.
[17588.42s -> 17620.12s]  So like our scaling is really good.
[17620.12s -> 17639.00s]  I need to go get I need to go get my next item, but I need enough gold to do it.
[17639.00s -> 17641.20s]  I also need to get wards.
[17641.20s -> 17645.50s]  This sucks. I'm like a weird by timer where I don't have enough things to get.
[17645.50s -> 17648.40s]  You know what? I'm just going to get my ward item.
[17648.40s -> 17651.28s]  I'm gonna grab this for right now, just so we can actually get some power on the map.
[17652.16s -> 17657.04s]  Because the map's so dark, you know, I think getting the ward item before finishing my last whisper item's probably the smartest call.
[17662.38s -> 17666.78s]  I am a little concerned why we're not pushing bot with Jax, we're pushing top.
[17668.74s -> 17674.54s]  And I'm also concerned why we're not playing for mid-Prio, and we're just farming bot side.
[17676.18s -> 17677.90s]  This is such an awkward fucking thing.
[17684.38s -> 17687.26s]  Like, we should just be playing for mid-Prio and use arrow to engage.
[17687.26s -> 17690.38s]  That's how we win. We just use arrow to engage when they contest mid
[17691.18s -> 17693.18s]  It's actually that easy
[17693.18s -> 17701.36s]  Like low-key. It's actually that easy
[17701.80s -> 17718.67s]  See watch now this guy's dead. I mean, that's fine with me
[17720.17s -> 17722.33s]  You guys want to int to kill me that's totally fine
[17723.33s -> 17738.12s]  They can get the inhib and then they can back up
[17739.30s -> 17743.84s]  Yeah, yeah get inhib back up and then play for Baron
[17744.34s -> 17748.66s]  They'll only have a few seconds to do this though
[17748.66s -> 17751.26s]  So it's kind of scary because these two are gonna be alive
[17757.23s -> 17759.23s]  They need to back immediately
[17759.67s -> 17765.99s]  Just reset. You don't need the wave. Just leave leave leave
[17766.67s -> 17769.03s]  Barons up burns up think about the macro guys the macro
[17769.85s -> 17773.70s]  We play for Baron now
[17773.70s -> 17780.14s]  Because there's a timer now where like you guys just need to reset because there's a timer where the enemy has tempo on the map
[17780.14s -> 17782.14s]  and if we don't
[17782.70s -> 17784.70s]  If we don't allow
[17785.30s -> 17788.46s]  If we don't reset they'll just rush Baron and there's nothing we do about it
[17789.10s -> 17802.89s]  Okay, they're not on Baron. I think they missed their timer. They're on it. No, they're on it. They're on it
[17805.38s -> 17812.79s]  Okay, they're not on it. We're fun
[17812.79s -> 17815.01s]  We can still fight this though, but we need everybody here
[17815.63s -> 17826.86s]  Just arrow arrow ash arrow arrow arrow. It doesn't matter if you hit mouth. Just arrow
[17827.58s -> 17829.74s]  Just arrow him. Thank you
[17830.72s -> 17838.00s]  No, guys the back line the back line
[17840.88s -> 17842.88s]  Play together play together. Yes
[17845.22s -> 17848.82s]  nice
[17848.82s -> 17850.18s]  end of the game
[17850.18s -> 17854.07s]  You end you end here
[17854.47s -> 17856.27s]  Lux don't back
[17856.27s -> 17859.19s]  You are giving me cancer. Okay, they forfeit it, dude
[17859.19s -> 17865.89s]  Look how easy that is look how easy it is to win games when people are listening to macro. Look how easy it is
[17865.89s -> 17867.89s]  Oh my god
[17868.85s -> 17873.57s]  I'm losing it man. I swear to god. I'm losing my I can feel my hair falling out right now
[17873.57s -> 17878.91s]  I can feel it falling out of my fucking head like I just lost the one that's right there. Look like it's just
[17878.91s -> 17880.91s]  fucking kill me man
[17880.91s -> 17882.91s]  in game
[17882.91s -> 17884.91s]  god
[17884.91s -> 17886.91s]  it's so hard
[17886.91s -> 17888.91s]  i feel so exhausted
[17888.91s -> 17895.10s]  like it's so exhausting
[17895.10s -> 17897.10s]  you played a 44 minute gold game
[17897.10s -> 17899.10s]  god damn
[17899.10s -> 17904.34s]  that's impressive
[17904.34s -> 17906.34s]  i don't want to honor any of these people
[17906.34s -> 17908.34s]  who would you guys honor
[17908.34s -> 17910.34s]  like out of all of them who would you guys pick
[17910.34s -> 17912.34s]  cause i don't know they all suck
[17912.34s -> 17917.06s]  in my eyes i'm too toxic right now they all suck
[17917.06s -> 17923.01s]  Jax. Ash. Ash was trying. I'll give you that. Ash was trying.
[17926.86s -> 17929.26s]  Dude, look at this Lux.
[17929.26s -> 17931.56s]  This Lux got so fucking carried.
[17931.56s -> 17939.75s]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
[17941.11s -> 17944.85s]  Don't type to me, you pedestrian.
[17948.87s -> 17951.21s]  This man called him a pedestrian.
[17959.30s -> 17961.90s]  That's not even an insult.
[17961.90s -> 17964.16s]  Like, oh, yeah. Yeah. Wow.
[17964.16s -> 17988.12s]  Fucking pedestrian like it's not even an insult man, dude
[17989.76s -> 17992.94s]  Guys I feel like part of my life gets taken away, you know
[17994.60s -> 17998.00s]  Like when I play on my main account, I'm like super sweaty try harding and shit
[17998.00s -> 18001.88s]  I feel like I feel like I'm losing like yeah, it's like it's like every time I lose
[18001.88s -> 18005.44s]  It's like one hair or like every time I'm like barely win, right?
[18005.44s -> 18009.92s]  It's just like every game in this ELO is like one hair on my head gets fucking burnt out
[18009.92s -> 18012.72s]  And it just leaves and I'm not like I'm be looking like Homer Simpson
[18032.31s -> 18037.45s]  Like look at the difference in wards place. This is what annoys me about bad support players
[18038.19s -> 18040.19s]  This guy placed 23
[18041.07s -> 18044.75s]  He's more focused on getting kills than placing wards and it's really stupid
[18050.90s -> 18052.42s]  Sorry, I just don't listen
[18052.42s -> 18057.82s]  I don't have anything against the dog lightning guy as a person other than like what I've seen on his stream, right?
[18058.14s -> 18061.28s]  Like honest stream. He just seems really egotistical
[18061.28s -> 18066.28s]  justbask2official Yeah, I'm
[18066.28s -> 18068.28s]  pretty sure that's a very
[18068.28s -> 18070.28s]  statistical like he's he's like
[18070.28s -> 18072.28s]  everything I hate in the average
[18072.28s -> 18074.28s]  league player. He's he has a
[18074.28s -> 18077.28s]  massive ego because he reached
[18077.28s -> 18078.28s]  challenger on the support role
[18078.28s -> 18080.28s]  on like an off meta pick like
[18080.28s -> 18081.28s]  last year at some point or
[18081.28s -> 18082.28s]  something or maybe he's
[18082.28s -> 18084.66s]  challenged right now. I don't
[18084.66s -> 18086.66s]  even know maybe he has an
[18086.66s -> 18087.66s]  account in challenger. I don't
[18087.66s -> 18089.66s]  even know, but it drives me
[18089.66s -> 18091.66s]  crazy because like he doesn't
[18091.66s -> 18096.66s]  winz lane because he plays extremely aggressively but if you guys noticed in
[18096.66s -> 18099.70s]  that game the reason we won lane or where we were able to push back is
[18099.70s -> 18104.82s]  because they played aggressively but they did it really stupidly like they
[18104.82s -> 18108.62s]  were fighting us in our own waves right like on repeat they were just
[18108.62s -> 18112.14s]  fighting us in our own waves every time I would just turn a one for one
[18112.14s -> 18115.78s]  almost a one for two every time and it's it's stupid because every time
[18115.78s -> 18118.74s]  that's happening they're also giving me souls right and he would like take
[18118.74s -> 18123.62s]  weird fights and like I know he's probably for fun and he doesn't care it's a smurf blah blah blah
[18123.62s -> 18128.42s]  but I just don't like when people like that like ego their ass off when they play so badly
[18129.70s -> 18160.30s]  it drives me crazy why do I care so much I don't know I don't know how are you guys doing by the
[18160.30s -> 18165.90s]  way how's everybody's day going in chat what you guys up to talk to me I know I stopped
[18165.90s -> 18169.98s]  like teaching the game and started whining like I got on my main account a few hours ago
[18169.98s -> 18172.30s]  And I stopped teaching and I started whining a bunch. So
[18174.78s -> 18178.37s]  My bad
[18178.37s -> 18180.21s]  My bad on that one dudes
[18180.21s -> 18182.21s]  How you guys doing now? How's everybody's day gone?
[18189.46s -> 18192.74s]  When the coaching service is open. Oh, I could probably do coaching
[18193.86s -> 18195.86s]  at some point soon
[18195.94s -> 18199.94s]  like i'd be willing to do some coaching some like sub coaching or something or like
[18200.58s -> 18211.76s]  Something like that. It might be fun
[18211.76s -> 18214.72s]  Sucking in bronze, you don't get enough time to actually improve dude. I feel that man
[18215.04s -> 18219.20s]  It takes a long time league is not an easy game to pick up and start playing right?
[18219.20s -> 18223.28s]  But if you're in bronze or silver and you're like, oh, I actually am having fun playing
[18223.28s -> 18225.72s]  the game, I kind of want to try and get better.
[18225.72s -> 18229.56s]  You're just overwhelmed with so much info that you have to play so many games.
[18229.56s -> 18230.56s]  Right?
[18230.56s -> 18236.13s]  Like I feel you, man.
[18236.13s -> 18237.13s]  It's overwhelming.
[18237.13s -> 18246.10s]  Yeah.
[18246.10s -> 18247.10s]  I feel you.
[18247.10s -> 18256.20s]  Well, we got mid.
[18256.20s -> 18257.20s]  Okay.
[18257.20s -> 18258.20s]  Should I just play Trist?
[18258.20s -> 18267.84s]  Well, I'm worried if I pick Trist that we won't have AP, but I also think I'm
[18267.84s -> 18282.03s]  better at Trist than I am at like other stuff so I don't know. AP Varus? I'm not
[18282.03s -> 18289.24s]  good enough at AP Varus man I'm gonna be real. Well my Malz is good but the
[18289.24s -> 18292.94s]  problem with Malz is like Malz is a shitty champion like Malz is trash
[18292.94s -> 18299.20s]  right so like he's good but he's like not good in the sense of like I can
[18299.20s -> 18303.76s]  play him well but at the end of the day if they pick something that like
[18303.76s -> 18312.34s]  counter's mouths I just lose whereas like Tristana is just free to pick like
[18312.34s -> 18316.26s]  even if we play all ad right let's say we do all ad or some shit like on
[18316.26s -> 18319.86s]  accidents or because people are one tricks blah blah blah it's it's still
[18319.86s -> 18324.62s]  free like Tristana is still like a good pick because even with all ad she's
[18324.62s -> 18329.22s]  still like you can build Lord Dom's she has incredibly high pressure early
[18329.22s -> 18332.76s]  game if you play her right right like you could push the waves roam you can
[18332.76s -> 18339.40s]  You can roam top, roam bot, help lanes out like level 2-3. You can evade junglers early. Like she's just incredibly incredibly strong
[18341.55s -> 18343.55s]  This guy should go pike
[18344.03s -> 18349.39s]  I was gonna say they picked Nunu and I picked an AD mid. They picked Nunu and Thresh
[18350.35s -> 18352.35s]  We should have an engage
[18352.35s -> 18357.55s]  Because because pike trist like I can just walk bot on repeat now and pretty much kill people
[18367.96s -> 18372.04s]  Watch an iron game watching an iron game. I feel like it wouldn't be an actual iron game though, would it?
[18372.04s -> 18382.65s]  I've heard, I had friends who like intentionally lost a bunch of games, uh, and so they could
[18382.65s -> 18383.85s]  get to iron four, right?
[18383.85s -> 18388.73s]  They like, they like into down to iron four or whatever, to see if they could make it.
[18388.73s -> 18396.45s]  And uh, there's just so many like smurfs in iron.
[18396.45s -> 18402.17s]  There's like legitimate bot, bot accounts, like, like accounts that are like being
[18402.17s -> 18407.05s]  botted right there's like bottom that counts an iron there's like smurfs all over the place
[18415.72s -> 18420.04s]  it seems to have stopped i wonder if riot like did something that stopped the bots
[18421.64s -> 18425.08s]  they must they may have like they may have just incorporated something that like stops the
[18425.08s -> 18434.92s]  software but i don't know i haven't heard anything about it but i have no clue i'll be
[18434.92s -> 18461.79s]  real i don't know you had a trick follow you around last game i got boots one
[18461.79s -> 18462.79s]  1.
[18462.79s -> 18463.79s]  2.
[18463.79s -> 18464.79s]  3.
[18464.79s -> 18469.15s]  4.
[18469.15s -> 18470.15s]  5.
[18470.15s -> 18471.15s]  6.
[18471.15s -> 18472.15s]  7.
[18472.15s -> 18473.15s]  8.
[18473.15s -> 18474.15s]  9.
[18474.15s -> 18475.15s]  10.
[18475.15s -> 18476.15s]  11.
[18476.15s -> 18477.15s]  12.
[18477.15s -> 18478.15s]  13.
[18478.15s -> 18492.68s]  14.
[18492.68s -> 18493.68s]  15.
[18493.68s -> 18494.68s]  16.
[18494.68s -> 18495.68s]  17.
[18495.68s -> 18496.68s]  18.
[18496.68s -> 18497.68s]  19.
[18497.68s -> 18498.68s]  20.
[18498.68s -> 18501.32s]  21.
[18501.32s -> 18502.32s]  22.
[18502.32s -> 18503.32s]  23.
[18503.32s -> 18504.32s]  24.
[18504.32s -> 18519.56s]  25.
[18519.56s -> 18520.56s]  26.
[18520.56s -> 18521.56s]  27.
[18521.56s -> 18522.56s]  28.
[18522.56s -> 18527.60s]  answer to every time I wrote bot.
[18527.60s -> 18539.49s]  That was funny.
[18539.49s -> 18541.53s]  Yeah, I assume that's a good point.
[18541.53s -> 18545.25s]  I guess if you're in iron, you could like play to learn the game a bit better and
[18545.25s -> 18547.45s]  then you could like play a new account and see where you got.
[18547.45s -> 18550.17s]  Yeah, no, that would work.
[18550.17s -> 18556.90s]  That makes sense.
[18556.90s -> 18557.90s]  Sure.
[18557.90s -> 18558.90s]  I'll first pick men.
[18558.90s -> 18563.12s]  I'll first pick Senna.
[18563.12s -> 18568.92s]  I guarantee they walk in fucking these people are gonna walk in fucking Nautilus
[18568.92s -> 18569.92s]  or some shits.
[18569.92s -> 18583.44s]  It'll be like Jarvan, Nautilus, I don't even know.
[18583.44s -> 18585.96s]  Riven's not too bad for Senna, it's okay, it's okay to get flanks.
[18585.96s -> 18588.16s]  I actually don't think Riven's too bad right now.
[18588.16s -> 18591.00s]  Maybe all the Riven players I've played against suck, but I don't think she's actually
[18591.00s -> 18592.20s]  that bad.
[18592.20s -> 18595.02s]  I think Riven's like just you have to position well.
[18595.02s -> 18598.80s]  I think Riven's really broken at abusing positioning.
[18598.80s -> 18601.00s]  That's why she's so good in solo queue.
[18601.00s -> 18606.52s]  good riven players i'll get really gross flanks and the flanks are what's op yeah there's the
[18606.52s -> 18612.62s]  gragas okay i was like they're gonna pick something to fuck me over this guy picked gragas
[18612.62s -> 18617.34s]  but it was gonna be like j4 or gragas or something and then this guy is the support
[18617.34s -> 18623.98s]  he'll probably pick nautilus unless he's a one trick right like unless this guy's straight up
[18623.98s -> 18631.26s]  just like a one trick he'll pick like nautilus or some shits maybe rakan rakan or nautilus
[18631.26s -> 18642.11s]  Because if he picks an enchanter, we just win the game.
[18642.11s -> 18647.88s]  He has to pick engage.
[18647.88s -> 18651.28s]  Melio would be really good here too, actually.
[18651.28s -> 18653.80s]  Because Melio would counter half our team.
[18653.80s -> 18657.52s]  You can Melio Q, Wukong, and Kennen and engage.
[18657.52s -> 18663.62s]  Like if this guy played Melio, this would actually be a hard lane.
[18663.62s -> 18664.62s]  Tom Kinch?
[18664.62s -> 18670.29s]  I mean, I get it.
[18670.29s -> 18672.09s]  But I think it's bad.
[18672.09s -> 18673.09s]  Runes?
[18673.09s -> 18674.81s]  Oh shit.
[18675.13s -> 18679.83s]  Yo, you just saved me looking like an absolute fool. Thank you
[18681.29s -> 18685.79s]  Holy crap if you wanted to see my ruins there here, but thank you. You reminded me. Yeah, I'm gonna be I'm gonna get some water
[18686.01s -> 18687.45s]  I'll be right back
[18687.45s -> 18728.41s]  Get some agua
[18728.41s -> 18731.05s]  By the way, the people who are here to watch me play 80 carry. I
[18732.59s -> 18734.59s]  Sincerely apologize. I
[18734.99s -> 18743.46s]  Know watching me play Senna is probably boring as fuck. Okay, I know
[18743.46s -> 18749.54s]  know and I promise you we will play AD carry at some point I promise you I
[18749.54s -> 18753.14s]  played like the first four hours of the stream was AD carry or the first three
[18753.14s -> 18756.34s]  right I played on my smurf for a few games and played some AD so if you want
[18756.34s -> 18760.74s]  to watch that you can go back in the pod we did some my commentary and shit
[18760.74s -> 18764.88s]  the only reason I'm playing so much Senna and support on this account is
[18764.88s -> 18769.90s]  because like there the elo I'm currently in is like the worst elo to
[18769.90s -> 18775.78s]  climb in solo queue because of a lot of factors and support has some of the
[18775.78s -> 18782.70s]  highest impact on the game whereas like 80k has high impact late but in solo
[18782.70s -> 18787.32s]  queue you want to have high impact early and I wanted to be able to impact the
[18787.32s -> 18813.18s]  game really early on so yeah sorry about being you know boring and shit I
[18813.18s -> 18825.78s]  just really want to like win games at least on this accounts I want to
[18825.78s -> 18829.22s]  get out of the silo because the faster I get out of the silo the the
[18829.22s -> 18849.78s]  The faster I get out of Z-Load, the faster I can have fun playing ADC and trying to climb.
[18849.78s -> 18854.96s]  What a weird play by these guys, what the fuck?
[18854.96s -> 18872.57s]  They half shoved the waves to get early bush control, and then they did shit like that?
[18872.57s -> 18874.61s]  This guy's just dead, I'm gonna give it to Twitch.
[18874.61s -> 18880.52s]  Nice, we got his exhausts.
[18880.52s -> 18881.98s]  So I wasted my exhaust there.
[18881.98s -> 18885.00s]  I did it because I thought the Jinx was gonna insta flash.
[18886.78s -> 18889.64s]  Like I didn't exhaust because I was like scared of her damage.
[18889.64s -> 18891.44s]  I did it because I thought she was gonna like
[18891.44s -> 18893.56s]  try and flash away the second that's.
[18895.28s -> 18896.76s]  But I landed my snare.
[18896.76s -> 18897.70s]  It was kind of bad by me.
[18897.70s -> 18899.78s]  I mean, I landed my snare so I didn't need to exhaust her.
[18899.78s -> 18902.04s]  I just was like, oh, maybe she'll flash.
[18902.04s -> 18903.82s]  She did not, she did not flash.
[18905.56s -> 18906.40s]  What do you know is this?
[18906.40s -> 18908.68s]  This is 500 LP masters, 400 LP.
[18910.14s -> 18911.36s]  It's insane, I know.
[18912.58s -> 18938.01s]  Absolutely crazy put that ward there because gragas is probably bot. Yeah
[18939.77s -> 18948.06s]  So
[18948.06s -> 18955.12s]  Mmm, they're trying to come up from bot to kill me here like their bot lanes rotating up to try and kill me
[18956.42s -> 18961.30s]  So just be careful twitch there they're in here man. I
[18962.54s -> 18976.40s]  Actually have to back and walk look this is hilarious. The enemy bobbing literally is roaming mid. Look at this
[18977.32s -> 18980.56s]  What?
[18980.56s -> 18982.00s]  Why?
[18982.00s -> 18993.13s]  I'm not trying to soak his XP. I just want those souls. I'm scared to walk in here. I don't know where Gragas is
[18993.13s -> 19008.19s]  I gotta come bot to help my twitch so they don't freeze the wave
[19008.71s -> 19013.57s]  Like I don't want them to be able to freeze here
[19015.68s -> 19018.04s]  Even if Gragas ganks we win we win the fight right now
[19020.19s -> 19024.43s]  Like it's an easy fight win as long as you don't get knocked up. We just win the fight automatically
[19032.32s -> 19035.14s]  Actually, we're trying to bait Gragas to come gank this
[19043.48s -> 19044.76s]  easy
[19044.76s -> 19046.76s]  double flashes, baby easy
[19051.68s -> 19064.98s]  You fucking cowards
[19064.98s -> 19066.50s]  We should back up
[19066.50s -> 19068.18s]  Like I can go buy now
[19068.18s -> 19069.94s]  Oh gragas is top
[19069.94s -> 19071.94s]  We could actually maybe do dragon
[19073.54s -> 19078.34s]  Yo, i'm gonna be real ace soul roaming is not a not in like the top list of me being like nervous about it
[19080.84s -> 19082.84s]  Like i'm not nervous about ace soul roaming man
[19086.32s -> 19088.64s]  Push this so we can oh we're diving them
[19089.92s -> 19093.22s]  That's a bit scary. Welcome to the league of draven
[19094.32s -> 19096.40s]  Good to see you're back to enjoying the game
[19096.40s -> 19099.34s]  Oh, we're going still diving that that's not good
[19100.06s -> 19116.32s]  Like we back off here, man. I mean we can maybe go up here if you really want to I kind of want to ward this
[19116.32s -> 19123.28s]  I
[19123.28s -> 19125.40s]  Need to reset though really badly right now
[19126.20s -> 19132.13s]  like really badly
[19133.17s -> 19135.51s]  Not being on the map here is really bad
[19136.93s -> 19138.93s]  Or rather not like having
[19139.29s -> 19142.25s]  Gold spent and being on the map is what I'm gonna say. Like it's really fucking bad
[19143.05s -> 19146.73s]  Yo back up, you know, Greg is that you watched him walk past three wards
[19148.05s -> 19150.57s]  That's why I just warded. No, no, he's still here
[19151.45s -> 19153.45s]  Ragas is right there
[19154.21s -> 19165.03s]  Like we know Greg is is somewhere bot lane right now, I don't know where but we know he's there they're on dragon. Okay
[19165.95s -> 19167.95s]  We can fight this go go go
[19168.31s -> 19186.63s]  W over I'm here. Nice. Yo, come here
[19188.15s -> 19190.85s]  Y'all help you come get this come get this motherfuckers blue
[19192.35s -> 19194.35s]  I got you, baby
[19211.03s -> 19220.30s]  What the fuck made a bitch?
[19221.38s -> 19228.98s]  Well, I guess I'll back
[19230.10s -> 19234.54s]  Yo Spartan, thank you for the six months man. Welcome back appreciate it
[19235.90s -> 19238.66s]  This will back we'll get our fucking umbral
[19240.02s -> 19242.02s]  I'm gonna go top side of the map now
[19242.66s -> 19244.82s]  And I'm gonna help my team get rift heralds
[19245.62s -> 19248.54s]  I'm gonna ping I want to go top side. I want to help my team get rifts
[19249.14s -> 19259.32s]  The wave if we look at bot wave, it's pushing into us. It's totally fine
[19260.16s -> 19262.16s]  Okay, which is level six
[19263.60s -> 19286.59s]  The bot waves pushing in we are totally fine to do what I'm doing right now. He doesn't know I'm here. I'm dead though
[19293.27s -> 19296.77s]  bro
[19296.77s -> 19299.01s]  No joke. I almost juked that
[19300.29s -> 19305.47s]  That's so close. I was hoping like Wukong for some reason didn't walk top side
[19305.47s -> 19308.47s]  But the enemy bot lane did?
[19308.47s -> 19314.83s]  Okay, the enemy bot lane just griefed their entire game.
[19314.83s -> 19316.83s]  The game's over, we win.
[19316.83s -> 19319.83s]  What the fuck are they doing? What is happening?
[19319.83s -> 19324.53s]  Like my Twitch is just getting free plays.
[19324.53s -> 19339.94s]  Wait, you guys are griefing.
[19339.94s -> 19341.94s]  I'm griefing.
[19341.94s -> 19343.94s]  Dude, what the fuck?
[19343.94s -> 19345.94s]  We- Why would you fight them?
[19345.94s -> 19349.94s]  Guys, guys, guys, Wukong.
[19349.94s -> 19350.94s]  Wukong!
[19350.94s -> 19356.98s]  Okay, we see that our twitch is getting free plates bought free first turret. Okay, I'm backed
[19356.98s -> 19363.42s]  I almost soloed their ad carry. Okay, or their jungler. Why would you ever on purpose?
[19364.22s -> 19369.12s]  Take a for a fight like that with no. Oh, I have cancer. I
[19370.26s -> 19371.38s]  also
[19371.38s -> 19377.96s]  The Wukong's an idiot. He doesn't understand macro at all apparently because I literally pinged to come to rift
[19378.10s -> 19380.10s]  My Wukong was like nervous
[19381.06s -> 19389.04s]  Like for some reason Wukong didn't walk top. He sat bot trying to gank, but the objective was Rift not
[19391.30s -> 19394.66s]  God I'm losing my mind in this elo. Masters players are
[19395.58s -> 19398.74s]  Literally just diamond players with slightly better mechanics
[19398.74s -> 19402.96s]  They don't know anything about the game and I'm about to my brains about to explode like a peanut
[19403.30s -> 19408.72s]  It's not about them laning 2v2 you fucking come quad
[19408.72s -> 19416.12s]  Dude, I know they can't lane against us 2v2. It's not about the 2v2 man. We we get a free rift herald because
[19416.52s -> 19420.92s]  We shut down their bot lane and I'm on an item spike. So we just automatically get a free rift
[19421.40s -> 19423.40s]  It has nothing to do with 2v2
[19426.49s -> 19428.49s]  This cumquat motherfucker. I
[19433.57s -> 19437.07s]  Don't know why that's my insult the pedestrian guy got to me
[19439.29s -> 19440.65s]  Somehow
[19440.65s -> 19449.34s]  Where the fuck is this ward? Oh
[19449.34s -> 19460.98s]  Oh, because I'm telling you right now my macro there was a hundred percent correct by the way, like one thousand percents
[19471.35s -> 19475.59s]  Like even though I died, I know it was correct. No. No, just do dragon do not dive
[19476.63s -> 19479.83s]  Guys, we don't have to not everything's about kills. Not everything's about kills. We got this
[19481.27s -> 19485.59s]  Like you don't need to dive. You don't need to dive always you don't need to see a kill be like, oh monkey kill brain
[19485.59s -> 19492.47s]  Go like the game is about like getting objectives on timers and playing off of tempo and things like that
[19492.79s -> 19498.27s]  Like the only reason we even lost rift was because my Wukong went full monkey brain and was like no
[19498.27s -> 19501.99s]  We need to not play for this rift with a giant massive lead
[19522.24s -> 19524.08s]  Wait kill this guy
[19524.08s -> 19530.27s]  What am I watching right now?
[19531.79s -> 19538.79s]  This is outrageous my Wukong just solo ulted there dude, I'm gonna lose it my Wukong just solo ulted their Gragas
[19539.39s -> 19551.40s]  on a good note though
[19551.88s -> 19554.76s]  They don't get any plates off of rifting. So it's not that bad
[19556.50s -> 19562.43s]  Okay, man, just push like dude hit the minions like stop my bad
[19563.75s -> 19567.51s]  Sorry, I'm wound up right now. Canon. Okay, I'm a little wound
[19568.55s -> 19570.55s]  Apologies if I if I grieved you man
[19572.23s -> 19574.23s]  It's fine
[19574.39s -> 19576.39s]  So to wound up it's fine. I
[19576.95s -> 19582.71s]  Just don't like when like stuff like that happens. I'm a perfectionist and it's my base. I talked about this earlier
[19582.75s -> 19586.03s]  I'm a perfectionist. My biggest flaw is that like I will
[19587.35s -> 19591.59s]  Play the game 100% correctly on like tempo and timers, but you can't do that
[19592.15s -> 19594.87s]  Because you got to remember to like your teammates or teammates
[19598.62s -> 19601.90s]  Like like they're not just gonna instantly know exactly what you're what what to do
[19613.29s -> 19616.89s]  We win the guy don't just stand here and watch me die, man
[19618.17s -> 19620.17s]  Holy shit
[19623.75s -> 19628.15s]  That is oh my god if he if he had let me die there I might have screamed
[19629.27s -> 19631.67s]  Actually screamed out loud in anger
[19632.55s -> 19640.43s]  Like dude is watching me kite these people within one inch of my life and instead of
[19640.43s -> 19645.55s]  like helping or walking up and doing anything, you know what he does?
[19645.55s -> 19647.19s]  He pulls a fucking growth score.
[19647.19s -> 19652.21s]  My man just likes to watch.
[19652.21s -> 19672.10s]  Something wrong with it, but you know, there's a time and a place.
[19672.10s -> 19674.42s]  I don't actually want to buy pinks because I don't think we're strong enough that
[19674.42s -> 19678.02s]  uh, I don't think that we're strong enough that I can actually even defend the pinks
[19678.02s -> 19679.02s]  right now if I'm being honest.
[19679.02s -> 19683.26s]  Like we should be strong enough, but we kind of threw our lead when I over forced
[19683.26s -> 19684.98s]  the rift.
[19684.98s -> 19700.08s]  So I think, I think we need to push this wave so that we can get tempo and move around
[19700.08s -> 19701.08s]  the map.
[19701.08s -> 19702.08s]  Pryo.
[19702.08s -> 19709.38s]  Sorry, I keep saying the wrong thing.
[19709.38s -> 19710.38s]  Uh oh.
[19710.38s -> 19711.38s]  That guy's dead.
[19711.38s -> 19713.74s]  I have to ditch that guy.
[19713.74s -> 19714.74s]  He's dead as fuck.
[19714.74s -> 19715.74s]  Oh, I'm dead too, maybe?
[19715.74s -> 19717.74s]  Oh, I am so dead.
[19717.74s -> 19720.70s]  Yeah, that was my bad.
[19720.70s -> 19721.70s]  That was my bad.
[19721.70s -> 19722.70s]  My bad, my bad.
[19722.70s -> 19724.30s]  Like, we just got ran down.
[19724.30s -> 19728.18s]  That was on me.
[19728.18s -> 19736.86s]  Like we had good positioning, but the jungler wasn't close enough, so this is my bad.
[19736.86s -> 19743.37s]  I also didn't expect to get fucking 4-mans, but I should have, right?
[19743.37s -> 19745.23s]  We should play for this though.
[19745.23s -> 19748.81s]  I wish I could type, I wish I wasn't chat restricted for a year.
[19748.81s -> 19753.09s]  Dude, I swear to God, I'm not even being mean.
[19753.09s -> 19757.49s]  Like Riot was like, they chat restricted me because I type so much macro that it
[19757.49s -> 19765.33s]  gets on people's nerves and they don't want me spam typing.
[19765.33s -> 19780.67s]  Lowkey don't play rift. Don't play for rifts. I need help guys if you guys can help
[19781.87s -> 19795.23s]  We need to clear vision on dragon a year
[19795.23s -> 19800.55s]  Yeah, I get uncharted starts at April 15th or April 11th or some shit
[19801.99s -> 19803.99s]  2024
[19804.11s -> 19808.35s]  I've never seen it. It must have been like an actual writer or something
[19808.59s -> 19812.03s]  Like I've never seen an automated system give you a year chat restricts, right?
[19812.03s -> 19815.03s]  So in my mind, it's got to be like an actual like
[19817.58s -> 19819.58s]  Like a rioter was like Geronimo
[19820.60s -> 19823.14s]  We know you're good enough to climb but stop typing
[19824.70s -> 19834.35s]  You know, I mean that's like what must have been going on and I'm like, okay well
[19835.45s -> 19851.88s]  sure, I
[19851.88s -> 19853.88s]  Mean, I didn't know you could get chat banned a year
[19854.52s -> 19857.36s]  What's weird is like I said, I don't like say trigger words
[19857.36s -> 19859.56s]  It's not like I tell people to like end themselves and stuff
[19859.56s -> 19865.04s]  It's mainly just me typing like go here do that do this like I type a lot, right?
[19865.28s -> 19869.08s]  Which is obviously like if you type a lot it can be toxic as well. So
[19872.82s -> 19874.82s]  Like typing a lot annoying so I get it
[19886.23s -> 19889.39s]  We should be playing for Baron side vision right now not
[19890.57s -> 19893.43s]  The vision we're playing with right now is bad. We should be playing over here
[19895.13s -> 19899.09s]  Like I want to play for Baron vision, but it's a little hard to do that right now
[19899.09s -> 19907.88s]  Because you see how Tom Kenshin and me are like transferring vision control around the map right now
[19908.40s -> 19912.02s]  We're playing this little support game of like hide the vision
[19913.48s -> 19915.48s]  Look at this fuck
[19931.10s -> 19952.71s]  Oh, he's so dumb. I still think he's dumb. How did I just take
[19958.61s -> 19960.61s]  tonight I
[19960.61s -> 19962.61s]  Took my entire HP bar on a global
[19963.01s -> 19965.92s]  my bad
[19965.92s -> 19968.68s]  Dude, I really wish the mouthlight would group though. I
[19969.80s -> 19973.28s]  Get that he's like doing the thing where he's like, oh, let's you know split
[19973.28s -> 19975.96s]  I like his play was actually really smart there
[19976.56s -> 19980.60s]  The mouth lights play I mean like that wasn't his fault that we got shit on at all
[19980.60s -> 19985.44s]  I just wish they would group because if he groups up and hits are we win every team fight
[19986.28s -> 19991.28s]  Because right now our only frontliner is the Wukong right and the fact that Wukong's our frontliner
[19991.28s -> 19993.28s]  We don't have the ability to play the game
[19994.74s -> 19996.74s]  When I get stuck on that what the fuck was that
[19998.00s -> 20004.84s]  Like that Tom kinch getting to eat forward like that blindly into our entire team and then not getting punished for it
[20004.84s -> 20007.24s]  Might be the most like solo queue thing I've ever seen
[20007.84s -> 20009.84s]  Nobody wanted to hit him because he was the tank
[20010.24s -> 20012.24s]  but uh
[20012.44s -> 20015.00s]  Yeah, that's we should still kill him, you know
[20020.81s -> 20024.37s]  We can fight this guy. Oh my god jungler just come. Oh
[20024.37s -> 20028.11s]  Oh, we're forfeiting. Oh, okay. Now that makes perfect sense, right?
[20030.31s -> 20031.91s]  Just come group
[20031.91s -> 20034.51s]  Bro, Kennen come group, please guys
[20035.19s -> 20038.85s]  Like I don't know why everybody's frustrated. We're literally still up in gold
[20039.75s -> 20041.91s]  Please come group up. We just took an inhibitor
[20042.83s -> 20044.83s]  Just just come group
[20045.79s -> 20048.81s]  Help me get vision on this dragon so that I don't so we don't die
[20049.55s -> 20052.81s]  Like I need my team to actually walk over here to help me get vision
[20053.49s -> 20059.80s]  It's really frustrating because I need the frontliners the wukong in the mouth fight to walk in with me
[20060.44s -> 20064.40s]  Because I'm a little fucking well, I have a big gun, but I'm a big gun girl, right?
[20064.60s -> 20068.88s]  So I need I need these two guys to walk in with me these two big burly mountain men
[20069.88s -> 20079.68s]  So that I can play the game, you know, no, we don't push bot. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[20080.20s -> 20082.64s]  Mid no bot is worthless come in
[20083.32s -> 20085.72s]  My mouth fights pushing the wave that we already have down. I
[20086.40s -> 20088.40s]  wish I could macro I
[20088.40s -> 20092.06s]  Wish I could type some macro right now. They're they're like, well, my team is so lost
[20092.68s -> 20096.90s]  They're so beyond lost right now. It's crazy
[20098.89s -> 20108.68s]  They're lost this shit
[20108.68s -> 20112.24s]  Just do do dragon. Yes, just do this. Just do it. I'll start it for you. Here you go. I
[20113.00s -> 20116.80s]  Don't know why we're standing in a bush waiting for them to face check your dragon guess
[20117.40s -> 20126.20s]  I'm sorry. I swear to God you have to do everything in the zero where you have to start every fight
[20126.20s -> 20128.68s]  I have to basically I have to start every fight
[20129.20s -> 20131.72s]  Right. I have to not only start every fight
[20131.72s -> 20136.76s]  But I have to like ping my team what to do exactly because everybody plays so safe in this elo
[20137.40s -> 20139.64s]  Why did my mouth fight just stop his back?
[20141.52s -> 20153.73s]  Why are you all fighting oh my god, please guys, it's fine. It's not fun
[20155.13s -> 20162.63s]  No mouth fight you can't 1v9 that just back off. They didn't get anything. They didn't get anything. We got dragon. We're on dragon soul points
[20162.63s -> 20170.39s]  I'm losing hairs. I'm losing fucking hairs, man. I ain't got many hairs to spare anymore.
[20170.39s -> 20179.22s]  We're out here losing hair. It's like I'm babysitting. Like this has got to be what
[20179.22s -> 20184.10s]  a preschool teacher feels like, you know, like low key, like preschool teacher just
[20184.10s -> 20193.22s]  feels feels like this. This has to be it. Like watch it. It's like watching a toddler.
[20193.22s -> 20196.82s]  Like you watch them from the corner, right? And they're like eating glue. And you're
[20196.82s -> 20200.70s]  like, I mean, that's bad. And then you tell them like, don't eat glue. Don't eat
[20200.70s -> 20204.08s]  glue timmy and he's like okay and then like you leave him there for five
[20204.08s -> 20207.06s]  minutes to go like do something to watch somebody else then all of a sudden
[20207.06s -> 20212.70s]  timmy's eating glue again and you're like bro bro we just had this
[20212.70s -> 20224.91s]  discussion and it's like not timmy's fault right because he's a toddler so
[20224.91s -> 20228.47s]  you can't be mad at timmy because he's a toddler you can't but it's
[20228.47s -> 20242.96s]  like it's frustrating it's like god damn it man like what is what is
[20242.96s -> 20246.64s]  happening like mouth fight just group my mouth fight has a fetish with just
[20246.64s -> 20260.94s]  pushing bot bro just group and hit r bro i know you have bork wait you have bork wait i bro we
[20260.94s -> 20265.90s]  need we need to be able to engage we don't win through split just group up and hit r and we win
[20267.58s -> 20270.62s]  like i've been controlling the ever-living fuck out of all the vision this game
[20271.34s -> 20275.26s]  i feel like i'm doing all of this to control vision and shit and it still feels like it's
[20275.26s -> 20276.90s]  It's not enough.
[20276.90s -> 20281.29s]  It's kind of nuts.
[20281.29s -> 20290.03s]  Loki, it still feels not enough.
[20290.03s -> 20291.71s]  No, don't go bot, don't go bot, don't go bot,
[20291.71s -> 20293.35s]  don't go bot, please don't go bot.
[20294.99s -> 20304.59s]  Hit me!
[20304.59s -> 20315.10s]  They don't have a ward, they don't know I'm there.
[20315.10s -> 20322.26s]  What, we're just not gonna ult that guy or what?
[20322.26s -> 20325.06s]  This is why we listen.
[20326.18s -> 20329.50s]  Oh my God, I have, I actually just, I'm so,
[20329.50s -> 20331.08s]  I don't know what to say.
[20331.08s -> 20332.94s]  Like I literally pinged to come.
[20332.94s -> 20334.84s]  Wukong didn't use ulti.
[20334.84s -> 20337.44s]  Twitch just died in, and now he's AFK.
[20337.44s -> 20338.28s]  Oh my God.
[20338.28s -> 20339.90s]  Oh my God, kill me in game.
[20339.90s -> 20341.86s]  Kennen and Malphite, can you guys do anything?
[20341.86s -> 20352.87s]  Like, bro, can we, can we like,
[20352.87s -> 20377.77s]  just go in Kennen, just ulti.
[20377.77s -> 20380.43s]  Okay guys, we get, we get Baron here.
[20380.43s -> 20383.47s]  Look, the enemy team threw, go to Baron.
[20383.47s -> 20384.31s]  Please.
[20385.19s -> 20386.99s]  Please go Baron.
[20386.99s -> 20392.50s]  Please.
[20392.50s -> 20400.25s]  We get Sol and Baron here.
[20400.25s -> 20407.28s]  Dude, I swear to God, these people are not real.
[20407.28s -> 20408.94s]  Bro, we do not need the Malphite.
[20410.46s -> 20416.80s]  I am a higher level than my jungler.
[20416.80s -> 20417.62s]  Push mid.
[20417.62s -> 20419.84s]  Guys, you gotta push mid first.
[20419.84s -> 20425.99s]  Listen, homies, you gotta push mid first.
[20425.99s -> 20426.83s]  You know what?
[20426.83s -> 20427.65s]  Fuck it.
[20427.65s -> 20428.49s]  Don't even go in.
[20428.49s -> 20429.63s]  Yeah, fuck it, push mid.
[20429.63s -> 20431.07s]  We're just gonna end the game.
[20431.07s -> 20433.87s]  If they go for dragon here, we just push, fuck it.
[20438.95s -> 20454.34s]  That's actually such a good macro call, not even joking.
[20454.34s -> 20456.04s]  Such a good macro call, actually.
[20456.46s -> 20463.16s]  Everybody just run though. Just run
[20463.92s -> 20466.88s]  No, don't don't ulti in. No guys. We don't fight this
[20467.60s -> 20469.60s]  Whole I have cancer
[20469.88s -> 20471.88s]  We're getting flanked boys
[20472.32s -> 20475.64s]  Dude, I have such high levels of cancer right now. You have no idea
[20476.72s -> 20479.34s]  Like I high fucking functioning cancer
[20480.28s -> 20520.03s]  You guys just kill the fucking gragas. Oh my god. Thank God. Thank God. Just end the game
[20520.91s -> 20523.51s]  Please end the game. Please hit the fucking dick. Oh
[20525.47s -> 20529.91s]  Oh my god, Walter White is like my hero right now
[20529.91s -> 20536.61s]  I don't even understand like I feel like every like I feel like what Walter White felt like dealing with Skyler
[20536.91s -> 20539.27s]  For literally three years like this is outrageous
[20540.27s -> 20547.84s]  This is what this feels like like I do I can relate to the show so much more. Oh my god
[20548.32s -> 20552.21s]  like dude, I
[20576.16s -> 20578.16s]  crap
[20578.16s -> 20582.64s]  3rd look at like just look at the like look at like what's going on in the game
[20583.16s -> 20593.42s]  Like I I don't even mean to be mean about this. It's just this is this is crazy
[20596.97s -> 20598.97s]  Malfight though popping off
[20599.57s -> 20620.70s]  Malfight popping off like what do you know is this guy? Oh, he's literally diamond. Why is this guy in this game?
[20620.70s -> 20622.70s]  I mean, I feel I feel like
[20623.14s -> 20627.02s]  Confused now. I'm not even blaming the Wukong anymore. I don't know why this guy is in the game. Oh
[20627.02s -> 20638.51s]  Oh, he has inflated as MMR. Oh, he just has previous season inflated MMR. That's what
[20638.51s -> 20644.87s]  this is because he was GM for three years. So the his MMR says that he like belongs here,
[20644.87s -> 20650.72s]  even though he doesn't play like I bet you last season he only played like 50 games.
[20650.72s -> 20654.60s]  I can look right? We just see like how many games he played. Yeah, he played he played
[20654.60s -> 20658.52s]  like 50 games last season. So like his MMR didn't really change. He just got
[20658.52s -> 20662.20s]  masters and then stopped which is fine there's nothing wrong with
[20662.20s -> 20673.94s]  that's i just wish he would chill you know
[20673.94s -> 20679.49s]  like like uh not rage quit halfway through the game
[20679.49s -> 20682.85s]  because like i said people's elo and shit used to bother me a lot i don't i
[20682.85s -> 20685.41s]  don't get bothered by anymore because i realized it was cringe
[20685.41s -> 20688.21s]  i don't care about their elo and shit what i care about is like i just want
[20688.21s -> 20689.89s]  them to play the game you know what i mean
[20689.89s -> 20693.49s]  like i just want them to not rage not not like be absolute apes in the
[20693.49s -> 20695.73s]  game and just play that's all i ask for
[20695.73s -> 20698.93s]  I don't care if you're a diamond player or a plot player in the game and you're just like accidentally in the game
[20698.93s -> 20701.17s]  It's not your fault. I just want you to push buttons
[20705.51s -> 20707.51s]  What i'm doing wrong to have a 36 win, right?
[20711.20s -> 20714.56s]  Uh, I can't see the link because just you'd have to give me your name and your server
[20718.05s -> 20721.89s]  How are you guys doing by the way? Everybody having a good day. You guys enjoying the stream having a good time?
[20722.85s -> 20728.77s]  Watching me go bald in live like live time. You guys are like, oh look Geronimo's going bald live on stream
[20728.77s -> 20730.77s]  And i'm like, yeah
[20731.17s -> 20732.53s]  It's rough
[20732.53s -> 20769.70s]  Hold on i'm gonna take my pants off
[20770.34s -> 20776.29s]  Dude, what? I I fuck you guys
[20777.45s -> 20783.25s]  They fucking like I get double-swapped. Did you guys see that shit? Oh, yeah, the support could do it and then he banned Senna
[20783.25s -> 20784.57s]  I
[20784.57s -> 20786.57s]  Mean, I didn't hover it. That's my bad
[20787.37s -> 20795.46s]  God damn it. I should have hovered. I was just like taking my pants off and now he wants first pick
[20797.72s -> 20803.97s]  Dude, what? Oh my god. I hate I don't I don't know. I don't know what to say. This is crazy
[20808.91s -> 20810.91s]  Today's Thursday, right?
[20811.83s -> 20824.30s]  My losing days today's Thursday, right guys it is okay cool. Oh
[20826.06s -> 20828.62s]  What do I play they have Zareth and Zinn
[20830.02s -> 20842.09s]  If Zaya, I mean I guess I could just play Rakan. It's not a big deal. Let's see what their bot lane is though
[20842.09s -> 20844.81s]  I actually have to see what their bot lane is to choose my runes
[20845.77s -> 20850.56s]  So no, no
[20851.08s -> 20853.08s]  Oh they have an Ezreal
[20853.24s -> 20855.24s]  The fuck is their team comp?
[20855.24s -> 20879.89s]  Um, okay.
[20879.89s -> 20880.89s]  When you do this build,
[20880.89s -> 20882.43s]  what's the secondary supposed to be?
[20882.43s -> 20887.95s]  I think it's supposed to be this.
[20887.95s -> 20889.45s]  Or maybe like revitalize?
[20890.47s -> 20894.86s]  I just feel like unflinching's so good.
[20894.86s -> 20897.82s]  Oh, they have a support Zareth.
[20897.82s -> 20899.06s]  So support Zareth, yeah, yeah, okay.
[20899.06s -> 20902.80s]  So I want, I definitely want glacial here.
[20902.80s -> 20904.14s]  And I want,
[20905.60s -> 20908.38s]  maybe I take MR actually instead of armor
[20908.38s -> 20911.08s]  because they have two poke champs.
[20911.08s -> 20912.54s]  And I take this.
[20912.54s -> 20917.06s]  Yeah, yeah, this is good, okay.
[20917.06s -> 20918.68s]  That's not bad, okay.
[20918.68s -> 20919.66s]  One sec, I'll be right back.
[20919.66s -> 20967.79s]  I need to get some more water.
[20967.79s -> 20976.08s]  There's Rift.
[20976.08s -> 20978.10s]  30 seconds until minions spawn.
[20978.10s -> 20989.39s]  Oh shit, no, don't flag me.
[20989.39s -> 20994.19s]  Fuck man, I had to pee.
[20994.19s -> 20996.27s]  Fucking flag me for AFK because I didn't take a week.
[20996.27s -> 21000.16s]  Can you not start with AD carry then move over to support?
[21000.16s -> 21002.64s]  I always fall asleep before the AD carry gameplay.
[21002.64s -> 21003.64s]  Wait, what?
[21003.64s -> 21006.04s]  I always fall asleep before AD carry?
[21006.04s -> 21009.12s]  What do you mean?
[21009.12s -> 21011.28s]  Oh, you mean like start with my main and then play
[21014.16s -> 21027.89s]  Yeah, I played 80 carry at the start, uh, I should probably
[21029.71s -> 21032.43s]  Play 80 carry more over support, uh
[21034.03s -> 21035.63s]  Later in the stream
[21035.63s -> 21037.63s]  Here i'll play an 80 carry game after this
[21038.11s -> 21056.96s]  I feel bad
[21056.96s -> 21059.76s]  Oh, it's gragas. I thought it was gonna be zareth, but it's gragas
[21059.76s -> 21068.41s]  I don't want to fight too hard level one, even though that guy I should have gone in there. That's my bad
[21068.41s -> 21072.93s]  I want to I want to try and get level two here, even though I think we actually win level one. Oh
[21075.78s -> 21079.48s]  I got his bone plating. Yeah, I should have fought level one. That was my bad
[21080.50s -> 21083.06s]  Because we went very hard level one. I just griefed it
[21084.26s -> 21088.66s]  Like all I have to do there is go in on the Ezreal or the gragas level one and they can't play the game
[21090.18s -> 21108.54s]  Right, it's not worth it's not worth
[21108.54s -> 21115.89s]  There's no way that I can not get E'd by Gragas there by the way.
[21115.89s -> 21129.60s]  I don't know if I can flash W there.
[21129.60s -> 21131.40s]  Maybe we shouldn't be egoing, buddy.
[21131.40s -> 21139.96s]  This guy just fucking ego's in front of me, like what?
[21139.96s -> 21159.13s]  Okay, I might have missed everything there, but like, you know, it's okay.
[21159.43s -> 21173.62s]  It's a little counterproductive
[21175.26s -> 21177.98s]  When I take a tower shot to land a Q
[21179.50s -> 21181.50s]  Feels a little counterproductive
[21188.81s -> 21190.47s]  But hey
[21190.47s -> 21195.96s]  I'm gonna back here just in case
[21196.78s -> 21199.16s]  The enemy Xin tries to gank mid
[21201.77s -> 21203.85s]  Dude, I'm so sad. I can't get boots
[21204.69s -> 21212.43s]  I'm gonna wait. Yeah, I'm gonna be cringe. I'm gonna wait. I
[21213.19s -> 21217.23s]  Would never wait here normally, but you know what? It's just it's so like it's such a big buy
[21218.09s -> 21220.09s]  I don't want to I'm
[21221.49s -> 21227.49s]  Now that now that I've waited and beat cringe now I have to sit here and wait, oh it's so painful. Okay, I'm on my way
[21228.45s -> 21247.41s]  I'm sorry guys
[21247.41s -> 21254.10s]  Worth the wait. Nah, not at all. I got lucky but
[21254.94s -> 21269.71s]  You know, what's interesting. I never use the stupid dematerializer
[21269.71s -> 21274.59s]  I think I should have like I should use it on every cannon or some shit, but I just don't do it
[21275.19s -> 21278.13s]  Because I know the reason you're supposed to use it is because it helps you push
[21278.77s -> 21281.61s]  Because you can dematerialize the cannon right and just insta. Yeah
[21282.37s -> 21285.73s]  so you're supposed to use it because it's like a really fast way to push but it's also a I
[21302.92s -> 21306.92s]  Should not have w'd fuck. I well not the gragas anyway. I
[21307.48s -> 21310.04s]  Fucked up. I shouldn't have w'd the gragas. I should have played it slower
[21312.69s -> 21314.69s]  This guy's gonna die. Oh
[21317.29s -> 21319.37s]  He's gonna die he put himself against the wall GG
[21321.61s -> 21323.49s]  That was my fault though
[21323.49s -> 21327.92s]  100%
[21327.92s -> 21333.02s]  Cuz if I didn't W in they can't kill us right and gragas probably dies to the auto attack anyway
[21333.28s -> 21335.52s]  My thought process was gragas is snared
[21335.52s -> 21340.92s]  So if I W here, but even after like even if I don't get E'd I'm pretty confident I die
[21377.51s -> 21387.98s]  Damnit, I tried I was out of everything. I wonder if I could have played that better
[21388.62s -> 21391.66s]  Maybe like if I could have weaved an extra auto in or something. I
[21392.58s -> 21394.58s]  Don't know
[21394.66s -> 21396.10s]  It's hard to know
[21396.10s -> 21414.28s]  All right. I'm gonna go mid here. I
[21414.28s -> 21422.36s]  I can't okay, well I could go mid, but I think I I think I want to say bot for a bit and get some XP
[21422.36s -> 21450.16s]  I think it's smarter to do that at this point. I think we should push this. I don't want to W in because I know Zin's hair. Yeah
[21451.68s -> 21471.19s]  That's why I didn't want to W because I know Zin's hair. They were just making it so obvious right like that it was like
[21472.79s -> 21476.99s]  Sometimes when people make shit too good to be true it is too good to be true
[21476.99s -> 21481.71s]  Like oh shit, we're just gonna they're just gonna fight us here. Cool. Oh
[21483.39s -> 21489.70s]  Yeah, I gotta help him push my bad I'm playing sloppy
[21490.94s -> 21523.63s]  You just wanna see a cool trick. Watch this. She could push the wave and then just min max the back
[21525.31s -> 21527.31s]  How cool was that
[21527.31s -> 21534.04s]  She just pushes the wave and I just back next to the bush and she's just like, oh, I guess I'll take the free
[21534.04s -> 21548.31s]  ride I
[21548.31s -> 21550.61s]  Really need level six badly
[21562.32s -> 21565.92s]  Like bro, I really cannot get level six right now. This is
[21567.36s -> 21573.25s]  Painful
[21573.25s -> 21576.23s]  Hey kill these maybe I'm six off this. No, guess not. I
[21577.25s -> 21580.53s]  Was gonna stay mid there by the way and help the homie. I
[21581.69s -> 21583.53s]  Need to go mid
[21583.53s -> 21614.43s]  This is so awkward
[21627.83s -> 21635.68s]  Bro, help me
[21635.68s -> 21643.12s]  Bro, like you got to walk to me. Like I can't like my Eve is like here. I'm way over here
[21644.64s -> 21652.93s]  Right? And my Eve's like, yo, homie, like, dude, I'm, like, we're trying to push the wave in for her.
[21652.93s -> 21662.77s]  And she's just not accepting to wait. And I can't W the wall. I mean, I guess I could W the wall
[21662.77s -> 21665.89s]  because I was trying to walk around, right? Like I saw her in trouble when I was here.
[21665.89s -> 21668.69s]  So I wanted her to walk towards here so I could E over the wall.
[21669.65s -> 21672.85s]  That was my thought process. E over the wall helped the guy.
[21672.85s -> 21676.85s]  But he, like, didn't understand that. And I just got shit on and it felt really bad.
[21681.75s -> 21684.11s]  Both our solos are getting absolutely shit on
[21684.71s -> 21688.21s]  This is very bad
[21688.29s -> 21691.67s]  Cuz I don't know how to help our team at this stage
[21692.45s -> 21699.28s]  Like I'm just always behind on tempo now around the map in the wrong spot at the wrong time
[21700.00s -> 21723.66s]  This is so awkward. I
[21725.92s -> 21727.92s]  Have old we could kill this guy
[21735.88s -> 21756.85s]  We could maybe kill the Zen if I sneak in here push the wave push the wave hurry
[21756.85s -> 21781.18s]  He's gotta crash it. I mean, this guy's just dead.
[21781.18s -> 21784.42s]  My AD carry is gonna get fucked for it though, so I hope it was worth.
[21784.42s -> 21795.48s]  Like my AD carry is gonna get zoned. It's really hard to tell if anything like
[21795.48s -> 21800.52s]  that's worth sometimes because I used my ult before a dragon fight. We're
[21800.52s -> 21804.52s]  gonna lose bot tower. There's just so many factors, right? It's so hard.
[21804.52s -> 21807.04s]  And now I don't have wards. Oh, it's so rough.
[21807.04s -> 21828.38s]  I got the ignite off, but dude, I can't believe that Gragas lived
[21829.04s -> 21835.76s]  No, oh I had stopwatch. I have stopwatch. Oh my god. I'm the worst player in existence
[21836.16s -> 21839.82s]  I actually have the ability to live there. Oh
[21840.80s -> 21845.07s]  No, I should sell
[21846.23s -> 21848.23s]  my magi is in shame. I
[21849.07s -> 21851.07s]  Actually just want the item. So
[21852.69s -> 21854.69s]  Dude I'm so bad
[21855.41s -> 21859.75s]  Dude Gragas is low-key a good pick versus Rakan though. You can stop his engage so easily
[21868.64s -> 21870.64s]  It's actually low-key a good pick
[21896.45s -> 21921.87s]  bro
[21921.87s -> 21939.30s]  Nice, not bad. I kind of want to back off here. You know, what feels kind of bad
[21939.74s -> 21941.74s]  he has noticed that I just I got my
[21943.30s -> 21952.43s]  I don't if you guys notice this but I got my fucking I got like four assists just now, but it was after I
[21952.43s -> 21956.83s]  I sold my mages. How fucking bad does that feel?
[21957.99s -> 21959.23s]  like
[21959.23s -> 21966.46s]  Actually, oh by the way, uh, I wanted to ask you guys
[21968.46s -> 21970.98s]  What ad carry do you guys think is the most
[21971.78s -> 21973.82s]  Sought out for people to learn right now
[21976.51s -> 21981.55s]  Like what would you say is like people want to learn this ad carry over other ad carries?
[21982.15s -> 21984.15s]  What are you guys thinking?
[21984.35s -> 21986.35s]  My man says Teemo. Okay
[21986.51s -> 22000.38s]  Makes sense got it depends. Yeah, I'm just trying to wonder like what um
[22002.10s -> 22005.74s]  People would want to watch or what people would want to learn specifically
[22006.38s -> 22009.82s]  So I know everybody plays different shit, but I know there's also like popular shit, you know
[22015.14s -> 22017.14s]  Okay, I'm just bad
[22017.50s -> 22020.22s]  He's bad too. We listen we're we're bad
[22023.48s -> 22068.97s]  We're bad guys
[22068.99s -> 22072.45s]  Not bad
[22072.45s -> 22074.69s]  Jin, Lucian, Xayah, Felios.
[22074.69s -> 22076.29s]  Damn, is it like just that different?
[22076.29s -> 22080.28s]  Like a lot of people like different stuff?
[22080.28s -> 22082.84s]  Cause I've always just thought like, oh no.
[22090.70s -> 22093.26s]  I guess I've always just thought that people like,
[22096.17s -> 22098.01s]  a lot of people really like like meta AD carries
[22098.01s -> 22100.27s]  or like really play-making AD carries, right?
[22100.27s -> 22103.15s]  Like Jinx is probably the best AD carry in the meta,
[22103.15s -> 22104.91s]  but I don't see a lot of people ever ask
[22104.91s -> 22107.69s]  or like request to watch Jinx.
[22107.69s -> 22108.53s]  You know what I mean?
[22108.53s -> 22110.65s]  Like Jinx is not like, she's not like a fun AD carry
[22110.65s -> 22112.15s]  that people want to learn how to play.
[22112.15s -> 22116.63s]  Even though she is like the best AD, there's like the people who are like, oh, yeah, no, Jinx is boring.
[22116.63s -> 22120.39s]  Like I want to play Jin and like shoot people or I want to play like Lucian and dash around like it's like,
[22120.39s -> 22124.71s]  so that's what I'm wondering is like what the number one AD carry is for like people to just like enjoy watching.
[22140.28s -> 22140.88s]  Not bad though.
[22141.72s -> 22141.96s]  Okay.
[22141.96s -> 22143.28s]  I think we could play an AD carry game.
[22143.80s -> 22144.12s]  I'm done.
[22147.20s -> 22148.88s]  I owe you guys an AD carry game.
[22149.80s -> 22152.44s]  I owe you that much for watching me play support for two hours.
[22153.04s -> 22154.48s]  Actually, I think it was like two and a half hours.
[22157.13s -> 22158.73s]  Uh, yeah, we played four games of support.
[22158.73s -> 22159.57s]  So it's like two hours.
[22159.57s -> 22170.04s]  Yeah, I owe you guys for for that Zaya or Vayne.
[22170.04s -> 22173.04s]  Zaya is fun to watch. I do like Zaya.
[22173.04s -> 22181.77s]  You love Jinx and Cait. Oh, there you go.
[22181.77s -> 22182.77s]  You're playing support top.
[22182.77s -> 22186.77s]  So you like to watch how AD carries play it.
[22186.77s -> 22189.77s]  So that you can like better help the homies. Got it. Got it.
[22189.77s -> 22204.96s]  We need eight wins. I think from this point we are right now.
[22204.96s -> 22207.96s]  I think it's eight wins to get to Grandmaster.
[22207.96s -> 22209.96s]  I think. Oops.
[22209.96s -> 22222.40s]  Because we're what 370 something right like three set 360. No, we just won. We're not 360. We're like 370
[22223.90s -> 22228.80s]  For 387. Okay, so it's not updated. But what is this stop?
[22229.24s -> 22236.69s]  So we need what seven wins net wins to get to GM. I
[22237.57s -> 22245.01s]  Think we can hit GM. I'm a little less confident right now about master or about challenger, but I think we can definitely hit GM
[22245.01s -> 22258.58s]  I think I'll get stuck in GM for a bit unless the games get higher quality I'll be stuck
[22258.58s -> 22267.84s]  in GM for a little bit because the thing about the thing about the games so far is
[22267.84s -> 22273.24s]  like the higher quality the games get the easier it actually is to carry if like if
[22273.24s -> 22277.44s]  you're a decent player because the better your teammates get which means that like
[22277.44s -> 22281.20s]  if you're at that like say like a challenger player will have a better time a challenger
[22281.20s -> 22285.68s]  AD Carry player carrying in Challenger if they get a lead, then in Diamond if they get
[22285.68s -> 22286.68s]  a lead.
[22286.68s -> 22292.96s]  I know that sounds weird to say, but it's basically just because when your teammates
[22292.96s -> 22297.08s]  are better, they enable you better, and AD Carry and all those other roles, when they're
[22297.08s -> 22305.66s]  being enabled, it's a lot easier to play the game.
[22305.66s -> 22310.62s]  If I were to first pick Jinx in Challenger MMR, there's a good chance my teammates
[22310.62s -> 22314.06s]  would pick stuff that lets me play Jinx.
[22314.06s -> 22316.42s]  Not saying it would happen, but there's a chance that my teammates would pick
[22316.42s -> 22321.94s]  something that like they would pick like tanks or frontliners or some shit right or like lulu
[22321.94s -> 22325.62s]  whereas like if you're picking if you're picking jinx first pick and like let's say you guys are
[22325.62s -> 22330.18s]  gold average like your support might just literally pick like first time velkans or some shit and
[22330.18s -> 22345.99s]  you're like well this sucks dude i swear every time i hear the end of this song
[22346.79s -> 22353.51s]  does anybody know who forest within is i swear the guy talking at the end of this
[22353.51s -> 22368.29s]  song sounds exactly like Forrest Within. No joke. Listen to this. Listen to this. That guy who was
[22368.29s -> 22372.61s]  like saying it was DJ, like that guy sounded exactly like, I don't know why my brain does that.
[22372.61s -> 22378.85s]  Homie sounded exactly like Forrest Within. I swear to God. It's actually like perfectly.
[22378.85s -> 22387.33s]  Like if you told me that was him, I would immediately believe you. This guy wants to
[22387.33s -> 22397.33s]  join the discord. Oh, I'm nervous about this shit. It is my support though. So like maybe
[22397.33s -> 22412.15s]  we could join the discord and like work together a bit but i'm also nervous about joining discord
[22412.15s -> 22425.14s]  calls with people on stream oh i don't know i don't know if it's worth where would you put
[22425.14s -> 22430.74s]  ezreal on the tier list i think ezreal's a tier i think he he could be s tier for solo queue
[22430.74s -> 22435.86s]  but he's hard he's really hard ezreal is one of the hardest ad's so i would say he's like a
[22435.86s -> 22442.62s]  A tier right now. If you're really good at is he is very, very, very strong. But he's
[22442.62s -> 22449.70s]  also incredibly hard to play. But he also is not weak in the meta. So I'd give him
[22449.70s -> 22458.58s]  like strong a like above other A's. She focused on made supports like brand Zareth
[22458.58s -> 22462.50s]  or engage like but not unless it depends on your elone it depends on what you're
[22462.50s -> 22476.98s]  doing. I think engage supports in lower elo are bad. I think engage supports in lower elo are bad
[22476.98s -> 22485.41s]  personally because I think that you can be a really good engage player and it doesn't matter
[22485.41s -> 22489.81s]  if your team just gets caught over and over again or if you like make it engage and your team
[22489.81s -> 22495.81s]  misplays right so it's like if you want to play engage supports do it because they are
[22495.81s -> 22501.73s]  better than other like engage supports are better than mages but i think in solo queue mages are
[22501.73s -> 22505.97s]  better to solo carry so it just depends it depends on your elo and it depends on like what
[22505.97s -> 22510.45s]  you're trying to accomplish right because a lot of the time as a support player it's why i play
[22510.45s -> 22517.01s]  senna right like i play senna because i like being able to carry games as support that's why
[22517.01s -> 22524.77s]  i like senna whereas like if you're a um like if i like i can play almost every support right
[22524.77s -> 22527.57s]  I can play Nautilus, I can play Boy- I can play these supports.
[22527.57s -> 22532.45s]  But the problem is, is like I feel bad if like I get like it feels really shitty to get people ahead
[22532.45s -> 22535.65s]  and then have them completely throw their leads over and over again and then tilt and rage and
[22535.65s -> 22540.77s]  shit. So it feels like dog shit. So it's nicer to just like give myself the opportunity to carry
[22540.77s -> 22548.96s]  rather than rely 100% on other people, you know? But I would say the number one thing is
[22550.32s -> 22554.80s]  play what you think is fun. That's just the number one rule. Like playing if you want to
[22554.80s -> 22559.36s]  to win, you can play meta, but the problem is, is if like you're shoving your face and
[22559.36s -> 22562.48s]  are trying to learn a meta champ that you just don't enjoy the playstyle of, you're
[22562.48s -> 22567.12s]  never going to actually be good at the champion because you're like, it's like you're working,
[22567.12s -> 22571.04s]  right? But the best way to learn the champions and learn how to play the game is to have
[22571.04s -> 22574.20s]  fun. Because if you're not having fun at some point, you're not going to be able
[22574.20s -> 22578.00s]  to learn how to play because you're not going to be able to put in the hours or
[22578.00s -> 22581.68s]  put in the games and like be focused during the game, you're going to be frustrated.
[22581.68s -> 22584.24s]  And if you're frustrated, you're not going to be learning. So I would say just
[22584.24s -> 22596.60s]  play something that's fun. The fun aspect is gonna be way more important. Where'd my
[22596.60s -> 22612.18s]  music go? I'm surprised. Can you guys even hear the music half the time? I have it on
[22612.18s -> 22617.02s]  so low that I'm not even sure you guys can hear it. It's just like barely background
[22617.02s -> 22654.69s]  noise. Is this guy holding swap hostage? Join call and I'll swap. Dude, he's holding
[22654.69s -> 22669.24s]  Swap a hostage by the way, if you guys do like the stream, don't forget to follow
[22669.44s -> 22674.92s]  You can scroll down to see all my socials to like tick tock Instagram all that crap
[22675.56s -> 22678.32s]  It's all below the stream. There's like links and shit and
[22686.94s -> 22688.94s]  you know a
[22689.10s -> 22692.22s]  Man's gotta eat you can use your twitch prime too. If you want, you know, you're feeling it
[22692.50s -> 22708.56s]  I'm gonna do a kaisa game. He went lux
[22709.88s -> 22712.40s]  But I kind of want to play kaisa
[22712.40s -> 22717.29s]  What was the voice?
[22717.29s -> 22722.45s]  This is what happens when I get close to the mic.
[22722.45s -> 22724.53s]  I should put the mic in front of my face more.
[22724.53s -> 22726.47s]  The mic's like over to the corner.
[22726.47s -> 22750.34s]  So the mic is like really badly directions.
[22750.34s -> 22757.65s]  This is a cut down game.
[22757.65s -> 22758.65s]  Gragas always use AP.
[22758.65s -> 22759.65s]  He doesn't go tank.
[22759.65s -> 22760.65s]  He goes like AP.
[22760.65s -> 22780.12s]  I kind of want to go last stands.
[22780.12s -> 22781.12s]  That's fine.
[22781.12s -> 22782.12s]  I should have taken ghost.
[22782.12s -> 22784.04s]  Ghost would have been so good this game.
[22784.04s -> 22795.54s]  Tried Kate with shield bow. It's strong. Yeah, it's fun, huh? I love Kate with shield bow. It's so fun
[22796.38s -> 22798.38s]  This would have been such a good ghost game
[22799.44s -> 22801.44s]  I'm frustrated. Oh well
[22802.94s -> 22817.10s]  I like wasn't paying attention. I I always wonder if I should go
[22817.98s -> 22819.98s]  part of me always wants to go like
[22821.34s -> 22825.38s]  Long sword 3 against Thresh and Xayah, but with Kaisa
[22825.38s -> 22829.92s]  I feel like you're on really specific timers with Kaisa. So you have to go like
[22830.58s -> 22832.58s]  It's really important to go
[22832.94s -> 22838.42s]  Doran's so that you can get the Q upgrade timer on the right, you know, like on the right timing. I
[22839.62s -> 22841.86s]  Think getting the Q upgrade timers just so big
[22843.18s -> 22846.58s]  Also this game. I feel like I go Bork this game
[22847.26s -> 22849.26s]  seconds Borker what sends
[22849.94s -> 22855.20s]  If Gragas is not ultra fed. I'll probably go Bork because I don't want to get what's in just for Gragas
[22855.78s -> 22874.93s]  Okay, you started Q. Oh
[22875.21s -> 22877.21s]  Diana's starting on wolves
[22877.77s -> 22907.88s]  Okay, I need to get some coffee after this game. We're getting drowsy. I should have done the middle minion thing. I'm so bad
[22909.40s -> 22911.72s]  Like I should have legitimately just done the thing with the minion
[22912.12s -> 22921.52s]  So when you know thresh starts hook you can still play up right? I can play up I can play aggressive
[22922.04s -> 22941.67s]  I'm bad. I
[22942.03s -> 22943.95s]  Should have just killed the thresh
[22945.07s -> 22947.61s]  This is really bad man. We can't help we can't help
[22950.08s -> 22956.59s]  Because the wave the way the waves going. Oh, I'm so bad. I fucked up. It should be fine
[22956.69s -> 22964.60s]  But I still like it were it it fucks us over early game because they fucked up very badly
[22965.92s -> 22969.56s]  Like I can't stress enough how badly they just fucked up, but it didn't matter
[22971.20s -> 22974.30s]  Okay, that's that's happening apparently
[22975.52s -> 22978.32s]  Don't worry guys. I'm the best Zaya player or Kai'sa player on the server
[22979.00s -> 23008.90s]  It's me. God. I am just literally playing like dog shits. I pick Kai'sa. I just felt like playing her
[23008.90s -> 23016.63s]  We got it back. We have to leave the wave in a bad spot
[23017.53s -> 23031.22s]  Maybe she can push it but like Wukong's here. So yeah, we just okay. We got it. Nice. Not bad
[23032.22s -> 23035.50s]  So we had to push the wave in there so that the wave will bounce back
[23035.78s -> 23037.98s]  But we had to do it on a it was a really bad timer
[23038.34s -> 23042.44s]  Let me just say I fucked up the entire early game of this game like this games. I'm so bad
[23043.70s -> 23048.38s]  Essentially what should have happened was level one when they walked up when Kaisen Thresh walked up level one
[23048.38s -> 23050.98s]  We should have killed them like I should have just straight-up
[23051.38s -> 23056.80s]  Hit the thresh with the Lux because thresh walked into our wave because Wukong was level two ganking
[23056.94s -> 23060.94s]  Should have just killed him. I grieved that and because I went for the Xayah instead
[23060.94s -> 23063.98s]  I put myself in a spot where I took like 80% of my HP for free
[23064.44s -> 23070.34s]  Right, which put me behind and now the entire fight was like harder because I was low and then we had to wait
[23070.34s -> 23072.74s]  For the wait. It was just it was really bad
[23074.30s -> 23075.42s]  Really?
[23075.42s -> 23085.99s]  That minion actually just did that. I don't think we can kill this guy unless she can max range land a Q or something
[23085.99s -> 23095.92s]  But yeah, is there the best ad right now? No, I think Jinx is better. I
[23096.52s -> 23098.08s]  Think Zarya is good
[23098.08s -> 23101.40s]  Her late game, especially with like paired with an enchanter Zarya is insane
[23102.08s -> 23104.76s]  But I think Jinx is better for solo Q
[23106.88s -> 23108.88s]  I actually have to flash
[23113.46s -> 23116.26s]  That was a good play hook by that guy. I disrespected him
[23116.26s -> 23127.60s]  I might have to leave because Wukong can just go here and dive me. I actually just have to leave this feels so bad
[23128.28s -> 23130.28s]  You see how Wukong just used the plants
[23131.88s -> 23137.48s]  If I stay I can just die right so I'm just misplaying all over the place I'm taking too much damage
[23137.48s -> 23139.48s]  We're playing weak side right now, right?
[23139.68s -> 23143.66s]  What I mean by that is like we know our Diana's top and we know they're Wukong's bot
[23143.92s -> 23147.28s]  So because of that I need to play a lot less tradie
[23147.28s -> 23150.92s]  Like I walked up and just let the Thresh flame me for free and I missed two waves now
[23150.92s -> 23156.40s]  I need to not do that because if I don't miss these waves it doesn't matter for weak sighting because I'm not behind so it's
[23156.92s -> 23158.72s]  It's just really stupid
[23158.72s -> 23166.86s]  Now what I do want to do is I want to go check and see if the Wukong's like on our camps or something
[23166.94s -> 23177.36s]  Or if he's doing dragon or some shits. I should not have used the blast cone dude. I am so bad. I
[23178.36s -> 23184.00s]  Used the blast cone to just hit it. It's playing support man. It makes your it makes your brain smaller
[23184.00s -> 23234.02s]  Actually, like I swear playing support makes my brain smaller. Oh, they're in dragon desire is trolling. I
[23235.46s -> 23240.27s]  Think pretty sure I just freeze this no with the Lux
[23240.89s -> 23251.68s]  Yeah, she's just trolling. I don't know what the fuck that was. I took a little bit of damage, but
[23253.24s -> 23275.89s]  She has to overextend now
[23275.89s -> 23277.77s]  No, man. Okay, so
[23277.77s -> 23282.85s]  Does I wanted to back the reason that I froze that was because I wants to back but she can't back until we push
[23282.85s -> 23284.01s]  the wave in
[23284.01s -> 23289.45s]  Or till they push the wave in right? So it gives me time to kind of catch up on my back timer with the Ziya
[23290.25s -> 23292.37s]  Because I'm you know a little bit behind in farm
[23301.49s -> 23303.49s]  Thresh is definitely gonna go mid here
[23304.13s -> 23307.17s]  He's either gonna go mid or he's gonna try and hook us from the bush. I
[23308.85s -> 23313.01s]  Think I'm gonna shoot my W through all of the bushes here. Okay, Thresh isn't in the bushes
[23314.75s -> 23316.75s]  He's just Mia yeah, we don't know where he is
[23317.35s -> 23319.39s]  This is awkward because I can't really walk up
[23319.39s -> 23323.77s]  I mean, I guess I'm almost sick. So I guess I could walk up
[23325.37s -> 23333.90s]  Yeah, there is okay we see him he is level five so it's
[23334.78s -> 23338.34s]  We could probably actually fight like if this guy lands a binding I might be able to just trade
[23338.34s -> 23357.89s]  I just I am I'm dead. I suck. Honestly, I I needed that my bad. I'm playing bad. That's on me
[23359.31s -> 23361.45s]  The locks just playing so good I needed the
[23362.71s -> 23366.17s]  W but then back up after the bind. I've just I'm mechanically
[23366.17s -> 23369.17s]  I'm totally shitting on myself right now, like out of my mouth.
[23369.17s -> 23372.89s]  Just shit.
[23372.89s -> 23375.93s]  Because I knew exactly what was going to happen when I used W in front of the fucking
[23375.93s -> 23376.93s]  Thresh's face.
[23376.93s -> 23380.37s]  I was like, here we go, you know what I mean?
[23380.37s -> 23384.45s]  Technically we're both six and he's five, but it doesn't matter because if I get hooked,
[23384.45s -> 23385.45s]  I don't have enough damage.
[23385.45s -> 23398.07s]  So now here, I'm going to walk up and see if I can stop the Xayah's back maybe.
[23398.07s -> 23401.29s]  Maybe she's backing in a weird spot.
[23401.29s -> 23402.93s]  Yeah, we stopped their backs.
[23402.93s -> 23403.93s]  Huge.
[23403.93s -> 23411.93s]  they're in trouble. So they really needed the back on that timer. Because they just
[23411.93s -> 23418.01s]  want to fight, right? And because they just want to fight, they want to go back, right?
[23418.01s -> 23427.42s]  No way. Dude, fuck off. I cannot dodge a hook right now to save my fucking life.
[23427.42s -> 23443.01s]  Jesus Christ. What is my movements, man? Like tilting myself right now. I want to
[23443.01s -> 23453.89s]  stay for this wave but mid is mia yeah i can't it feels so bad because i needed one more wave to
[23453.89s -> 23460.13s]  get double pickaxe so i can get my upgrade because like normally you go noon quiver pickaxe pickaxe
[23460.13s -> 23464.85s]  if you go noon pick pick it gives you enough ad to get your q upgrade right and that's like the
[23464.85s -> 23467.81s]  whole point you don't need kraken you just need your q upgrade because your q upgrades when you
[23467.81s -> 23473.01s]  start bursting but because i got hooked under the turrets even though we got a kill i had
[23473.01s -> 23488.24s]  to back and i couldn't get my timer i'm so trash i need some coffee that's what it is man i swear
[23488.24s -> 23522.12s]  to god coffee is my savior it'll save me this world is changing that wave actually just did
[23522.12s -> 23547.81s]  that to me holy shit we don't actually have to do anything here crazy nice well played nice
[23558.61s -> 23573.06s]  nice nice nice that was a good 2v2 all right i got my q upgrade now we're chilling oh now
[23573.06s -> 23585.99s]  we're hella chillin oh yeah baby you know what it is it's like uh i'm playing the fights too quick
[23591.68s -> 23607.35s]  i just got to slow down and like think i'm like too hyped up i really don't want to miss this
[23607.35s -> 23615.03s]  wave there's a person right there oh shit let's go yeah he's dead okay i'm gonna go farm bot
[23615.03s -> 23633.56s]  while that guy gets that the slux is really good i kind of want to oh i can't get this
[23633.56s -> 23648.26s]  play it fuck what what that was bs okay you know what i'll just take my entire hp bar really quick
[23648.26s -> 23653.38s]  on the turret it's not a big deal guys i'm just i'm that good at the game like i don't mean to
[23653.38s -> 23660.08s]  brag but like you know professional gamer over here like you know i'm gonna be wanting some
[23660.08s -> 23689.80s]  lessons like i got you dude look how big my shield is wait you son of a bitch
[23691.88s -> 23707.67s]  I mean she's dead but
[23707.67s -> 23712.07s]  I got out playing man
[23713.11s -> 23726.76s]  Motherfucker
[23726.76s -> 23728.76s]  All right, they forfeit it. Nice
[23730.20s -> 23733.17s]  Oh
[23733.17s -> 23736.21s]  Well, I need to make some coffee i'm playing give me a sec
[23737.33s -> 23739.33s]  We're playing real bad. I need some coffee
[23753.59s -> 23759.75s]  Nice though. We hit 400 lp. Let's go. So now we just need 150 more. We need 550. I think 550 is gm
[23772.87s -> 23774.87s]  I didn't do anything that game by the way. I did nothing
[23774.87s -> 23781.39s]  I can play another AD carry game that was fun. I'm gonna grab some coffee. I'll be right back
[23782.79s -> 23785.75s]  Talks amongst yourselves boys. I believe in you
[23786.83s -> 23790.39s]  You can look at my AD carry tier list that we've been trying to figure out how to do
[23791.23s -> 23793.97s]  Enjoy, I'll be ready grab some coffee. Oh
[23795.67s -> 23902.02s]  Fucking a all right. I'm back. Let's go the book
[23902.02s -> 23906.48s]  Oh, sweet.
[23906.48s -> 23911.62s]  We back, boys.
[23911.62s -> 23914.89s]  We back.
[23914.89s -> 23918.67s]  Time is it five?
[23918.67s -> 23919.67s]  Ooh.
[23919.67s -> 23927.51s]  I could probably play for like another hour and then I gotta get off and make some dinner.
[23927.51s -> 23929.25s]  Do some other shit.
[23929.25s -> 23930.25s]  You know what I'm saying?
[23930.25s -> 23940.44s]  Where were we?
[23940.44s -> 23941.78s]  Oh yeah, we're making the tier list.
[23941.78s -> 23947.50s]  Yeah, I think Varus is really good at A. I think Varus is good at A tier, because
[23947.50s -> 23953.04s]  In my opinion, Varus is never really like a bad pick almost like sometimes he's bad
[23953.04s -> 23957.84s]  But I think he's just you can play him on hit or you can play him without e right
[23957.84s -> 23962.64s]  So he's got two builds that you can do based on the game and the team comp. His ulti is pretty much always useful
[23963.52s -> 23967.50s]  Like just having a stun like a root on a champion is always gonna be useful
[23967.50s -> 23972.96s]  Right, then you have he's got very long range like engage. He can safely kill people with his ult in his Q
[23973.54s -> 23977.34s]  You can build him poke or like before objectives. You can make picks really easily
[23977.34s -> 23979.34s]  You can poke people out before the objective get him low
[23979.86s -> 23984.62s]  His lane phase is really good. If you're if you understand like how to play Varus his lane phase is exceptional
[23984.82s -> 23986.82s]  He also has
[23987.74s -> 23990.82s]  In the meta currently I feel like he's just like a good pick
[23990.82s -> 23995.34s]  I don't think he's as good as Draven and Jinx for solo queue, but I do think he's really good
[23996.06s -> 23998.66s]  In general you can you can climb with them really easily
[23999.66s -> 24002.10s]  And then I put Ashe here, too
[24002.90s -> 24005.34s]  Maybe Ashe. I don't know who I'd put in front
[24005.34s -> 24013.34s]  Ash or Varus? I feel like maybe Ash or maybe Varus. I think Ash is really underrated though. I think Ash is super super good right now
[24013.34s -> 24027.34s]  I think Ash is super good
[24027.94s -> 24029.42s]  because
[24029.42s -> 24031.42s]  Sorry, I'm trying to think
[24032.34s -> 24036.34s]  She's basically the same idea as Varus. She's a little different, but she's the same idea. Um
[24038.26s -> 24042.56s]  She controls lane phase pretty well, right like her lane isn't too bad. She also has
[24042.56s -> 24044.56s]  as
[24044.56s -> 24048.76s]  Like her are always useful no matter what so like you'll always have use with ash
[24048.76s -> 24053.20s]  You'll always have use with various are like they just stuns snares etc. And so look here
[24053.84s -> 24058.24s]  she's also really good at being annoying in team fights like you can take ghost on ash and you can just
[24058.48s -> 24061.96s]  volley sit outside the range and if you just be basically slow people and
[24062.36s -> 24064.32s]  She actually has decent scaling on her crit now
[24064.32s -> 24068.12s]  So you can go a bunch of builds to like I think you can go Bork ash
[24068.12s -> 24074.08s]  You can go Kraken Slayer Ashe into Bork or you could go Kraken Slayer into Aiee or you can go Kraken Slayer into like
[24075.56s -> 24079.98s]  Whatever you can go Shieldbow Ashe if they have tanks you can go Galeforce that or you can just do a lot of different
[24079.98s -> 24084.00s]  Builds on Ashe and I think she's really versatile. You could also just go the On-Head build if you really want I
[24084.00s -> 24087.98s]  I think the Rageblade build sucks. Personally. I think that if I was gonna go on hit
[24087.98s -> 24090.64s]  I would just be like Shieldbow Wits End into like
[24091.08s -> 24096.34s]  Bork or some shit if I was actually gonna do that or Shieldbow Bork or Bork Wits or whatever, but
[24097.18s -> 24103.71s]  Yeah, I don't know Ezreal's probably a tier two. I
[24105.07s -> 24107.23s]  Said as well as really gated by like skill
[24107.83s -> 24112.03s]  So I don't want to put him in I think if you could play Ezreal perfectly
[24112.03s -> 24114.95s]  He'd be at the top of ass like he would just be above jinx
[24115.35s -> 24121.11s]  Just best champion in the game if you could if you could never miss a skillshot like a hundred percent accuracy playing perfect
[24121.11s -> 24122.59s]  Like the champs insane, right?
[24122.59s -> 24127.83s]  It's absolutely crazy how good that champ is if you can play him perfect, but here like people are humans, etc
[24127.83s -> 24132.71s]  So I think he's like an A tier pick in solo queue because you can get countered like he's not blindable
[24132.71s -> 24134.71s]  You can get countered pretty easily by good players
[24135.15s -> 24139.19s]  People play like push comps people play dive comps like early game
[24139.19s -> 24142.67s]  I mean in lane and shits like cuz Ezreal's lane is like not it's not bad
[24142.85s -> 24147.51s]  But it's very difficult to play Ezreal well in lane you got to be good mechanically
[24147.51s -> 24152.07s]  And I don't think even like I've seen like challenger players who can't play Ezreal so
[24153.07s -> 24155.07s]  He's not easy
[24155.39s -> 24156.87s]  You know what I'm saying?
[24156.87s -> 24197.42s]  What's up boys, so I was gonna ban Kindred, but I couldn't find her I
[24198.90s -> 24228.58s]  Hate Kindred. Yo, how we doing tonight? How's everybody's day? Okay, so this guy's picking Thresh again
[24229.28s -> 24285.70s]  Thresh into Rekhan Thresh is actually pretty good in the Rekhan. They have Xayah Thresh again. Let's play Jinx. I like Jinx here
[24287.14s -> 24291.70s]  Even though it is against Thresh Jinx is a little scary, right? But I kind of like her in this situation
[24292.54s -> 24300.90s]  See what runs do I want free boots?
[24300.90s -> 24309.19s]  Nah, I think I want I want to be able to get early boots this game because their team comp is like, oh
[24310.09s -> 24313.41s]  Yeah, their team comes really really annoying. So I kind of want to get
[24315.41s -> 24320.41s]  Early boots I'll probably go presence of mind
[24321.49s -> 24323.49s]  Although I think over hill isn't bad
[24327.26s -> 24329.26s]  Actually, I'll go over hill
[24329.66s -> 24333.46s]  So yeah, these runes look good. Actually, let's do this
[24335.10s -> 24336.86s]  Or this
[24336.86s -> 24347.43s]  This yeah, this is good. Okay. I kind of like these this is good. I'm gonna use these. Okay
[24347.91s -> 24349.91s]  I'm taking claims this game because
[24350.37s -> 24354.63s]  They have Lissandra and Pantheon and Thresh right so with Lissandra Pantheon and Thresh
[24356.47s -> 24360.71s]  The game's gonna be like really fast of like, okay if they stun me
[24360.71s -> 24364.35s]  I'm just gonna get CC chained and I'm just gonna die like after a bit, right?
[24364.75s -> 24367.69s]  It's gonna be like a stun and they're starting and they're starting and I'm just gonna die
[24367.69s -> 24401.68s]  So I'm like nah, fuck that shit. Let's see if we can get this W boys
[24402.38s -> 24417.53s]  Let's see if I can not fuck up the first three levels of the lane. Got chat restricted? Oh, yeah
[24418.39s -> 24419.95s]  It's for a while
[24419.95s -> 24448.65s]  It's Riot's secret code to make it so I can actually play the game and climb without chatting. Okay, I
[24449.41s -> 24451.41s]  Should have warded this bush. I
[24453.49s -> 24457.33s]  Was drinking my coffee I didn't think about it, but yeah if you guys are against the hook champ
[24458.21s -> 24459.97s]  Always ward this bush
[24459.97s -> 24464.95s]  Right like right here. You're gonna want to
[24465.87s -> 24468.03s]  Ward here early against most hook champions
[24469.15s -> 24471.43s]  Because it gives you a very nice
[24472.03s -> 24477.07s]  Like they can't walk in here and cheese you they can't walk in here and cheese you so you just don't get cheesed
[24477.51s -> 24511.36s]  By anything. I mean, that's just I don't even know what I just saw
[24512.72s -> 24515.28s]  I'll be real. I don't know what the fuck just happened. But okay
[24516.52s -> 24518.52s]  Trying to push this wave as fast as I can
[24518.52s -> 24534.12s]  I'm not sure I can actually get it pushed fast enough, but we're gonna try it was close
[24539.44s -> 24542.82s]  No, I'm gonna let it just push. It's not a huge deal
[24543.66s -> 24545.66s]  It was very close though
[24545.88s -> 24553.34s]  We can just break the freeze right? Like it's not a huge deal. Are they supposed to win level one?
[24554.02s -> 24557.92s]  It depends. I mean Ziya is not that good level one like
[24558.34s -> 24560.86s]  She's I it's good because she has her feathers, right?
[24560.90s -> 24564.42s]  but if you can't stack your feathers level one jinx has more damage and
[24564.42s -> 24567.26s]  And they stacked up for my gap or for my rocket
[24567.26s -> 24573.92s]  So I got like I full stacked my lethal tempo and I just double a we rocketed them over and over and over and over again
[24573.92s -> 24577.62s]  right, and so
[24577.68s -> 24580.66s]  When they finally all end they were just behind an HP
[24581.96s -> 24612.95s]  Also, Thresh missed he only had to flay him. That was so close, man
[24613.85s -> 24634.06s]  Like actually if Thresh had died there or not Thresh if Graves had died there. We just win the game
[24634.62s -> 24650.99s]  Yeah, this isn't good. Oh, I'm gonna get flight. I'm dead
[24652.29s -> 24655.19s]  Maybe oh, maybe I'm not dead. I have to walk up like this
[24656.93s -> 24660.37s]  It was a really bad fight by the what what am I watching what the fuck
[24662.01s -> 24664.09s]  That was with a bad fight because um
[24665.45s -> 24669.47s]  We knew graves with bot and we knew that he was gonna kill in the jungle, right?
[24670.15s -> 24674.29s]  So like my jungler already got outplayed by graves once topside
[24674.29s -> 24679.97s]  You shouldn't ever take another fight like that bot side. You should just take the win, right? Like I rotated
[24680.71s -> 24684.21s]  Now granted the Rakan should have been there to help kill the Graves
[24684.67s -> 24688.71s]  Like when I rotated Rakan was still jacking off in lane, right?
[24688.71s -> 24693.25s]  Like when I was here Rakan was like way down here. So the support should have rotated first
[24694.39s -> 24697.31s]  Right, like I rotated but the support should have been the one rotating
[24697.31s -> 24702.29s]  But again, he's just a lot of the time you have support players who don't understand timers and I had to help
[24702.29s -> 24709.29s]  Nobody plays for jungle. Support players hate playing for jungle in low elo, so it's just not a thing.
[24710.29s -> 24715.29s]  So I tried to go over and help him, but I misplaced my traps a little bit.
[24716.29s -> 24719.29s]  And then the Graves had a flash, but he got away.
[24720.29s -> 24724.29s]  And they tried to go in again when I was too low to actually help.
[24725.29s -> 24727.29s]  We just got lucky we didn't lose the game off that shit.
[24727.29s -> 24750.71s]  off that shit. Kind of does suck though. Xayah's really strong now. Oh not bad. I should have,
[24750.71s -> 24758.54s]  oh I should have, I could have killed her. I suppose I could have killed the guy. No joke,
[24758.54s -> 24763.90s]  I totally could have killed him. If I had warded the lantern as he tried to take it, I would
[24763.90s -> 24780.38s]  have killed the Xayah because she ego'd the lantern there. She ego'd the lantern so hard. If
[24780.38s -> 24796.86s]  I had if I had warded it, she dies there. That's my bad. This game's really interesting
[24796.86s -> 24803.66s]  because the enemy bot lane is actually misplaying a lot like they're they're really really really
[24803.66s -> 24811.66s]  misplaying these fights and trades and shit but uh we can't abuse it because the graves has so
[24811.66s -> 24816.78s]  much control of the game right now that we have to basically play safe permanently at the moment
[24816.78s -> 24820.14s]  and i can't do anything to help my team it feels really bad
[24820.14s -> 24839.18s]  Oh my guys again. Yeah, everyone. See you look graves have bought again, man. This is so rough
[24848.57s -> 24855.22s]  Graves is man. I want to kill this as fast as I can
[24855.74s -> 24867.42s]  We can fight these guys to be too actually
[24867.94s -> 24885.80s]  Wait, why didn't he just go in? I don't know why he didn't just double you immediately like there were con waited
[24885.80s -> 24887.48s]  Oh that tilts me
[24887.48s -> 24894.68s]  like when she was against the wall here, he should have immediately w'd her because
[24894.68s -> 24900.16s]  Because if he W's from vision there right and and she's against the wall it helps us
[24900.16s -> 24906.68s]  so much because then I can I can overlay my flame chomps on top of the I can overlay my
[24906.68s -> 24911.92s]  flame chomps directly on top of the Zaya right as the fights happening rather than
[24911.92s -> 24920.62s]  like having to work around the fight because Thresh is in my face type shit you know
[24920.62s -> 24923.26s]  so we're just we're honestly just losing because we're not pulling the trigger fast
[24923.26s -> 24931.34s]  enough and we can't play aggressive when we can pull the trigger right like
[24931.34s -> 24933.34s]  we're losing cuz we can't pull the trigger fast enough and when we can pull
[24933.34s -> 24941.10s]  the trigger it's the wrong time we do this right now we get dragon the
[24941.10s -> 24956.44s]  ball in back do we get dragon here I want to go I actually want to go with
[24956.44s -> 24963.98s]  the enemy balling didn't back okay they're trolling they lost an objective
[24963.98s -> 24967.38s]  for free here this is really good so the enemy ball in we fight this by
[24967.38s -> 24982.94s]  We just we can just straight-up fight that right there is how you Lancer are you more to Lancer by the way? Oh?
[24985.32s -> 24987.32s]  I did that guy so dirty. Oh
[24992.20s -> 24994.20s]  I'm dead. Bye guys. I
[25000.97s -> 25003.17s]  Didn't know pantheon was Mia. That was my bad. I
[25004.41s -> 25007.13s]  Was like going I was too happy with warding the lantern
[25009.48s -> 25018.52s]  My bad. I can't believe the enemy team greeted that hard though for gold
[25019.16s -> 25024.65s]  Well, that's actually nuts to me
[25024.65s -> 25036.54s]  No, yeah, the Ziya's egoing like crazy.
[25036.54s -> 25041.42s]  The problem is, I can't abuse it constantly because like obviously like I need teammates,
[25041.42s -> 25042.42s]  right?
[25042.42s -> 25052.21s]  I can kind of abuse it like, but it's much harder by yourself.
[25052.21s -> 25056.73s]  Because as you can see, like I'm not playing poorly, but we're getting like we're getting
[25056.73s -> 25057.73s]  shit on.
[25057.73s -> 25059.25s]  Shit on is a bad word.
[25059.25s -> 25081.05s]  We're getting like, oh, come on, man.
[25081.05s -> 25085.95s]  They misplayed that so badly.
[25085.95s -> 25091.63s]  But Rakan just ate the fucking whatever I'm not gonna blame Rakan it's fine.
[25091.63s -> 25092.97s]  I'm still sad about that though.
[25092.97s -> 25096.71s]  They misplayed that so incredibly badly.
[25096.71s -> 25098.89s]  Like so badly.
[25098.89s -> 25102.47s]  It was just that like Rakan all in the Thresh with his ultimate.
[25102.47s -> 25107.15s]  But all he had to do there was use his E to come back to me and then play front
[25107.15s -> 25108.65s]  to back afterward.
[25108.65s -> 25111.95s]  But he's he's out there autoing the Thresh.
[25111.95s -> 25112.95s]  But you don't need to auto him.
[25112.95s -> 25121.73s]  need to engage and then i can maybe play after it i probably could have double killed them there
[25121.73s -> 25130.84s]  too i kind of messed up my team wants out it's not it's it's silly because the game's not even over
[25134.93s -> 25140.85s]  like we actually can win this game so incredibly easily so easily if we just play it correctly
[25141.41s -> 25145.25s]  because their bot lane is really fucking bad i didn't want to be mean but
[25145.25s -> 25155.74s]  but I'll just be mean, their bot lane's really fucking bad.
[25155.74s -> 25156.74s]  Well, I'm dead.
[25157.58s -> 25158.58s]  They're still bad.
[25160.42s -> 25162.98s]  I'm just egoing, that was my ego.
[25165.26s -> 25168.08s]  I still stand by it, I still think they're bad.
[25168.08s -> 25169.72s]  This guy's just playing 1v3 mid.
[25169.72s -> 25171.88s]  The Thresh has not been mid one time,
[25171.88s -> 25179.03s]  so it must be the top laner.
[25179.03s -> 25186.02s]  I am so frustrated right now with this game,
[25186.02s -> 25188.46s]  because I feel like we should have won so many all-ins
[25188.46s -> 25194.54s]  We didn't win barely like one like barely right like barely didn't win small ends. I thought we should have won all of them
[25196.62s -> 25200.62s]  Like they they didn't land like a good all-in once Thresh didn't land a single hook once
[25201.50s -> 25202.62s]  and
[25202.62s -> 25207.22s]  This is my Rakan like he just tried to he just used his R to try and engage
[25207.30s -> 25215.44s]  I think Nocturne is done mentally
[25216.20s -> 25221.17s]  Okay, so in games like this
[25221.37s -> 25225.07s]  Like this Thresh is so bad. Oh
[25248.21s -> 25250.21s]  Let's go, baby
[25250.65s -> 25255.42s]  Huge
[25255.42s -> 25257.42s]  That was so huge. Let's fucking go
[25275.10s -> 25280.92s]  Like I I'm gonna hit no at 15 because dude, I really don't want to lose to this Thresh and Nasaya
[25282.50s -> 25286.80s]  Like this Thresh is doing the most the most ego shit I've ever seen and
[25287.88s -> 25292.68s]  He's just getting away with shit like right there Thresh walks up whiffs every spell
[25294.10s -> 25300.02s]  And expects to get away with that shit. Nah, no, no, we win these we win these trust give me let me cook
[25300.02s -> 25303.46s]  Let me cook. I just need my team to let me cook a bit, you know?
[25304.82s -> 25308.98s]  Like we had a bad early game had to play weak side. Let me cook. Let me cook
[25310.74s -> 25343.68s]  We are chilling
[25343.68s -> 25375.16s]  Oh if I landed that that would have been sick the rest is top two. We can kill this guy
[25383.44s -> 25385.44s]  Come on guys. Don't forfeit
[25385.60s -> 25387.84s]  Guys, the game is winnable. Oh my god
[25389.20s -> 25392.32s]  Dude the game is how is the rakan gonna forfeit?
[25392.32s -> 25409.16s]  dude that game is so winnable it hurts like dude really that actually is so
[25409.16s -> 25417.70s]  infuriating that's so infuriating man that game was so incredibly winnable
[25417.70s -> 25424.07s]  like look at this I did more damage than every single player on the enemy
[25424.07s -> 25432.01s]  team if my team just relaxed we win the game a thousand times over that
[25432.01s -> 25439.77s]  game. Like the game is over. We have a Rakan, a Rumble, and a Wukong for me to sit and sit behind.
[25440.49s -> 25445.37s]  And we saw how bad their bot lane was, right? I have cleanse for the only way they can kill me
[25447.31s -> 25451.87s]  ever, man. Dude, I wish to God I'm gonna report them all. Like these fuckers, I guarantee I get
[25451.87s -> 25459.04s]  a notification. There's no way these people are not toxic. There's no way you in this,
[25459.04s -> 25463.44s]  Like you just want out of the game after a fucking your team is just doing well
[25464.96s -> 25468.12s]  No, man, the score is 10 to 14
[25469.20s -> 25471.20s]  10 to 14
[25472.12s -> 25475.88s]  You have a fed 80 carry
[25476.44s -> 25483.82s]  Look at this dude. We forfeited we were down
[25484.52s -> 25492.72s]  2.5 K we had a better scaling comp than them like we outscale them
[25492.72s -> 25502.52s]  We have two dragons, we outscale them, and we're down 2.5k.
[25502.52s -> 25505.40s]  And my team rage hits forfeit.
[25505.40s -> 25510.24s]  Oh my god, that's so gross.
[25510.24s -> 25518.24s]  That is so disgusting.
[25518.24s -> 25524.56s]  So disgusting.
[25524.56s -> 25528.88s]  Why am I in a game with this player?
[25528.88s -> 25533.44s]  I'm 412 LP Masters.
[25533.44s -> 25541.78s]  I was in a game just now with a 7 LP Masters jungler and he's not on a smurf.
[25541.78s -> 25549.57s]  This is not a smurf account because last season this guy was D4.
[25549.57s -> 25551.51s]  So he's not on a smurf.
[25551.51s -> 25556.50s]  Why is this player in my game?
[25556.50s -> 25561.02s]  Why is this player in a 400 LP Master game?
[25561.02s -> 25562.02s]  Why?
[25562.02s -> 25569.83s]  Or rather, why am I in a Diamond 1 game?
[25569.83s -> 25573.67s]  You can go to his previous games, he doesn't even have good MMR.
[25573.67s -> 25578.39s]  Like if you look at these games, they're all like what, 100, 200 LP, right?
[25578.39s -> 25579.69s]  Why am I in this game?
[25579.69s -> 25583.31s]  Why did you put me in a game with this player?
[25583.31s -> 25585.55s]  Like this guy, I don't even care if he sucks.
[25585.55s -> 25590.27s]  I'm more frustrated the fact that these players mental boom at the first sign of
[25590.27s -> 25591.27s]  any negativity.
[25591.27s -> 25593.07s]  Look at this.
[25593.07s -> 25594.21s]  They just give up.
[25594.21s -> 25598.03s]  First sign of anything negative, they go next.
[25598.03s -> 25603.47s]  I actually could have 1v9'd this game too, but I'm not allowed to try and 1v9 because
[25603.47s -> 25607.95s]  my team wants out of the game at 15 minutes.
[25607.95s -> 25610.71s]  That sucks man.
[25610.71s -> 25614.79s]  The new system is trash.
[25614.79s -> 25618.51s]  The 4v15 system is good sometimes.
[25618.51s -> 25621.95s]  They should have a requirement that you have to be losing by x amount of gold
[25621.95s -> 25624.55s]  for it to kick in.
[25624.55s -> 25626.09s]  That should be it.
[25626.09s -> 25627.79s]  They should have a requirement.
[25627.79s -> 25634.44s]  You have to be losing by 5k plus for it to work at 15.
[25634.44s -> 25641.08s]  Like there needs to be something where there's a requirement because people are so stupid.
[25641.08s -> 25642.08s]  Right?
[25642.08s -> 25643.94s]  Like that game was 100% ours.
[25643.94s -> 25644.94s]  We had two dragons.
[25644.94s -> 25650.44s]  We're down 2000 gold at 16 minutes and Wukong's three and one.
[25650.44s -> 25651.72s]  We were done four kills.
[25651.72s -> 25656.88s]  Wukong's three and one.
[25656.88s -> 25661.64s]  I'm, I'm, I'm literally insanely strong.
[25661.64s -> 25663.56s]  Even though we got weak side, I'm still winning.
[25663.56s -> 25665.56s]  We just 2v2'ed them bot side of the map, right?
[25665.56s -> 25668.86s]  We just won a 2v2.
[25668.86s -> 25674.02s]  Rumble's just like, like, haaah, sorry, I'm just mad, I'm mad.
[25674.02s -> 25677.68s]  Like they need to require, they need to require something other than four people, like
[25677.68s -> 25685.14s]  require four people and a gold lead or something, like that's so cancer.
[25685.14s -> 25689.62s]  That's so fucking frustrating, man.
[25689.62s -> 25693.32s]  Like I can't believe how bad people's mentals are.
[25693.32s -> 25695.48s]  Like the, the, okay, I get it.
[25695.48s -> 25699.64s]  The rumble and the nocturne, I understand wanting to forfeit, okay?
[25699.64s -> 25703.08s]  Okay, they're having a bad game, they want out, they're raging, they need to get their
[25703.08s -> 25704.08s]  frustration.
[25704.08s -> 25705.08s]  I get it.
[25705.08s -> 25712.98s]  But why are we forfeiting when Wukong is 3-1?
[25712.98s -> 25717.78s]  I have 7 of our KP, I'm the AD carry, I just got my mythic.
[25717.78s -> 25720.08s]  We have 2 dragons.
[25720.08s -> 25721.34s]  And Rakan's forfeiting too?
[25721.34s -> 25726.88s]  I don't know, man.
[25726.88s -> 25737.96s]  just frustrating as all like I'll be real I carry this game every day of the week every
[25737.96s -> 25769.45s]  day of the week I carry those so apparently riot is doing something about smurfing though
[25769.45s -> 25775.03s]  and I can't wait until they do this is actually a really good thing that I wanted that
[25775.03s -> 25779.09s]  I wanted to talk about earlier in the stream but I forgot apparently riot is like doing
[25779.09s -> 25782.87s]  something to make smurfing harder because like apparently smurfing is outrageous right
[25782.87s -> 25790.71s]  now. And I kind of think that they need to stop this too. So there's a there's a thing you can do
[25790.71s -> 25797.43s]  in solo queue right now, where you can make a new account. And you can do with somebody
[25799.03s -> 25806.07s]  on different accounts on a new account. And your MMR doesn't actually get like lowered.
[25806.07s -> 25817.15s]  So, if you win a game, let's say you win a game, um, I think this is just him leveling
[25817.15s -> 25824.02s]  the account, but let's say, let's say you win a game and in that game, you do it with
[25824.02s -> 25826.44s]  somebody in a lower MMR, right?
[25826.44s -> 25829.88s]  Now when you do it in a lower MMR, I don't know if this guy did this or not, but
[25829.88s -> 25834.96s]  when you do it with somebody in a lower MMR, your MMR is based on, now the game
[25834.96s -> 25839.24s]  thinks that you're in that MMR and you can do it in placements.
[25839.24s -> 25843.88s]  So in your very first games, for some reason, there's no MMR lock on placements.
[25843.88s -> 25850.66s]  So you can, in your placements, duo with somebody who's like bronze, right?
[25850.66s -> 25852.40s]  And you can play with them.
[25852.40s -> 25857.42s]  And then the game thinks you're still winning, so it keeps amplifying your MMR.
[25857.42s -> 25861.56s]  So I'm describing this really poorly, but essentially you can duo in lower ELOs, and
[25861.56s -> 25866.12s]  the game doesn't know your MMR belongs in that ELO, because you're winning in
[25866.12s -> 25867.12s]  that ELO.
[25867.12s -> 25870.38s]  The game can't figure that out for some reason, the algorithm.
[25870.38s -> 25875.32s]  So when they stopped duo queuing, it still inflated them.
[25875.32s -> 25879.30s]  It still inflated their MMR to where it would be if they had solo queued.
[25879.30s -> 25880.42s]  Does that make sense?
[25880.42s -> 25881.90s]  And what I'm saying?
[25881.90s -> 25886.22s]  So it basically says that they went like 10 and 0 in their placements, right?
[25886.22s -> 25891.56s]  So now they're in like a master tier MMR from a brand new account.
[25891.56s -> 25899.45s]  So now those people are in like D1 Masters MMR, but they played, they won in gold.
[25899.45s -> 25909.83s]  I also don't think smurfing should be so easily accessible.
[25909.83s -> 25914.63s]  Like this guy's not a bad player per se, but I don't think he's a master tier player.
[25914.63s -> 25917.95s]  Like this guy's a rumble player on a new account.
[25917.95s -> 25940.05s]  From that game alone, the fact he gave up tells me he's not a good player.
[25940.05s -> 25957.53s]  I'm a heavy advocate for having to attach verification to play ranked.
[25957.53s -> 25961.88s]  I think it would be great.
[25961.88s -> 25975.23s]  I think it would help so much.
[25975.23s -> 25977.47s]  If you get your verified account banned, are you done for?
[25977.47s -> 25978.47s]  Yeah.
[25978.47s -> 25981.19s]  You have to get a VPN to play.
[25981.19s -> 25983.93s]  That's my point though.
[25983.93s -> 26019.98s]  If you get your verified account banned, that account is done.
[26019.98s -> 26027.38s]  People who get banned on accounts typically get banned consistently.
[26027.38s -> 26031.86s]  So you're telling me somebody is going to be willing to pay $5 for a new phone number
[26031.86s -> 26036.18s]  verification or whatever every time they have to make a new account?
[26036.18s -> 26047.66s]  They're not.
[26047.66s -> 26048.66s]  Not Yumi.
[26048.66s -> 26051.78s]  Lulu, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[26051.78s -> 26052.78s]  Don't I have Smurfs?
[26052.78s -> 26053.78s]  Yeah, I do.
[26053.78s -> 26059.86s]  And I stand by, all my Smurfs should be attached to the same account.
[26059.86s -> 26064.56s]  Like if you make a Smurf, okay, this is what I think should happen.
[26064.56s -> 26067.50s]  You should be able to put all of your Smurfs on one account.
[26067.50s -> 26073.94s]  So you can make Smurfs and you can add that Smurf verification to an account.
[26073.94s -> 26074.94s]  But it kind of like battle.net.
[26074.94s -> 26075.94s]  Does that make sense?
[26075.94s -> 26080.46s]  You know, like battle.net has all your accounts in the battle.net thing, but you can sign
[26080.46s -> 26082.14s]  into battle.net.
[26082.14s -> 26086.98s]  I think that the way to make it make it viable would be like you could put all if
[26086.98s -> 26090.86s]  you didn't have a second phone number, didn't want one, you could put Smurfs up
[26090.86s -> 26091.86s]  to like a limit.
[26091.86s -> 26094.66s]  So you could have like three Smurfs or like two Smurfs and your main account,
[26094.66s -> 26095.66s]  right?
[26095.66s -> 26100.06s]  three total accounts and you you would have to like you could add those to the
[26100.06s -> 26104.38s]  same like oh omega account right and that omega account could be your
[26104.38s -> 26108.18s]  verified account now if any of your accounts get punished on your omega
[26108.18s -> 26116.16s]  account all of your accounts get punished so if any of your accounts get
[26116.16s -> 26131.42s]  punished all of them get punished like I feel like that'd be a good play
[26131.42s -> 26133.82s]  maybe I'm wrong but I feel like it would work
[26133.82s -> 26142.79s]  yo what's up brush I cause you brush what's up RF what do I want to play
[26142.79s -> 26149.00s]  I don't know. I don't know what I want to do here.
[26149.00s -> 26153.00s]  Self-arranged, okay. I wish I didn't have cleanse.
[26153.00s -> 26157.00s]  Cleanse is so worthless this game, like actually.
[26157.00s -> 26161.00s]  Cleanse does nothing this game at all. I'm just down a sum.
[26161.00s -> 26165.00s]  Like maybe if the brand tries to flash stun me or some shit.
[26165.00s -> 26181.26s]  But I'm just like down a summoner. Alright boys.
[26181.26s -> 26192.55s]  We got Knight Blue 3 on our team. This is a throwback.
[26247.69s -> 26258.36s]  Him oh we got him. I'm not gonna lie. I kind of looked like I was scripting
[26260.10s -> 26264.06s]  That that movement like if I was watching the game I'd be like what the fuck was that?
[26265.86s -> 26267.98s]  Like my movement was real sauce
[26268.70s -> 26273.82s]  On that like that that all in right there. That's some that's some business movement
[26305.55s -> 26308.67s]  We can gank these guys. They have no oh, there's gonna be a ward in here
[26311.23s -> 26320.94s]  These people have no flashes
[26321.58s -> 26324.78s]  Enemy bot lane has no flash. This should be be a free kill honestly
[26326.10s -> 26329.94s]  We just let these guys push in they can't walk up and we just play for that
[26334.78s -> 26347.77s]  Even if they try in 3v3, we should just win the 3v3 because we're stronger. Oh, this guy's just dead. Yeah, that's I
[26358.38s -> 26360.38s]  need level 3 I
[26363.02s -> 26365.02s]  Kind of fucked my entire wave here
[26366.10s -> 26378.51s]  Yo, can we push is there any way we can just push this? Oh nice
[26389.58s -> 26391.58s]  Nice well played
[26392.58s -> 26394.02s]  Nice job
[26394.02s -> 26396.48s]  My Lulu's fucking fed as shit. Oh
[26404.28s -> 26406.28s]  I should have gone free boots this game. I
[26407.16s -> 26409.16s]  Didn't think about it
[26409.84s -> 26414.60s]  Cuz uh, I don't need sork this game, you know, I was like the last game
[26414.60s -> 26417.12s]  I told you I was going boots. I went boots for the
[26418.28s -> 26422.60s]  You know the fast boot to rush for Thresh. I don't need that this game because
[26423.46s -> 26425.70s]  We just went through like faster mythic
[26425.70s -> 26433.18s]  So I should have gone free boots for like more efficiency.
[26433.18s -> 26445.02s]  Can't understand, and I could just kill a man.
[26445.02s -> 26469.33s]  You can't understand, and I could just kill a man.
[26469.33s -> 26473.09s]  I want to push this wave so we don't get like shit on.
[26473.09s -> 26503.17s]  I'm gonna just kill a man.
[26503.17s -> 26505.87s]  You can't understand.
[26505.87s -> 26507.87s]  Just kill a man.
[26507.87s -> 26514.71s]  Tell a man there is something you can't understand
[26515.99s -> 26544.27s]  Give a man
[26544.27s -> 26546.27s]  mmm, I could go back here, but I
[26546.95s -> 26559.24s]  Don't see any reason to go back yet. I think I'm dead
[26564.30s -> 26569.34s]  Whoo-hoo. I misplayed that that was actually really good by Lulu cooldowns. No, you're fine, man
[26569.34s -> 26574.66s]  I wish I could I wish I could tell him that he played it fine. I messed up. Not him. I messed up. Ah
[26576.56s -> 26579.08s]  I feel bad. I want to like say no, you're fine
[26579.08s -> 26585.01s]  Because that was my bad I
[26585.77s -> 26586.63s]  Should have okay
[26586.63s -> 26591.09s]  So when I flashed and I was running away from the twitch right the second that twitch flashed on me
[26591.09s -> 26593.09s]  I should have instantly started autoing him
[26593.27s -> 26598.55s]  Like I and it was one extra auto like one single extra auto and it would have been fine
[26601.86s -> 26603.48s]  Why can't I tell her?
[26603.48s -> 26607.94s]  You know, I just choose not to type anymore
[26608.78s -> 26612.80s]  It's my choice
[26612.80s -> 26620.61s]  You know, yeah my choice
[26639.66s -> 26641.66s]  Guys actually doing that, huh?
[26641.66s -> 26649.55s]  We win 2v2 really fucking hard especially with tier 2 boots, but I need a
[26664.76s -> 26668.20s]  Dude, I'm doing some scripty shit. I don't be real
[26673.84s -> 26678.88s]  Dude Lulu wasn't six. I thought she was six. I'm so bad. I
[26681.78s -> 26683.78s]  Wish I could tell her my bad again
[26683.78s -> 26685.78s]  I'm actually trolling
[26686.18s -> 26689.90s]  like I ran out of mana because I'm bad and then I
[26690.82s -> 26695.16s]  and then I thought she was six
[26695.16s -> 26698.22s]  So I walked up to like take tank the turret for a second, right?
[26698.34s -> 26700.90s]  Cuz I was like, oh shit, maybe I'll get like maybe we can kill this guy
[26700.90s -> 26704.52s]  Maybe Lulu has a spell or something. I just oh I played bad my bad
[26710.50s -> 26721.49s]  W that make sure Akro's not there. I feel I actually just feel so bad because the Lulu is actually playing really
[26721.49s -> 26723.49s]  It's like the best support I've had all day
[26723.49s -> 26725.49s]  Like this guy's actually impressing me, right?
[26725.89s -> 26727.89s]  Like this guy's playing really well
[26727.97s -> 26760.56s]  And I'm just griefing
[26760.56s -> 26765.60s]  Lulu gave her life for me
[26765.60s -> 26772.34s]  Lulu gave her life for me boys. Can we get a a salute for Lulu and chat boys?
[26773.40s -> 26778.18s]  Do we get a salute? Can we get some love for Lulu?
[26779.88s -> 26806.85s]  She gave her life for the homie honestly, that was a really cool to be too by the way
[26808.53s -> 26810.53s]  Whole night was smurfing it. What the fuck?
[26811.27s -> 26813.27s]  You'll kill that bitch, too
[26829.35s -> 26840.09s]  nice
[26840.09s -> 26842.09s]  No, oh
[26843.03s -> 26845.03s]  If I lost that cannon I would have lost my life
[26846.03s -> 26876.49s]  in game
[26876.49s -> 26879.13s]  I'm gonna go BT second item. We have Lulu
[26879.77s -> 26881.77s]  So wait, what the fuck is this pathing?
[26883.25s -> 26886.31s]  I clicked to go bot and it pats me in the weirdest spot ever. We have Lulu
[26886.41s -> 26891.45s]  So I could actually go IE second, but I think if I go BT, I'll be actually unkillable
[26892.69s -> 26894.89s]  Like it'll be the greatest thing ever.
[26894.89s -> 26901.78s]  I actually still might go IE as I'm thinking about it out loud by saying we have Lulu and not be stupid
[26901.78s -> 26905.44s]  But hey, I guess don't might you know, I still might go IE
[26905.44s -> 26909.14s]  But I don't know yet and we'll see cuz I took a lacquer D. So it's like
[26910.32s -> 26925.13s]  Wow
[26925.13s -> 26949.18s]  No, I'm gonna die. I
[26949.22s -> 26951.22s]  Mean, I don't know why I flashed away
[26952.94s -> 26955.88s]  I'm playing bad. It's my fault. I
[26957.22s -> 26961.62s]  Think the game's over. So I'm just I'm playing bad. I'm like limit testing a little bit too much
[26961.76s -> 27056.41s]  it today.
[27056.41s -> 27057.41s]  And then.
[27057.41s -> 27058.41s]  Dude.
[27058.41s -> 27060.81s]  How does this game.
[27060.81s -> 27062.21s]  Oh, I'm even more mad.
[27062.21s -> 27064.59s]  You guys have no idea.
[27064.59s -> 27067.21s]  So I.
[27067.21s -> 27073.87s]  24 to 8 the enemy team doesn't forfeit but my team forfeits when the score is 10 to 14
[27074.77s -> 27077.73s]  And we're only down a thousand golds
[27095.43s -> 27097.07s]  Sorry, I was
[27097.07s -> 27099.07s]  That was my bad. I was tilted by
[27099.87s -> 27105.44s]  You know, I was thinking about about how they weren't forfeiting and I was getting mad
[27106.98s -> 27109.62s]  It is a little interesting cuz I said they still can't win
[27110.10s -> 27114.44s]  So I don't know who the fuck setting no, but it's probably echo. Well, no, I goes definitely heading though
[27114.44s -> 27116.44s]  But like who else?
[27116.92s -> 27121.21s]  Maybe brand
[27121.21s -> 27123.49s]  Maybe ribbon. Hey ribbons like yeah
[27124.09s -> 27133.66s]  They just get a thousand gold. All right, I should probably stop trolling
[27134.18s -> 27141.64s]  I'd feel pretty silly if we lost cuz I'm bad after we like dumpstered him in lane that art
[27141.64s -> 27144.16s]  I feel pretty silly if we lost cuz I keep getting caught
[27144.68s -> 27163.54s]  All right, I should be unkillable now
[27163.70s -> 27168.12s]  Like I'm not even farming. I'm actually griefing. I
[27168.80s -> 27172.92s]  Should probably go make dinner after this game. I want to keep playing cuz I'm playing well today
[27172.92s -> 27177.52s]  But like dude, my brain is starting to go like like I probably need to go make some food
[27178.14s -> 27196.15s]  I'm getting the full ADHD brain experience going. So let's see if I can muster all my focus
[27196.75s -> 27203.49s]  Let's see if I can muster up all my focus really quick just for
[27204.21s -> 27209.65s]  Push out and finish this game
[27209.65s -> 27215.13s]  We'll go Terminator mode for the the end of this game right now. We'll muster up all of the all of the focus
[27224.15s -> 27227.21s]  Demon mode engaged boys. God that sounded really cringe
[27227.85s -> 27283.46s]  I'm actually really impressed though. Nightblue played this game really really well. Like I'll be honest
[27284.00s -> 27287.84s]  My last like thought of Nightblue was him being bad at League
[27289.26s -> 27291.58s]  He played this game really well
[27292.24s -> 27296.83s]  My man's gotten so much better
[27302.92s -> 27308.52s]  Okay, nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that
[27308.84s -> 27313.68s]  Nobody saw that nobody saw that not one of you saw me flash after the echo ulted not one of you
[27313.68s -> 27324.56s]  Wasted flash? No, that was assertive flash.
[27324.56s -> 27327.56s]  An assertive dominant flash.
[27327.56s -> 27329.56s]  Not wasted at all.
[27329.56s -> 27336.96s]  They might actually go for Baron here.
[27336.96s -> 27339.96s]  We should look for this.
[27339.96s -> 27342.96s]  Like they could try. Oh, he's here.
[27342.96s -> 27352.40s]  Pretty sure the Riven's here too though.
[27352.40s -> 27355.40s]  Yep. I did not mean to do that.
[27355.40s -> 27359.40s]  I didn't mean to hit the thing. I accidentally hit the blast plants.
[27359.40s -> 27363.56s]  That was that was an accident it was a it was a literal pure accidents
[27366.33s -> 27368.25s]  like I I
[27368.25s -> 27371.49s]  Did not mean to hit it. I was like I know ribbons here
[27371.49s -> 27376.85s]  I'm gonna wait for Yasuo before I go over or before I do this right and I'm gonna bait him and I just completely
[27377.09s -> 27382.97s]  Whiffed every like I'm bad. We'll leave it at I'm bad. That's a good way to put I'm bad. I'm hungry
[27382.97s -> 27385.71s]  I'm old I'm bald. I'm bad. Nothing else to say
[27386.89s -> 27388.89s]  short to short mad
[27402.55s -> 27405.15s]  Yeah, that was a pedestrian flash
[27406.39s -> 27411.87s]  It is she as well. Oh, yeah, it's it's a plethora a plethora of terrible things
[27411.87s -> 27418.08s]  I still got to go to the gym tonight, too
[27442.81s -> 27444.41s]  said spot
[27444.41s -> 27445.77s]  Okay
[27445.77s -> 27447.97s]  I'm a little nervous of like getting flanked
[27449.13s -> 27451.17s]  Right there junglers could just like sit in places
[27468.80s -> 27470.80s]  Nice. We got topping him. Not bad
[27471.56s -> 27473.56s]  Yeah, I mean we just try and get mid and hip here
[27473.56s -> 27500.58s]  Oh, let's go help our homie though like I'm actually so sad I'm playing so bad
[27501.90s -> 27506.62s]  Like I was playing so good at the start and now I'm playing so bad. It actually makes me sad. I
[27516.05s -> 27518.05s]  was tanking for that guy I
[27529.28s -> 27538.75s]  Was just leave I
[27538.75s -> 27544.55s]  Don't wanna I don't want to throw the game for my my teammates cuz like I'm getting like, you know
[27546.99s -> 27575.44s]  I've already died five times like a dipshit. Oh, where'd he go?
[27575.84s -> 27583.44s]  We should just push bot honestly
[27584.68s -> 27595.96s]  We don't even need this dragon
[27595.96s -> 27597.96s]  Okay, we just I'm just gonna put spot
[27643.96s -> 27658.66s]  Not bad
[27658.66s -> 27663.32s]  Not bad at all. I gotta give it. I want to give it to night blue, but I gotta give it to this Lulu
[27664.34s -> 27671.31s]  Lulu played that game so good. I gotta give it to Lulu. She played so fucking good
[27676.06s -> 27693.61s]  Like actually, I don't even know if she's still in here
[27712.60s -> 27721.93s]  I'm not a scripter
[27721.93s -> 27734.23s]  She thinks I'm a no, I'm serious. She thinks I'm a scripter
[27739.18s -> 27758.68s]  Bro, I'm streaming
[27758.84s -> 27760.98s]  Dude, the homie thought I'm a scripter
[27761.74s -> 27766.66s]  You know, I'll take it my ego feels good
[27776.05s -> 27778.05s]  Honestly, that feels good. That feels good
[27778.53s -> 27783.86s]  Hi, well
[27783.86s -> 27785.86s]  That was a scripted dude. I'm not gonna lie though
[27786.22s -> 27789.38s]  Some of those movements were sus as fuck that I was making
[27789.90s -> 27794.28s]  Like I was I like I like turned on the fucking mental scripts for that game
[27794.28s -> 27803.04s]  some of those movements early were nuts like like just like this tiny little tiny
[27803.04s -> 27807.24s]  little movements I was doing early game in lane were crazy like look at this
[27807.24s -> 27817.05s]  watch this like this movement right here right like look I dodged that right
[27817.05s -> 27829.14s]  then I walk up cleanse the thing kite down like that that movement is gross
[27829.14s -> 27836.40s]  man look that was actually some gross ass movement I'm not gonna lie look
[27836.40s -> 27849.88s]  this in the corner man in the corner my brain was like you know Andromeda thank
[27849.88s -> 27854.56s]  you man yo you played really good now I felt bad I felt so bad because I was
[27854.56s -> 27859.60s]  griefing like I was like at the start of the game we were just snow like I
[27859.60s -> 27864.12s]  literally fucked up like three times during like the really important fights
[27864.12s -> 27865.72s]  And I was like, oh no
[27865.72s -> 27873.64s]  Yeah, thank you for the bits. Can I play Kalista? Uh, I can
[27874.24s -> 27882.01s]  I'm trying to figure out if I want to play a Kalista game or if I want to go make dinner
[27888.77s -> 27895.01s]  There was one other movement that I thought was kind of nuts. I did a really good movement to somewhere. I don't remember what it was
[27898.30s -> 27901.10s]  Here's where I fucked up. So right now I
[27901.62s -> 27907.06s]  Should have just been I for some reason my brain lagged and I should have just been sitting here. Um, I
[27907.78s -> 27910.32s]  Should have just cleansed and then started fighting the twitch
[27911.12s -> 27914.62s]  For some reason I didn't cleanse but this wasn't like your fault at all
[27914.62s -> 27919.98s]  Like I the second the twitch flashed I should have insta cleansed the ignite and I should have been killing him
[27920.40s -> 27923.30s]  Like right now just like autoing because I can't get away from him, right?
[27923.46s -> 27926.64s]  But it took me an extra second. See how I I started fighting him now
[27927.28s -> 27936.13s]  Like I barely died. I wouldn't have died had I cleansed and had I just turned initially it was fine
[27936.97s -> 27946.00s]  And then like here I fucked up too because I went in and I thought we were six
[27946.00s -> 27955.94s]  Oh, I could have killed that guy. I
[27957.04s -> 27960.76s]  Should have gone forward one more. Oh, you know what? I should have done there
[27960.76s -> 27965.80s]  I should have gone forward one more auto killed this guy Lulu would have gotten six off of the kill
[27965.80s -> 27970.48s]  I would have used my speed to come back out then she could have ulted me we could have killed the
[27971.52s -> 27974.52s]  We could have got the twitch and then we could have turned on this echo, too. Oh
[27981.80s -> 27984.30s]  This was a really cool to be too. I
[27985.50s -> 27987.50s]  Actually thought this TV 2 is really sick
[27987.50s -> 27998.47s]  Lulu's a real one for this man. Listen, you're a real one for this one. You just took the
[27998.47s -> 28020.31s]  death to save me. Respect. You're a real one for that. That was so good. Jesus was fun.
[28020.31s -> 28024.39s]  Yeah, jeez. You were the best support I've had today. Like legitimately you played
[28024.39s -> 28028.07s]  better than all the other players in the Seela. That was really good. Like I was
[28028.07s -> 28032.47s]  surprised. I was telling my stream I was like, yeah, she's actually like, they,
[28032.47s -> 28035.11s]  I said she because you're a little I don't know, you know, but I was like, yeah
[28035.99s -> 28039.47s]  She's playing super good. She's playing way better than all of my fucking teammates
[28044.36s -> 28046.08s]  Yo
[28046.08s -> 28048.08s]  What time is it? It's six
[28048.40s -> 28052.68s]  Man, do I want to do I want to keep streaming or do I want to go to or do I want to go get food?
[28052.68s -> 28059.10s]  And go to the gym. I can't like 24 hour fitness is not actually 24 anymore
[28059.38s -> 28067.98s]  So I'd have to go soon if I'm gonna go to the gym, but it is only like six
[28067.98s -> 28088.68s]  I could just end on hitting the 400 LP mark and just chill for now.
[28088.68s -> 28091.89s]  Right?
[28091.89s -> 28096.13s]  Like we hit 400 LP, we'll probably hit GM tomorrow.
[28096.13s -> 28101.53s]  So I could just chill for now and then we can just hit GM tomorrow.
[28101.53s -> 28104.97s]  That's probably a better idea because then I won't get mad.
[28104.97s -> 28109.83s]  Like say we get another game like this, right?
[28109.83s -> 28115.59s]  Say we get another game like this where like we're literally winning the game and my team's like no, let's forfeit like that's gonna
[28115.59s -> 28118.19s]  Make me mad. I was mad. This is gonna make me mad, right? Like I
[28118.79s -> 28130.38s]  So I'd rather just like get off on a good note like a happy note, you know, like not be tilted GM tomorrow
[28130.38s -> 28135.38s]  Yeah, I hope so. I've been I think I can get challenger back this year, but we got to get to GM first
[28135.98s -> 28140.82s]  I'm telling you I this elo is so miserable like master tier is
[28140.82s -> 28148.14s]  is the worst Elo I've ever played in in my 12 years of playing this game
[28149.38s -> 28153.26s]  whatever NA 300 400 LP Masters is is
[28154.38s -> 28156.38s]  literally disgusting
[28156.38s -> 28163.10s]  These are not real people like I feel like half these games we are playing with NPCs
[28164.66s -> 28169.86s]  Who quite literally don't even like I don't even know what to say other bots and
[28169.86s -> 28175.32s]  And they can't be real humans. They get mad over nothing. They rage quit over nothing
[28175.32s -> 28178.46s]  They they they give up at 15 minutes when we're winning the game
[28178.98s -> 28187.17s]  These cannot be real people. So I swear to God the game has to get better in GM
[28187.17s -> 28191.67s]  It has to get better. There's no world that it gets worse
[28192.87s -> 28194.87s]  Like I refuse to believe that
[28195.77s -> 28203.74s]  Because this is this is the worst grind I've ever had. Is it bad to be a bot?
[28203.74s -> 28207.89s]  Are you saying I'm botist?
[28207.89s -> 28213.46s]  Are you gonna cancel me because I don't like bots?
[28213.46s -> 28215.46s]  I said it. I'm saying it. I don't like fucking bots.
[28215.46s -> 28218.46s]  Well, okay, I didn't need to add. Fuck.
[28218.46s -> 28220.46s]  You know what? I'm gonna get off.
[28220.46s -> 28222.46s]  Yeah, that's it. That's it for me.
[28222.46s -> 28225.46s]  I'm gonna get off, boys. I'm tired.
[28225.46s -> 28227.46s]  I need to go to the gym before I run out of juice.
[28227.46s -> 28229.46s]  Make some dinner.
[28229.46s -> 28231.46s]  I will be live tomorrow, same time as today.
[28231.46s -> 28233.46s]  I've been starting my stream at 10 a.m.
[28233.46s -> 28235.46s]  My time.
[28235.46s -> 28240.92s]  Maybe I'll do it tomorrow at 9 a.m. I don't know. It's 10 or 9 between there
[28240.92s -> 28247.04s]  I always start my stream and so uh, and that's my time. So it's like seven eight nine PST
[28247.82s -> 28251.62s]  You're good at ad. Thanks, man. I think I suck. My goal is
[28252.62s -> 28254.62s]  hopefully I can get challenger back and
[28255.18s -> 28260.98s]  Then I'm not gonna play like I just want to my goal is challenger so that I can prove to myself
[28260.98s -> 28266.82s]  It's a really stupid thing, but I want to prove to myself that I can still do it at 32
[28266.82s -> 28270.74s]  because 10 years ago was the first time I started streaming this year. I've been
[28270.74s -> 28275.70s]  streaming for 10 years this year and so I want to get Challenger because when I
[28275.70s -> 28278.26s]  first started streaming I was in Challenger and I want to see if like
[28278.26s -> 28284.86s]  after 10 years I can still do it and then I'm never gonna care again. This
[28284.86s -> 28287.98s]  will be the only time I ever give a shit about getting Challenger. I just
[28287.98s -> 28294.06s]  to get it see if i care and then play for content you know but uh yeah it's just it's just like
[28294.06s -> 28300.78s]  welcome to the league of draven see if the old man who has fucking arthritis and
[28301.66s -> 28305.10s]  fucking carpal tunnel and all that shit you know what i mean see if i can still do it
[28307.02s -> 28309.82s]  yo thank you for the twitch prime man i appreciate it thank you so much
[28310.38s -> 28313.98s]  appreciate it a lot dude all right guys that's gonna be it for me if you like the stream
[28313.98s -> 28317.26s]  don't forget to follow all my socials and tiktok and facebook and instagram and all
[28317.26s -> 28320.10s]  all that shit's all the collectible garbage is underneath the stream don't
[28320.10s -> 28325.42s]  forget to check it out I'll be back tomorrow same time in the morning I
[28325.42s -> 28329.02s]  tomorrow's my last day for the weekend though I'm not gonna stream on Saturday
[28329.02s -> 28333.46s]  I might do some off-stream grinding on Saturday I've been taking I've been
[28333.46s -> 28337.30s]  like forcing myself to take a day off of streaming every week just so like I
[28337.30s -> 28341.14s]  can mentally recharge and I think it's actually been really good for my
[28341.14s -> 28344.34s]  stream because like I've been in a much better mood while streaming and
[28344.34s -> 28348.54s]  I've been much less tilted and I've been even if I play league off stream or whatever
[28348.54s -> 28352.34s]  It's just like it doesn't feel as forced. So I feel like the breaks nice
[28352.34s -> 28357.50s]  So yeah tomorrow no stream on Saturday tomorrow for sure and Sunday. I might I might do a short stream
[28358.00s -> 28361.46s]  But yeah, I'll see you guys then. Thanks for watching. I appreciate you guys and
[28363.78s -> 28370.72s]  Yeah, that's it. I'm gonna go make dinner. Oh, we guys have a good night day wherever the fuck you are
[28371.34s -> 28376.62s]  Later dudes. Hope you guys have a good one. It was fun playing with you Andromeda. Good luck on the games
[28377.66s -> 28379.66s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow. Peace!
