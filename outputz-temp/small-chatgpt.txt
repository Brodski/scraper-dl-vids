[0.00s -> 5.36s]  We want to take a moment to pay tribute to Barbara Walter. She was a trail-blazing journalist
[5.36s -> 10.16s]  who spent more than half a century in broadcast news. Throughout her iconic career, Barbara
[10.16s -> 15.20s]  Walter shattered glass ceiling after glass ceiling, breaking barriers in an industry once dominated
[15.20s -> 20.08s]  by men, and paving the way for today's female journalist. She was the first-ever woman
[20.08s -> 25.92s]  to co-host NBC's Today Show, and later the first woman to anchor a network evening news
[25.92s -> 29.60s]  broadcast. In a tweet on Saturday, President Biden said quote,
[29.60s -> 33.36s]  Barbara Walters has always been an example of bravery and truth
[33.36s -> 38.24s]  breaking barriers while driving our nation forward. Her legacy will continue
[38.24s -> 42.88s]  as an inspiration for all journalists. Barbara Walters conducted hundreds of
[42.88s -> 46.40s]  interviews with newsmakers from the world of politics, sports and
[46.40s -> 50.32s]  entertainment. She was famous for asking tough questions and sometimes
[50.32s -> 53.60s]  uncomfortable questions and forgetting some of the world's most famous
[53.60s -> 58.24s]  people to reveal parts of themselves the public had not seen before. Here she was
[58.24s -> 64.96s]  on Meet the Press back in February 1976, pressing then the Prime Minister of Israel.
[64.96s -> 69.04s]  We'll have the first questions now from Barbara Walters of NBC News.
[69.04s -> 73.84s]  Mr. Prime Minister, you have repeatedly said in your speeches that a militarily strong
[73.84s -> 78.48s]  Israel is necessary to maintain the peace. Now the Pentagon and the CIA have reported
[78.48s -> 82.80s]  after their military analysis that Israel is more than strong enough to deter any
[82.80s -> 87.62s]  our progression. Were you able to convince Congress and President Ford, those who are
[87.62s -> 92.78s]  responsible for deciding military aid to Israel, that you are right and that the CIA and the
[92.78s -> 94.18s]  Pentagon are wrong?
[94.18s -> 100.62s]  Well, first I would like to thank the CIA and the Pentagon for complimenting Israel for
[100.62s -> 108.54s]  its military strengths. But I believe that we need more than compliments. We need hardware.
[108.54s -> 112.42s]  Mr. Prime Minister, we've heard these arguments now back and forth for a year. And I'd
[112.42s -> 116.92s]  I'd like to get back to my very first question, which was how do you expect to have a Geneva
[116.92s -> 119.10s]  conference reconvened without the PLO?
[119.10s -> 122.90s]  Can you give us any sign, any hope, any direction?
[122.90s -> 128.74s]  Can you realistically be specific about one new action that's going to break the stalemate,
[128.74s -> 132.18s]  the same conversation back and forth that we have heard from the year?
[132.18s -> 135.42s]  Has anything happened in this week or are things basically the way they were before you
[135.42s -> 136.42s]  came to this country?
[136.42s -> 141.58s]  I believe that there are basically two options how to move towards peace
[144.52s -> 150.74s]  Incredible to watch her do her work Barbara Walters died on Friday in New York City. She was 93 years old
[154.55s -> 161.39s]  Thanks for watching our YouTube channel follow today's top stories and breaking news by downloading the NBC News app
