[0.00s -> 3.20s]  We want to take a moment to pay tribute to Barbara Walters.
[3.20s -> 8.32s]  She was a trailblazing journalist who spent more than half a century in broadcast news
[8.32s -> 13.04s]  throughout her iconic career, Barbara Walters shattered glass ceiling after glass ceiling,
[13.04s -> 18.40s]  breaking bears in an industry once dominated by men, and paving the way for today's female journalists.
[18.40s -> 24.24s]  She was the first ever woman to co-host NBC's today show and later the first woman to anchor
[24.24s -> 28.08s]  and network evening news broadcast in a tweet on Saturday,
[28.08s -> 29.68s]  President Biden said, quote,
[29.68s -> 32.72s]  Barbara Walters has always been an example of bravery
[32.72s -> 36.64s]  and truth-breaking barriers while driving our nation forward.
[36.64s -> 40.48s]  Her legacy will continue as an inspiration for all journalists.
[40.48s -> 43.60s]  Barbara Walters conducted hundreds of interviews
[43.60s -> 47.28s]  with newsmakers from the world of politics, sports, and entertainment.
[47.28s -> 49.60s]  She was famous for asking tough questions,
[49.60s -> 51.36s]  and sometimes uncomfortable questions,
[51.36s -> 55.80s]  and forgetting some of the world's most famous people to reveal parts of themselves the
[55.80s -> 57.86s]  public had not seen before.
[57.86s -> 63.74s]  Here she was on Meet the Press back in February 1976, pressing then the Prime Minister
[63.74s -> 64.74s]  of Israel.
[64.74s -> 68.86s]  We'll have the first questions now from Barbara Walters of NBC News.
[68.86s -> 73.90s]  Mr. Prime Minister, you have repeatedly said in your speeches that a militarily strong
[73.90s -> 76.62s]  Israel is necessary to maintain the peace.
[76.62s -> 81.06s]  Now the Pentagon and the CIA have reported after their military analysis that Israel is
[81.06s -> 84.38s]  more than strong enough to deter any Arab aggression.
[84.38s -> 88.90s]  Were you able to convince Congress and President Ford, those who are responsible for deciding
[88.90s -> 94.22s]  military aid to Israel, that you are right, and that the CIA and the Pentagon are wrong?
[94.22s -> 100.26s]  Well, first I would like to thank the CIA and the Pentagon for complimenting, as well
[100.26s -> 102.94s]  for its military strengths.
[102.94s -> 106.98s]  But I believe that we need more than compliments.
[106.98s -> 108.98s]  We need hardware.
[108.98s -> 112.46s]  The Prime Minister, we've heard these arguments now back and forth for a year, and I'd
[112.46s -> 117.02s]  like to get back to my very first question, which was, how do you expect to have a Geneva
[117.02s -> 119.02s]  conference we convene without the PLO?
[119.02s -> 122.90s]  Can you give us any time, any hope, any direction?
[122.90s -> 128.74s]  Can you realistically be specific about one new action that's going to break the stalemate,
[128.74s -> 133.02s]  the same conversation back and forth, the way it was for the year, has anything happened
[133.02s -> 136.74s]  in this week or things basically the way they were before you came to this country?
[136.74s -> 140.26s]  I believe that they are basically two options
[140.26s -> 144.40s]  how to move to a space.
[144.40s -> 146.40s]  Incredible to watch her do her work.
[146.40s -> 149.36s]  Barbara Walters died on Friday in New York City.
[149.36s -> 154.77s]  She was 93 years old.
[154.77s -> 156.77s]  Thanks for watching our YouTube channel.
[156.77s -> 161.97s]  Follow today's top stories and breaking news by downloading the NBC News app.
