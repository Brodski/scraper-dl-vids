[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  I
[00:30.000 --> 00:50.000]  I
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  I
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  I
[02:20.000 --> 02:22.000]  I
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  I
[03:10.200 --> 03:12.200]  That guy has
[03:14.880 --> 03:16.880]  Weville to GP
[03:20.680 --> 03:22.680]  I
[03:26.880 --> 03:28.880]  What a piece
[03:35.520 --> 03:37.520]  Jesus
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  Oh
[04:14.080 --> 04:16.080]  Yo, I was a man
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  I
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  Sub dudes
[04:50.120 --> 04:52.120]  Yeah
[04:52.120 --> 05:20.760]  Yeah, I mean we're hoping
[05:22.120 --> 05:31.560]  We'll see man, we'll see fingers fucking crossed right
[05:52.120 --> 05:54.120]  I
[06:22.120 --> 06:31.440]  Do I ever actually
[06:45.360 --> 06:48.160]  I'm wondering if I I'm assuming I'm just playing I'm F
[06:52.120 --> 06:54.120]  I
[07:22.120 --> 07:24.120]  I
[07:41.280 --> 07:43.280]  No way
[07:53.040 --> 07:57.640]  Yeah, this is probably just me doing fucking
[08:02.360 --> 08:04.360]  I'm probably just doing star guardian
[08:04.360 --> 08:06.360]  I
[08:18.560 --> 08:20.560]  Welcome to the
[08:21.200 --> 08:25.000]  27 months man, I appreciate the lot dude. Thank you
[08:34.360 --> 08:36.360]  And
[08:46.840 --> 08:50.640]  I could probably still go in finiteam, but so I'm holding the solution
[08:51.720 --> 08:53.720]  But I haven't seen any severs or anything
[08:54.760 --> 08:56.760]  So it'd be kind of awkward, you know
[09:04.360 --> 09:06.360]  I
[09:34.360 --> 09:36.360]  I
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  I
[10:07.400 --> 10:09.400]  This guy's definitely gonna beat me
[10:18.920 --> 10:20.920]  That guys I
[10:21.040 --> 10:25.200]  See why he hasn't lost that's his five infinity team already Jesus Christ. I
[10:26.280 --> 10:28.960]  Was like man, why is that guy so strong and then I like realized
[10:34.360 --> 10:36.360]  I
[11:04.360 --> 11:06.360]  I
[11:34.360 --> 11:36.360]  I
[12:04.360 --> 12:06.360]  I
[12:30.080 --> 12:32.080]  Go to seven next rounds
[12:34.360 --> 12:36.360]  I
[12:58.520 --> 13:02.920]  Then hopefully we can head some shit
[13:04.360 --> 13:06.360]  I
[13:23.800 --> 13:26.400]  Kind of like this actually because now we can make I
[13:27.640 --> 13:31.260]  Can actually make a guard breaker and I could also make
[13:34.960 --> 13:36.960]  We going guard breaker and mess
[13:36.960 --> 13:38.960]  I
[14:01.760 --> 14:05.720]  Kind of want to just Ionic spark, but I don't know if I should
[14:07.960 --> 14:09.960]  I need
[14:10.480 --> 14:13.640]  An echo a Niko or a round
[14:14.720 --> 14:17.360]  That's what could use an Ezreal. I need like a quick draw. I
[14:18.960 --> 14:20.960]  Should have kept that Lucian from earlier
[14:20.960 --> 14:22.960]  I
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.760]  Just because of level three blitzcrank and he's just so fucking strong it's stupid
[14:50.960 --> 14:52.960]  I
[15:21.360 --> 15:23.360]  I
[15:23.360 --> 15:25.360]  I
[15:48.960 --> 15:50.960]  This is really interesting
[15:54.360 --> 15:57.720]  I guess I could go spell singer as well
[16:14.920 --> 16:17.720]  And we just give the shift to TF
[16:24.360 --> 16:26.360]  I
[16:46.160 --> 16:48.160]  Resu this for now, too
[16:53.360 --> 16:55.360]  I
[17:15.400 --> 17:21.800]  Guess I could use I could do jewel gauntlet
[17:23.640 --> 17:25.640]  I don't know
[17:26.960 --> 17:29.480]  Could jewel gauntlet this shit up so goes
[17:53.360 --> 17:55.360]  I
[18:23.440 --> 18:28.120]  Need to like throw an item down, but I feel like morella is bad
[18:30.480 --> 18:32.480]  I guess I could just use hat
[18:37.320 --> 18:39.860]  Or like I said before jewel gauntlet could be good
[18:47.600 --> 18:49.600]  I don't know
[18:53.360 --> 18:55.360]  I
[19:04.960 --> 19:08.000]  Could just roll on seven to train three star stuff
[19:12.320 --> 19:15.800]  This guy has three kaisa's though this guy has one kaisa
[19:19.320 --> 19:21.840]  Kind of hard to three star kaisa I could three star Niva
[19:23.360 --> 19:25.360]  I
[19:25.360 --> 19:27.360]  I
[19:50.400 --> 19:53.100]  Guess I'll eat with fucking 20 gold

[21:55.360 --> 21:57.360]  I

[22:57.360 --> 22:59.360]  I
[23:19.000 --> 23:24.520]  Wish I could get some thick front line leveled up that'd be cool
[23:27.360 --> 23:29.360]  I
[23:57.360 --> 23:59.360]  I

[25:27.800 --> 25:29.800]  I
[25:41.920 --> 25:48.800]  Well rep I was gonna go MF and then I like decided to go Niko and I just fucked it all up. Oh well. Oh
[25:51.240 --> 25:53.240]  Wow
[25:57.360 --> 25:59.360]  You
[26:11.240 --> 26:13.240]  Time is a 10
[26:27.360 --> 26:29.360]  You
[26:58.360 --> 27:01.640]  What's up boys, how's everybody doing?
[27:14.240 --> 27:16.240]  Oh, I'll be right back
[27:16.240 --> 27:18.240]  You
[27:23.080 --> 27:27.440]  So I'm still waking up with me give me one sec subscribe oh
[27:46.240 --> 27:48.240]  Oh
[27:55.200 --> 27:57.200]  Okay, oh
[27:59.720 --> 28:02.840]  Yeah, baby I was gonna play on my man at the start but dude
[28:02.840 --> 28:07.280]  I don't know if I can sit through fucking eight minute queue times to get people raging at each other all day
[28:07.600 --> 28:10.320]  So we'll we'll do some warm-up on this account for a bit
[28:16.240 --> 28:18.240]  I
[28:22.320 --> 28:25.920]  What am Mars's count like D1 low master
[28:33.160 --> 28:39.640]  Like my other counts like 500 this one's I want to say like I don't know the MMR is really awkward
[28:40.520 --> 28:43.320]  When you get like well masters right like the MMR super awkward
[28:43.600 --> 28:49.680]  So I don't know what are they amores, but I know it's low masters. So like sometimes there's diamonds sometimes there's like hundred LP players
[28:51.160 --> 28:53.160]  Somewhere between there
[28:57.120 --> 28:59.120]  Dude I
[29:01.560 --> 29:09.260]  I played some games off stream yesterday, I got up to like 400 LP then I lost three in a row that shit was painful
[29:13.320 --> 29:15.320]  I
[29:15.600 --> 29:19.160]  Did into one of tenacity's games though, so that was fun
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  That felt bad
[29:29.960 --> 29:36.960]  No, yeah, straight up it felt so bad he was doing so good too like I straight up just had a bad game and I felt I felt like shit
[29:39.360 --> 29:42.080]  Look at this shit I just dropped like eight deaths. Look at the shits
[29:43.920 --> 29:47.920]  Like he was just straight up smurfing on the enemy top laner
[29:48.640 --> 29:53.200]  And we all the entire team just like decided to collectively run it down
[29:55.080 --> 29:57.080]  Like we all just got shit on
[30:02.000 --> 30:05.040]  This was a really weird game because I feel like
[30:05.800 --> 30:13.360]  That game was like the first game I felt everybody in the game was like actually high GM challenger
[30:13.360 --> 30:17.320]  But they weren't rated that there's a very weird system going on
[30:22.560 --> 30:24.560]  Let's do a Cassiopeia game
[30:29.880 --> 30:31.880]  Like I'll show you guys what I mean in a second
[30:36.040 --> 30:38.960]  I'm assuming I should go this right
[30:44.440 --> 30:48.960]  This is probably good or this that's probably good too
[30:54.840 --> 30:57.480]  Oh well, okay, so yeah, we'll get this stuff
[30:58.480 --> 31:05.400]  Like neon Tonso is like he's been challenger for a long time, right? I don't even know who the fuck this guy was
[31:07.240 --> 31:10.460]  Some random Senna player who's like not playing Senna now
[31:13.360 --> 31:16.080]  And then this guy was like trying to jungle and just like running it down
[31:17.640 --> 31:21.120]  It was I don't even know it was the weirdest game that I've played in a while
[31:21.640 --> 31:25.560]  Because like my ad carry wasn't bad
[31:26.360 --> 31:30.600]  Like this guy's clearly like on a Smurf, but I don't know how good he was because he wasn't bad at the game
[31:32.120 --> 31:34.120]  The enemy ad carry wasn't bad
[31:35.080 --> 31:40.520]  This guy's also on a Smurf. It was the weirdest lobby. It was like a bunch of Smurf accounts
[31:41.040 --> 31:44.400]  All playing with each other, but it was like a non Smurf queue
[31:48.080 --> 31:50.080]  This guy was like the only non Smurf
[31:52.040 --> 31:54.040]  It was interesting
[32:02.920 --> 32:10.760]  Do I take ghost here or do I just I thought ghosts could be really OP versus their team with Cassiopeia, but maybe I should just take
[32:10.760 --> 32:12.760]  I
[32:18.320 --> 32:21.320]  I'm gonna try it. Oh somebody dodged
[32:23.200 --> 32:26.640]  Because yeah, I don't know I never know I never know if I should take ghost ignite whatever
[32:28.480 --> 32:34.640]  Because I feel like ghost with Cassios feels like the same thing's ad carry right same idea where it feels really OP
[32:41.000 --> 32:48.500]  Dude there's so much drama going on in the league community yet again by the way, it's
[32:53.800 --> 32:55.800]  It's insane
[33:11.000 --> 33:18.600]  Yeah, I don't know man, I I just I'm
[33:25.000 --> 33:32.160]  Like I like looking at drama because like drama is juicy like I like looking at drama, but it's also like
[33:35.120 --> 33:37.120]  How are people so stupid
[33:40.760 --> 33:42.760]  I
[33:53.600 --> 33:59.680]  Yeah, I'm getting like I I don't know man my view on all of this shit is like I
[34:01.880 --> 34:03.880]  Guess I'm just not hardwired that way
[34:03.880 --> 34:09.360]  I can't mentally wrap my head around being like excited the fort with underage girls
[34:09.960 --> 34:11.960]  Or like when like I
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.440]  Just I never like had the want
[34:20.920 --> 34:23.000]  Like it happens so much
[34:25.040 --> 34:30.040]  Between like League streamers and non like just it's not even a league thing. It's just that we're in the league community, right? So you see it more
[34:30.760 --> 34:32.280]  dude like
[34:32.280 --> 34:34.560]  well, the drama is like a
[34:35.520 --> 34:41.880]  Decent-sized league streamer who is like getting bigger or whatever like the ad carry streamer cookie roll or whatever he was like
[34:42.440 --> 34:44.440]  somebody made a 90 page
[34:46.040 --> 34:48.040]  90 pages of
[34:48.440 --> 34:50.440]  Google Doc
[34:51.840 --> 34:54.400]  To basically like expose this guy for like
[34:55.160 --> 34:57.480]  Talking a bunch like sexually to underage girls
[34:58.160 --> 35:03.560]  Not paying his fucking like mods who do work for him and like other stuff and I'm like dude
[35:04.560 --> 35:06.560]  I
[35:11.760 --> 35:13.760]  How man
[35:16.160 --> 35:25.360]  Like just be a normal human it's not that bad like I take it for me being a normal dude, it's not that bad
[35:34.560 --> 35:36.560]  You
[36:04.560 --> 36:06.560]  You
[36:35.320 --> 36:37.320]  You
[36:40.200 --> 36:48.160]  Sorry, I was distracted no, uh, yeah, I don't know man. I swear to God people are just stupid as fuck people were idiots
[36:50.160 --> 36:55.600]  There's got to be some psychological underline issue with people's brains not working, but it is what it is
[36:58.760 --> 37:01.280]  Huh, I've had this bar cut account for a while
[37:05.160 --> 37:10.960]  Dude what is that tarik skin?
[37:13.720 --> 37:17.520]  You see this we this tarik skin man, he's fabulous
[37:18.600 --> 37:22.560]  Good day. My man's just straight up fabulous
[37:35.240 --> 37:37.240]  People are desperate I
[37:38.520 --> 37:43.920]  Just can't like I don't think like I've been in the situation where I was like a really really big streamer
[37:44.320 --> 37:49.680]  Like much bigger than he is and I got like this is what I'm saying is like I understand
[37:51.720 --> 37:56.360]  Like all of the crap that gets thrown at you like people will literally message you for no reason
[37:56.760 --> 38:01.480]  Like you do have like fans that have like when I was at my biggest point
[38:01.480 --> 38:04.800]  Like you have fans that are younger girls guy
[38:04.800 --> 38:08.760]  It doesn't matter and like you just got a like I just never in my mind
[38:08.760 --> 38:10.920]  I guess thought like oh, I'm gonna flirt with these people like
[38:11.600 --> 38:17.960]  It made me like I don't even I wouldn't even I literally didn't even see them as like sexual in my brain
[38:22.520 --> 38:24.520]  Like it blows my mind
[38:26.720 --> 38:31.000]  And then the fact that like if you like if you look at the Google Doc or whatever
[38:31.880 --> 38:36.280]  The fact that like taco like I keep a taco whatever it was literally talking to him
[38:36.680 --> 38:40.160]  Telling him he was doing it like what he was doing was wrong. He was like, yeah, I get it, right?
[38:40.680 --> 38:42.680]  Then he did it again
[38:53.040 --> 39:00.360]  Dude the set alting the pussy that that I'll be on it that may be one of the funniest lines I've ever heard
[39:01.480 --> 39:03.480]  I
[39:15.160 --> 39:20.400]  Like dude, I mean whatever, you know, I'm not here to kink shame whatever gets people off, you know, maybe maybe
[39:20.800 --> 39:22.800]  Maybe that's a fetish. I don't know
[39:31.480 --> 39:33.480]  I
[39:54.880 --> 39:59.680]  Safe and sounds either way
[40:01.480 --> 40:09.120]  We cannot talk about the drama real quick. We can talk about how old and washed up wings that there's though
[40:26.280 --> 40:28.280]  I'm kidding
[40:32.440 --> 40:34.840]  Yo, did you see on a lighter note though, did you see riot?
[40:35.960 --> 40:42.560]  There was like a reddit thread or something where riot was saying that they're like gonna try and do something about smurfing in the next few months. I
[40:44.480 --> 40:46.480]  Don't know what that means
[40:47.600 --> 40:49.600]  But
[40:50.360 --> 40:52.360]  I
[40:55.240 --> 41:00.920]  Do you tell us something involving wings just between us? Yeah, yeah, just between us and all the homies yeah

[43:26.720 --> 43:28.720]  Really want this plate
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  Dude a nibbius roaming
[43:39.440 --> 43:49.960]  Why is there a wukong just sitting top by the way, that's actually hilarious
[43:56.760 --> 43:58.760]  You know it's interesting I
[43:59.760 --> 44:01.760]  I
[44:03.520 --> 44:09.920]  Feel like Tarek actually missed that stun. I was kind of side eyeing that but I feel like he missed that stone somehow
[44:29.440 --> 44:31.440]  I
[44:31.720 --> 44:36.280]  Feel like this is the easiest game I've ever played by the way, I'm on full autopilot
[44:36.920 --> 44:41.960]  Brain still waking up and I feel like they're just walking into me on repeat. I'm just killing them all I
[44:42.680 --> 44:44.680]  Don't even know what the fuck's going on
[44:45.560 --> 44:50.800]  Like they it feels like the enemy team has not like they didn't they didn't like understand we were playing league
[44:51.240 --> 44:53.720]  Right like they queued up and they were like, oh, yeah, this is league
[44:54.960 --> 44:56.960]  That's what this feels like
[44:57.600 --> 45:01.640]  This is what I imagine if like Mike Tyson went into a preschool, you know what I mean like this is what this feels like
[45:21.680 --> 45:23.680]  My say
[45:26.960 --> 45:28.960]  I
[45:33.600 --> 45:37.940]  Probably could have killed those guys but I don't want to the chill
[45:47.080 --> 45:49.360]  I'm assuming the wukong is gonna come by soon
[45:54.440 --> 45:56.440]  There is
[45:56.960 --> 45:58.960]  I
[46:02.240 --> 46:05.780]  Amit I quenched late I actually kill both
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  That's a late cleanse by me
[46:09.200 --> 46:11.200]  my bed
[46:11.840 --> 46:13.840]  I don't want to take the risk coming back up
[46:14.840 --> 46:19.480]  She stuns me they get one shot me. I should have killed the fucking guy though
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.280]  The wukong I just backed up too far and then I quenched the stun for no like really late
[46:26.960 --> 46:28.960]  I
[46:35.000 --> 46:40.960]  Jer it was a man. It's a boys. Good evening. Good evening. Good morning. I don't know where the fuck you guys live
[46:40.960 --> 46:42.960]  So good day
[46:42.960 --> 46:44.960]  I
[46:55.120 --> 46:57.120]  Fuck am I watching
[47:05.800 --> 47:07.800]  Wait that wukong lived
[47:12.960 --> 47:14.960]  Whoa, bro, oh
[47:16.360 --> 47:18.360]  I'm dead
[47:19.200 --> 47:21.200]  Dude that wall was BS
[47:23.200 --> 47:27.280]  There was like a little hole and then I flashed late because I was like, oh I could walk out the hole
[47:27.800 --> 47:29.800]  But I couldn't walk out the tiny little hole
[47:31.880 --> 47:37.200]  Mother fuckers I shouldn't have even been there, but like I'm stupid I
[47:38.040 --> 47:46.440]  Should just push bot I was like dude that's such a bad fight, but I walked over to those like I'm really fat
[47:47.520 --> 47:50.840]  Honestly, I probably could have killed him if I didn't say if I like flashed the
[47:52.080 --> 47:54.080]  fun
[47:55.440 --> 47:57.440]  Annie stuns the only
[47:58.000 --> 48:03.720]  Like most over like I swear if they reduced any stun by like point five seconds. She would never get played
[48:04.720 --> 48:06.560]  Like actually
[48:06.560 --> 48:10.040]  The only reason to play Annie is her stun is just so OP
[48:10.720 --> 48:16.840]  Because it's like a it's like the reason they changed tarak so long ago where like when you have a point click CC
[48:20.280 --> 48:22.280]  It's typically really broken
[48:31.120 --> 48:33.120]  Okay, I'm just dead
[48:33.720 --> 48:35.920]  Does tarak not have all leveled up at six
[48:41.440 --> 48:43.440]  He didn't love was ulti
[48:57.120 --> 48:59.120]  Wow
[49:00.120 --> 49:02.880]  Maybe it's maybe Terakold sucks
[49:04.880 --> 49:10.080]  Maybe it's underpowered, you know no, yeah, you must have misclicked
[49:19.200 --> 49:22.540]  Honestly, I'm just briefing I'm like playing to aggro for like
[49:23.560 --> 49:26.160]  Like I threw my lead because I was like, oh shit
[49:26.160 --> 49:31.080]  I'm gonna walk over and help the homies you never walk over and help the homies when the homies are getting shit on because
[49:32.320 --> 49:37.120]  If you have like 900 gold or a thousand gold lead like like I did or whatever you don't want to do that because
[49:37.800 --> 49:40.160]  You'll give MF a ton of kills
[49:43.400 --> 49:45.400]  We're in a good spot now though
[49:45.400 --> 49:47.400]  I
[49:54.200 --> 49:58.240]  Am still a little wait Terak, oh, I've always old winners
[50:00.560 --> 50:02.960]  This Terak does not know how to play Terak by the way
[50:05.160 --> 50:07.160]  He's throwing out his stun so awkwardly
[50:10.880 --> 50:13.920]  That's okay though, I mean I apparently don't know how to play driving so
[50:15.920 --> 50:17.920]  I
[50:18.320 --> 50:20.320]  Can't really blame the guy I
[50:24.880 --> 50:27.280]  Mean you guys are doing dragon with no smite
[50:31.200 --> 50:33.400]  But it seems like doing dragon with no smite
[50:33.400 --> 50:35.400]  I
[50:44.600 --> 50:49.640]  Mean we could fight these fights, but it's like painful
[50:52.200 --> 50:54.200]  We could easily fight these fights I
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  Think a lot of it is just like
[50:58.400 --> 51:03.060]  Terak isn't confident enough to walk up and stun right like that's that's what I'm seeing the issue is
[51:03.440 --> 51:08.120]  He's doing the thing where like he's not he doesn't have the confidence to actually walk up since he's a melee champ
[51:11.640 --> 51:14.120]  So he's walking up and like taking half his health
[51:15.120 --> 51:17.120]  And it's making him nervous
[51:17.320 --> 51:19.320]  It happens a lot with players
[51:19.800 --> 51:22.960]  Who are very melee champ centric?
[51:23.880 --> 51:26.880]  Because melee supports are actually pretty risky or they're pretty scary rather
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  I
[51:37.480 --> 51:43.880]  Always totally dead. Oh no, we're not but yeah, melee supports are scary to play because you have to know
[51:45.240 --> 51:48.160]  When you can get a kill by going in because you're gonna take damage, right?
[51:49.880 --> 51:52.480]  That's just like the nature of melee supports
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  Nice
[51:58.400 --> 52:03.760]  We're coming back in a bit not bad we threw a little bit early, but yeah, we're starting to get it back
[52:07.160 --> 52:09.160]  Terak's a never-good I
[52:09.440 --> 52:15.600]  I'm always confused by Terak because he feels like such a good champion like the champion itself feels broken as shit
[52:17.440 --> 52:20.240]  Like whatever I whenever I see Terak, I think to myself like
[52:20.920 --> 52:25.720]  He's either unkillably like super OP or
[52:27.160 --> 52:29.160]  They're like
[52:29.600 --> 52:31.200]  0 and 10
[52:31.200 --> 52:35.080]  There's no in between right like they either know how to play Terak or they don't is what it feels like
[52:35.080 --> 52:37.080]  Oh
[52:49.400 --> 52:52.640]  You I mean yeah, you are wrong Terak actually requires mechanics
[52:54.240 --> 52:56.240]  That's actually true
[52:56.480 --> 53:02.000]  Where's like most supports like not always doesn't have mechanics, you know and like what's crank doesn't have mechanics
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.760]  They just hit their button and if it if it works that they they get a kill
[53:08.080 --> 53:11.680]  Whereas like Terak after you stun there is like stuff you have to do that does make sense
[53:26.840 --> 53:28.840]  Or block
[53:29.840 --> 53:33.040]  Do you think oh I'm gonna die oh
[53:35.040 --> 53:37.040]  Thank God
[53:38.720 --> 53:42.440]  Do you think Terak's one of the harder supports I think he's I think he's pretty hard
[53:45.120 --> 53:51.080]  But I don't think he's well I mean he's harder than the other supports like I think like I don't think there's a single support
[53:51.080 --> 53:55.160]  That's hard. I know I'm I'm toxic for that, but I
[53:56.080 --> 53:58.080]  Stand by it
[53:58.840 --> 54:00.840]  I
[54:16.040 --> 54:18.040]  Mean I'm just gonna die I'm not gonna try and flash
[54:18.040 --> 54:21.120]  I don't think I should have just flashed over
[54:21.440 --> 54:26.760]  But I kind of got baited by the Terak ult I wanted to see if I could fight, but there's too much to see
[54:27.760 --> 54:30.040]  I was like oh he's ulting me. Let's go I
[54:31.920 --> 54:38.960]  Can tell this is a really low elo game because there's so much random deaths like I'm falling victim to like I'm auto-piloting and
[54:39.280 --> 54:43.000]  Like I'm not thinking and I'm just talking to you guys and I'm just dying for free
[54:43.280 --> 54:46.920]  But it's like there's so many people just dying for free. It's hilarious
[54:47.640 --> 54:50.660]  Thresh Thresh isn't actually that part so
[54:51.300 --> 54:57.740]  Like a lot of people think like Thresh mechanically is very difficult because he has harder than the other supports
[54:57.860 --> 55:04.660]  But he's not actually that hard. He's like once you learn the Thresh combos. He's pretty much a
[55:06.020 --> 55:08.260]  Very upfront champion
[55:12.620 --> 55:14.620]  Yeah, like
[55:15.060 --> 55:23.140]  Like lantern for example is one of the most broken things to ever be put in league and everybody fucks it up
[55:23.820 --> 55:28.260]  Like people will will just mess up lantern because they'll throw it for souls or they'll mess up
[55:28.260 --> 55:30.900]  like you can literally just hold lantern perma and
[55:31.740 --> 55:33.740]  Your ad carry can walk up
[55:34.660 --> 55:39.060]  Auto the turret and and and you literally like they literally can't play the game after that
[55:45.220 --> 55:48.540]  Like the enemy team I mean because like there's nothing they can do to stop it
[55:50.460 --> 55:52.460]  We can totally fight this by the way
[55:53.340 --> 55:57.260]  So like I've done that before where like my Thresh I know I have a good throw. Hold on
[55:57.260 --> 55:59.260]  Let me let me win this team fight really quick
[56:00.380 --> 56:02.380]  Give me a sec
[56:14.620 --> 56:29.940]  Okay, cool, sorry I had to win that team power quick. Okay, so as I was saying there's a lot more to Thresh than
[56:31.260 --> 56:33.260]  People think right
[56:33.260 --> 56:37.220]  It's essentially people over complicate like what he needs to do
[56:37.500 --> 56:40.740]  So it's like Thresh is a very basic tip like when you see Thresh in pro play
[56:40.860 --> 56:44.620]  You you don't ever see like what you do, but it's very rare that you see like the sick
[56:45.180 --> 56:50.380]  Permal hooking like oh my god, like it's mainly like they pick him for like lantern
[56:51.420 --> 56:52.660]  It's right up
[56:52.660 --> 56:56.500]  Like when they when they pick Thresh and hi, you know, he's not picked to be the god tier like
[56:56.900 --> 57:02.380]  Always landing permacy see hooks like flay god like he's picked to like shut down engage and
[57:03.700 --> 57:05.540]  remove
[57:05.540 --> 57:08.060]  Kill threat to your carries. That's all he's picked for
[57:10.740 --> 57:12.740]  That's he's literally just an EW bot
[57:14.940 --> 57:20.020]  Armor stacking I mean, yeah, the armor thing on Thresh is nice, but it's I wouldn't say it's like OP on his kit
[57:22.340 --> 57:26.100]  It just makes him like not died to 80 carries in two seconds
[57:29.860 --> 57:31.860]  What what has happened
[57:33.380 --> 57:37.980]  But I instantly know I'm playing with a good Thresh player when I can walk up to the turret
[57:41.700 --> 57:43.700]  When I can walk up to the turret and the threat
[57:55.540 --> 57:59.060]  Sorry, I was trying to think and talk at the same time when I can walk up to the turret
[57:59.060 --> 58:03.020]  My Thresh player won't walk up an auto the turret with me. That's like the sign of a good Thresh player
[58:03.940 --> 58:09.140]  When we don't know where the enemy is and instead of walking up and trying to hit the turret to like help you kill the turret
[58:09.220 --> 58:13.700]  They'll stand in the back and literally just sit there and wait and hold lantern until
[58:16.820 --> 58:21.300]  They just hold their lantern until like you can until you get ganked essentially
[58:24.380 --> 58:29.060]  And that's why I like I said, I just personally don't think Thresh is mechanics. There's hard as people think I
[58:29.540 --> 58:33.400]  Do think he's he's very knowledge based like I think Thresh has high knowledge caps
[58:34.280 --> 58:41.800]  Where like if you're playing I don't know like Lulu your skill is basically like do I w your your decision making on Lulu is literally
[58:42.520 --> 58:49.960]  Do I w to speed or do I w to cc right like that's your that's your like decision making so it's like obviously much higher than that
[58:51.080 --> 58:53.080]  but it's uh
[58:54.600 --> 58:56.440]  You son of a bitch
[58:56.440 --> 58:58.440]  But it's still not like that bad
[58:59.240 --> 59:01.480]  I think Thresh just intimidates people because
[59:02.200 --> 59:04.200]  He can do so much
[59:04.680 --> 59:09.080]  And so I think people just get intimidated but because they they think it looks overwhelming to learn the champ
[59:13.960 --> 59:18.200]  I feel like that actually intimidates a lot of people in terms of like people not wanting to
[59:19.080 --> 59:21.080]  learn new champions and shits
[59:21.880 --> 59:23.880]  I feel like a lot of it is just
[59:24.680 --> 59:26.120]  um
[59:26.120 --> 59:28.840]  People are nervous about learning champions that look overwhelming
[59:29.640 --> 59:31.640]  right
[59:32.520 --> 59:37.960]  Like a felios for example, I was talking about this yesterday a felios is not a hard mechanical champion like
[59:38.760 --> 59:40.760]  he's difficult in terms of
[59:41.640 --> 59:44.600]  The knowledge required like he's knowledge gated very hard
[59:45.400 --> 59:51.640]  Right, so like you have to play him a decent amount or like research him to understand what guns do what
[59:52.120 --> 59:57.000]  How to interact with the guns stuff like that right but the actual mechanics of using the guns
[59:57.800 --> 59:59.800]  It's actually not hard
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.360]  Guys, what are we doing?
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.880]  I guess we're just winning the fight
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.840]  Pike
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.640]  Like like I think pike's harder than thresh
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:29.320]  Maybe that's a hot take but I think pike is harder than thresh
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.200]  Because pike requires like really specific
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:40.280]  Pike is a lot harder to play than he looks
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.720]  When you see people play him
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:48.520]  Because there's like timers of when you can go in off of certain things
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.520]  Like hitting his ulti consistently in team fights is a little harder than people think
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.600]  and
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.600]  Knowing how to position in the lane like pike is capable of a lot more than people think
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.680]  So I think pikes
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:03.880]  I think the reason the main reason I think pikes a little harder is because he's melee
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:15.480]  Like melee champions are always going to be like mechanically more difficult than ranged if the melee champion is like
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:23.320]  You have to engage to go in and do stuff because there's always the counter play factor
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:36.360]  Support role yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's like I'm not saying overall like overall ranged champions require a lot more mechanicsthan melee
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.120]  Just because you're ranged you can die in a global and you have to space and stuff
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.200]  But I think that like in just the support you support support specific
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:49.000]  I think may lays are a lot harder to play. That's why you see a lot of like support players
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.440]  We give like the best support players in the world are really good at like the engage melee supports
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.640]  Not the like enchanters and that's why you see like why we praise
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.440]  the best support players
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:08.440]  Because like when you see somebody go in like perfectly on rakan or go in like find a way in without getting knocked up on like
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.520]  I don't know
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.720]  something
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.520]  Like when they find the angle and thrash him, it's really nice
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:34.440]  Well, I think rel sucks. I think that champ is so bad because she just like
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.320]  She doesn't do anything
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:42.280]  Like rel's rel's initial thing was like she was supposed to go in
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:47.720]  Be really tanky and then be like a stun bot for like team fights. She was a team fight monster
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.280]  but the problem with rel is like
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:57.320]  She has one chance essentially in lane phase like if anybody has fingers on their hands and they can move left and right
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.960]  rel's really easy to dodge
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.120]  Like it's actually like it's incredibly easy to dodge
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:06.360]  Like it's actually like it's incredibly easy to beat a rel in lane to not die to her
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:13.080]  Like you just have to move left and right right. It's very simple. So it's like it's much more difficult to dodge like
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.040]  Other engage champs if that makes sense like not unless you can still move left and right
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.120]  But it's like he can walk at you while it's happening
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.680]  Where it's like if rel walks at you
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.640]  I'm still like just waiting for the animation and then I can simply move to the left
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.520]  Because like her
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:38.360]  Animation is so slow on using her ability that I can like dash I can flash I can there's so much counter play
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.320]  And it's like unless she flashes on you, but it's even then you can tell she's gonna flash on you. So it's like
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.880]  I also feel like mid game rel has this issue where
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:55.000]  She has her one trick ulti engage fight in team fights, but after she does that she does literally nothing
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.240]  Right she's like a one and done
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:03.080]  That's why like she feels like she doesn't have other expression
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.040]  She's countered so hard by the meta too
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.920]  Milio counters rel engage
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.880]  Thresh counters rel engage
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:23.080]  Right like either either of those champions shits on rel engage and you can't do anything
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.720]  Like
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.960]  I don't know if you've ever tried to play rel
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:39.880]  Gone in and been like
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.240]  Thresh flayed
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.240]  But it's the worst feeling
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.200]  It's a bad feeling
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.840]  It's like when people play leona it's the same reason leona is shit right now
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.760]  like
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.760]  They both have the same idea of why they're bad, right?
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:59.080]  They like have they're both good at doing what they're supposed to do
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:03.640]  Like you know stone and create pressure and point clicking shit, but the problem is is like
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.600]  You can easily counter pick them so incredibly hard that they just become worthless the whole game
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.760]  Have you ever gotten sent a secondary mission? Oh all the time
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:21.880]  With sent up being like with thresh being meta and sent up being like a champion i'm playing a lot
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.880]  I get that all the time
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.880]  You don't even notice it though i'm gonna be real
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:34.120]  When you kill the thresh or whatever and you get his souls you don't even fucking notice it because like it's like 40 armor
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.760]  And it's like your level 17 or some shit at that point
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:47.320]  Like at the point you're getting it you're such a high level that like the 40 random armor like it's nice
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.400]  But i never really notice it
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.400]  I
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:01.880]  Trying to get our teammates ahead isn't that good you don't have actually been doing uh as support on my main account
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.520]  I've actually been
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.440]  Roaming non-stop and it's super op
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  Because the key to roaming is
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.720]  All you have to do to roam well
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.200]  Is literally be there
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:26.760]  One or two times in the first five minutes of the game to completely fuck over
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:34.520]  The enemy one time on an engage or something and they get so far behind from it that you can literally just walk back bot
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:43.240]  Like i do on center like i'll push bot lane this is this is my strategy on center i'm gonna give it to you guys okay
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:49.080]  So i don't i don't know if this works in low elo, but in like masters like high masters this works at least
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:53.880]  This is all i do on center every single player i play against on center
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:59.480]  Every single one except for like pike players even nautilus blitz they they all concede lane level one
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.080]  Every single one of them right they just they just let me push level one
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:05.880]  And so i'll push the waves in level one
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:12.600]  And i'll either crash wave two or wave three depending on how far they're giving me like push power right
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:17.640]  So i will always crash wave two or wave three bot and i will immediately
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.080]  roam mid
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.080]  every time
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.680]  and
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.680]  Even if i don't get a kill
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:32.120]  Usually it fucks over the enemy mid laner so badly because on that exact timer
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.680]  There's usually a gank happening on min
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.640]  So
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:47.800]  A lot of the time people think that you're roaming to get a kill for the laner you're not you're roaming to counter
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:50.840]  pressure from the other players in the game
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:58.520]  How many times have you guys been like oh we can win this 2v2 you see the enemy jungler your jungler comes
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:02.600]  You're like oh we're gonna bait this and then all of a sudden the support shows up and you're like god damn it
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:05.240]  And then you die and you're like what the fuck
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:10.600]  That right there is how easy it is to play support because all you have to do is show up
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:12.440]  once
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.560]  twice
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.280]  And now that entire lane is fucked for the enemy team
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.800]  Roaming is so easy
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:30.440]  The only thing people fuck up roaming really bad when they roam on timers where their adc can't safely farm
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:35.320]  So what ends up happening is on that timer right where like i told you wave 2 3 right?
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:42.440]  What happens is you push that wave and you roam mid let's say nothing happens. Okay. I can just walk back bot
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.000]  It's you lose nothing
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.560]  And usually at that point you're not you have like three inner gold so there's no point in backing right now
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.200]  Let's say like i noticed that my jungler is like
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.040]  invading top side. I just walk over to top and help him
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.400]  Because you have like three to four
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:06.520]  You have like three to four waves before the enemy bot lane the enemy bot lane has to play it almost perfectly
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.960]  To be able to abuse your roam on certain timers
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.880]  They essentially have to play it perfect to abuse the roam
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.440]  What i mean by that is like
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:23.800]  The way the best way to abuse uh support roaming is you either a
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.720]  If you have the ability to dive you can pretty much a
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:34.680]  Immediately dive like push the next wave and then immediately dive if you like have that ability say you're playing
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:36.200]  We own a draven or something
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:41.880]  But even then it's a little risky because then the adc can just walk back and they only lose one wave and you gave up
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.520]  You know a stack chance. So it's not that bad
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.280]  two
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:50.840]  You can um stack the wave now stacking the wave is the best way to counter it
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:55.400]  Because let's say i'm roaming for an extended period you stack like a three wave
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.200]  And then all of a sudden you're crashing it and my and then you want to like you're up a level because you've been gaining xp
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.200]  And the adc has to back off
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:09.000]  But the way to counter that is you simply just walk back on the timer of the stacked wave crashing as an adc or as a support
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.640]  It's so incredibly easy to do
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.640]  It's actually brainlessly easy to do
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.360]  like all it's literally
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:22.680]  You can roam all you want bot lane as long as you are in bot lane for the stacked wave crashes
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:26.040]  Or you are in bot lane when your jungler is bot side of the map
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.680]  It's easy as fuck
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.360]  But support players drool on themselves so they like to essentially
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:46.120]  Support players like to like afk in the lane phase. They like to literally sit there and just do nothing
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:51.960]  That's like the average support I see is they will stand and do nothing
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:59.320]  And and I've said this before but I'll say it again being a good support is not being a better player in the enemy team
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.360]  Being a good support is queuing up to play league of legends
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:09.240]  That's that's all it takes all it takes to be a good support is queuing up with the intent to push buttons in the game
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.440]  And not just afk
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.680]  You
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.160]  Hmm
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.680]  You
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.680]  You
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:54.680]  You
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.680]  You
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.680]  You
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:24.680]  You
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:55.640]  You
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:06.280]  All right, I'm back. What's up? I don't remember what we're talking about. Oh supports. Yeah, they're all stupid
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:15.240]  Don't afk on support you'll gain LP. It's that it's that it's actually that easy
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.400]  I
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:35.080]  Honestly, I don't think supports are stupid. I think it's more of a how do I phrase this it's in my opinion. It's more of like a
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:39.720]  They're like they've never they don't have to learn
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.240]  Support players like don't have to learn
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:53.080]  Important things because they can get away with not doing it so they get they develop bad habits. That's all it is
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.000]  Do you have a Spotify playlist? Yeah
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.640]  Best role to climb
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:14.440]  I think every role is good to climb as long as you're good
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.160]  Classic jara. Oh, I don't see
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:21.400]  Whatever you linked like I don't know how links in the chat because I had to turn them off a long time ago
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.840]  So I can't see it
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.440]  I would say the climbing is just about like whatever
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.400]  Because every role you can climb on right like every single role
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:39.320]  So climbing a lot of the time is just about what you think
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:48.120]  Is most fun for you and you can get the best that I would say
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.080]  objectively
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:54.520]  The best roles to climb on are jungle and support for just like
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:59.720]  higher elo well jungle and lower elo support and higher elo
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.240]  I wouldn't climb on support in like gold
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:07.960]  Because you're not gonna have a good time trying to like help bad players play the game
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.560]  Bad that's mean
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:16.040]  People who don't like you can get it like a gold ezreal 30 kills by being the better support
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.120]  But you won't always win
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:22.120]  Whereas like if you really want to control solo queue and your teammates aren't like
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:28.680]  Good enough to carry at that level by themselves, right like you get frustrated just pick something that
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.240]  Has more agency in the game
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.480]  You lost 18 of 24 is jungle you want to turn any role
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.560]  I mean you could play it if if you think it's any carries
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.600]  Interesting, I wouldn't say it's like fun
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.120]  But it's not it's not bad
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:00.280]  You're in gold
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.120]  I mean you could try it
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.600]  My view on it is if people were wondering if they want to play a role or not
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.120]  My view is just try it see if you like it because if you don't like the role
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:11.080]  You're not going to be able to put in enough games to get good at the role, right? So like
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:14.360]  Just give it a try see if you enjoy it or not
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:17.640]  And if like it's not fun then if it's not your playstyle, it's not fun
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.840]  Because 80s are a unique playstyle from all the other roles
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.600]  Like there the reason
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:29.720]  People don't like playing ad carry and like like watching ad carry streamers and shit
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.800]  Is because it ad carry is like it's boring
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.040]  Ad carry is like
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.080]  Zero like like if there was a graph of shit going on when you're playing ad carry in the game
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:47.480]  It's like this that is like spikes to a hundred and then it's back to like this, right?
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.440]  It's like
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:55.080]  Ad carry is a lot of every game is different
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.200]  Right every game when you play 80s different
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:01.480]  uh because
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:05.080]  You're always with a different player like a different support unless you do oq
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:08.840]  So every ad carry's game's difference coupled with uh
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:14.040]  You spend a lot of the game just farming like you don't get to interact with the enemy a lot
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:18.680]  So you just kind of farm a lot of the game and even then you also like
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:24.280]  You basically are farming for like little dopamine hits of like team fights and stuff that you get around the game
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.440]  So that's kind of fun
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.080]  But it's like I said, it's all you you can climb on any role
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:35.080]  I think 80 carry requires the most mechanical skill to climb because
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.120]  The difference between uh
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.080]  Climbing is like a jungler is about being in the right spot at the right time, right?
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.800]  Like you need to path this way get objectives, etc
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:49.640]  Climbing isn't 80 carry is more about like this person fucked up their positioning. I'm gonna kill them type shit
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.080]  So
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.520]  Concentrate of Q
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.760]  Also, I want to I want to say something uh
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.800]  If you are playing
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:28.440]  Make sure and this is just a really good standardized bit of advice
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:33.320]  Make sure you're always tracking what the enemy cooldowns are what their spells are stuff like that
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:40.760]  Okay, because playing the game is is not just about like farming and and you know
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.880]  Like your team goes into you auto and shits like right now mid's mia, right?
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:49.400]  I can see that varus is mia, but it is a varus. So like i'm not too worried about being like level 2'd by varus
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:53.800]  Not that much right so I can kind of play backward because I know that
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:21:00.040]  It's a high chance. He's not gonna run bottom level 2 as a varus now. That was like a fizz or some shit. I immediately back up
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:06.360]  So we notice that it's pretty obvious recon probably got w level 2. We don't know what it is, but he has q
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:08.680]  So he doesn't have shield, which means
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.120]  Because he doesn't have shield
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:19.640]  Uh, it's hard for the recon to get back out if he fucks up and engage
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:25.720]  So you need to think about these type of things right now. This is wave 4. I believe and because it's wave 4
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:31.320]  We're gonna get level 3 on wave 4. You always get level 3 on wave 4 if you have full xp
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.120]  You get level 2 on wave 2
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:41.640]  And you get level 3 on wave 4 and uh these timers for when you get
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:45.560]  Certain level ups bottling are very important
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:51.800]  Now I'm gonna hover over here. Uh, you see how fiddle is right here
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.720]  I'm actually gonna just walk in here and see if I can like
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.320]  Yeah, we see him nice
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:04.200]  See this is exactly what I was talking about before. Do you see what my support is doing?
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.160]  I I left the lane
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:14.280]  Guys I walked to like stand next to my jungler after we pushed the wave in my lulu
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  Is hanging out by herself bot lane
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.400]  But she's just chilling
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:40.600]  You don't want to do that
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:45.480]  You don't ever want to be the guy who's like by yourself bot lane as a support
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.200]  because
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.920]  You don't like supports don't need gold right not really
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.800]  And you don't need farm. You don't need all that shit
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:58.760]  So if you're adc rooms and unless the wave is fucked and they're just being stupid and you have to fix the wave or something
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.240]  You don't want to be by yourself in the lane
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.560]  It just doesn't do anything
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:08.680]  How about an auto tower? Oh, uh, I used uh
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.520]  Tilda
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:14.840]  So there's a way there's actually a setting you can have in the game where when you hit a button
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:22.760]  It makes it so that I can't physically hit anything but a champion. It's target. It's called target champions only
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:26.920]  And it's basically like here. I'll do it for you right now watch. You see how like I can hit the tower
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.160]  You see how it's the red
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:31.400]  sword
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:34.840]  So when I hit this button, I can no longer hit the tower or the minions
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:38.120]  But I can still hit the champions
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:45.480]  So essentially when you're fighting in a big minion wave or you're fighting under turret, you don't want to miss click
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:49.160]  You just hit target champions only button
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:53.800]  And it makes it a thousand times easier because you can literally only hit the champion
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:58.440]  It's really nice
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:00.840]  And
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:11.320]  You can make the button anything you want obviously I just I use tilde. It's the default
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:21.560]  I actually want to kill these guys, but I need to wait for the wave to push out just the hair
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:24.840]  The jungler could be bought but it is a fiddle stick
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:28.680]  So it's like I don't really care about a fiddle stick being bought we can straight up just kill them
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.400]  Okay, well apparently we can't kill them
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.960]  Because apparently my Lulu didn't want to walk up
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:57.480]  That's so frustrating man. I did fuck up my uh my auto there, but I am a little
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.960]  I am kind of curious what happens
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.760]  I'd have to go watch the Vod. I fucked up my kill in the Zaya
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:06.360]  I think I walked left instead or down my movement was bad
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:10.920]  Like essentially when they fought right I walked like this. I should have walked like this
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:17.880]  Because you want to cut off the Zaya from the gank now. I do think when Lulu just blindly ran away
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:23.000]  I think she kind of grieved you don't need to insta run from ganks, especially when like you could see what I have right?
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  I have Dirk and Sheen
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:31.160]  Something that a lot of people do as well is they will see that like the numbers are uneven and they'll instantly run away
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:35.000]  They don't think about like how to win the fight or like what the the win con is of the fight
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:41.080]  Because that's what I was saying before we got ganked right I was like fiddle can't gank us and he can't pre-6 fiddle does nothing in the gank
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.320]  I had cleanse
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:45.320]  They don't actually beat us in 3v2
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:51.160]  So the problem was is we weren't focusing the same target. I went for the zaya and she backed really far up
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.040]  Now if we had played forward a bit
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:59.000]  Like say she played a little more forward with me that would have gone a lot better or if I had played a little more back with her
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:02.840]  It was basically like we don't have comms. So the you know, it got rough
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.520]  Now fiddle is six now. So it's a little scary
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:13.480]  I don't like playing versus fiddle sticks for like the reason of like 90% of the time
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:18.200]  Players don't know how to ward around fiddle people put wards in weird spots
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:24.600]  We should have won that fight though. I'm a little salty mainly myself
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:34.680]  So this too, Lulu keeps speeding me up
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:37.560]  um
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.520]  I want to be honest with you. I don't like when lulus do that
[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:46.280]  It's like a pet peeve thing of mine when lulus use their speed
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:50.600]  Like I'm okay with it if I need to dodge something or I need to chase somebody
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.520]  But I think it's just so much less value than using it to cc early game
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:27:02.360]  Early game the cc of lulu like using w is so broken to me because they they just physically can't move their character for
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:05.400]  Like 1.5 seconds, which is crazy
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:10.280]  I
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.960]  Think fiddles bot
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:16.680]  You can kind of tell
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:20.520]  You see how they're playing really aggressive
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:23.240]  They don't beat us 2v2
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.880]  So I'm thinking and they just cleared this ward out
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:31.160]  I'm thinking fiddle is either on dragon or he's bush ganking bot somewhere
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:35.240]  So I don't really want to walk up
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:42.520]  You see how this guy is confidently hitting the turret. This is making me think fiddles trying to lane gank
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:47.400]  Because they cannot beat us 2v2
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.640]  Like I think fiddles in here
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.400]  So I'm actually just gonna play safe
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:58.520]  Until we see him on the map. I don't know
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:01.640]  I'm not gonna take the chance
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.880]  Because uh
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:15.400]  You got to think about like what you see and what you don't see on the map like we can't physically see fiddle right?
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:17.800]  But think about this. We don't see him top
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:23.240]  That's something you have to think about we we had a ward on rift just now for 15 15 seconds, right?
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.120]  We didn't see him top
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:28.920]  So like if he's not top, where is he?
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.720]  Now I think he finally left this looks like he went to dragon
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:40.200]  Yeah
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:53.880]  What are we doing by the way, I mean I guess I'm just gonna die
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:02.920]  Now would be the time to speed me. I mean, I don't even know what to say about that malzahar just didn't walk
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.920]  I
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.520]  Gragas didn't flash as e
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  malzahar didn't walk
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:14.520]  You always walk there by the way. I want to make this clear
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:18.520]  If you're a mid laner and you're playing a late game scaling mid
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:23.880]  You always walk to the fight no matter what though if it's at if it's going if it's doing that
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:27.640]  Okay, guys
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:31.960]  We need to walk to fights and lulu you need to
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:35.240]  Follow up when I go in don't run
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.280]  I'm just gonna type it because I'm actually fucking annoying
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:43.560]  I'm a little frustrated
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:49.800]  I still think the game is 100% winnable, but I'm playing draven. We're playing like I'm playing fucking ezreal or some shit
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:56.280]  And I can't walk up because essentially we know fiddle was bought for the last two three minutes, right? He just sat down there
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:07.480]  What is my lulu doing bro, what are you doing?
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:14.920]  No, we we fight this go yeah, this guy doesn't get to do this for free
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:24.760]  Now they have a gale force so I need to be a little care this guy has no ulti though
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:30.680]  Like this is what I'm losing my mind man
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:33.960]  I dude just
[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:42.280]  No, what she was doing what she was trying to protect her ward
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:46.200]  She saw the recon hitting the ward
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.680]  But the zaya walked up to get a free to just die
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:53.480]  The problem is my lulu was like, oh, I don't want to give up my ward and she wasn't thinking
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:01.800]  Please uh just sit with me, okay
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:08.040]  Yep, sorry I need you to follow me always
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:14.460]  Even if it looks scary you gotta follow okay
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:25.000]  Also, uh
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.120]  One thing is there's actually not a lot of fighting that happens in lower elo
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:33.520]  So a lot of these players don't know how to fight early because
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:38.400]  One thing that I think has gotten really bad about league lately just in the past few years
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.240]  Is people don't ever limit test and league ever anymore
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.880]  They always just play like pussies
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:47.920]  Every single player in league plays like a fucking pussy nowadays
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:51.520]  And it's it's literally just like sad to see
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:32:04.720]  Like right there why aren't we wing use w on the zaya
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:08.560]  Not too speed
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.000]  Like
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.560]  I'm losing my mind because all you have to do there is w the zaya she gets cc'd we kill her in the w
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:20.800]  I'm telling you lulu players are like hard wired
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:25.200]  For some reason to not play correctly
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:44.560]  I'm never gonna catch this guy he's got gale forcing tier two boots
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:54.240]  Yeah, I mean I I have to go for it though because if I don't go for kills now the game's over
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:58.640]  So it's either we go for it or we lose so I'm willing to like look stupid
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.840]  Honestly this game was my fault for the one 2v3 that happened early
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:09.280]  I misplayed it and if I didn't misplay that we would have won the game off it
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:12.480]  Now the game's pretty much over
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:17.920]  Like it's solo queue so we can always come back but the problem is uh, I don't think
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:22.000]  We have good enough players to come back like look at what lulu's doing lulu
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:26.400]  Why are you bought solo at the moment? Think?
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:31.120]  Like what?
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.320]  What are we doing?
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:44.800]  This is exactly what I was telling you guys doesn't make sense
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:47.920]  Remember when I told you supports easy all you have to do
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:53.440]  Is be a human remember what I said that 40 sec or four minutes ago before the game started
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:00.080]  All you have to do to play support is think push buttons and be active in the game
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:02.640]  And if you can do those things you'll get challenger on support
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:11.200]  Like it blows my mind like look what you did what are you doing?
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:33.920]  This is a this is a forfeit though. I'm gonna lose my minds
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:38.400]  Auto filled ad
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:44.160]  I'm gonna lose it
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:55.440]  My bad guess I'm an auto filled ad I'm just bad it's on me. I apologize
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.320]  Oh man these players are crazy
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:12.080]  I'm actually really surprised we're just not forfeiting now
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:20.240]  The best way to play the game is something that like I fall victim to to where I fuck this up sometimes right
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:22.800]  But the best way to play the game a lot of the time is
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:26.080]  You essentially don't play to take risks
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:32.560]  I know it sounds silly because you you got to find essentially you have to find the um
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:43.440]  My mouths are hard just let um let this guy this 1,000 gold walk away. Hey mouse
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:47.920]  If you moved by the way you get 1k gold
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.400]  Mid isn't hard roll I can mid in my sleep
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:02.480]  I
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:07.840]  It's not ad is easiest roll
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:22.560]  I'm ad carry streamer I play ad but Lulu is small brain
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.120]  I
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:34.000]  That was mean we took some some crossfire there that she didn't need to take that was my bad
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:38.480]  That was toxic
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:58.560]  I'll be real I think today is gonna be a mule kind of day
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:01.920]  Listening to low elo players talk about the game
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:05.680]  And then they think that they're right about the game and like how it works and all this shit
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:09.680]  It actually like hurts me like it shouldn't I should just laugh it off
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:15.600]  But sometimes when I see a low elo player talk about how they think the game should be played and I just know that they're wrong
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.320]  It actually like physically hurts me
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:23.520]  It does it physically hurts
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.680]  But I should follow my own rule where
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:40.000]  If you're playing with people that aren't as good like they don't see what you see
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:44.320]  Right there. There's like something where it's better to play safe and scale
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:49.360]  Even on driven it's better to play safe and scale than to go for plays in lane
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.040]  Mainly because
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:00.960]  If you go for plays in lane and let's say your support is not as good as you
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:05.600]  Or your support's not confident in their ability to 2v2 right then you're just gonna lose
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:09.120]  So you're like forcing that person to be in an uncomfortable situation
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:10.800]  so
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:13.920]  Like it's hard for me as a player to just play safe
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:16.720]  When I see the enemy making mistake after mistake
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:22.160]  It's like something that I have trouble like personally working on right just like a personal issue
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:27.040]  Where like I'll see an enemy make a mistake positional wise. I'm like, oh shit. Let's abuse this
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:29.520]  but a lot of the time the problem that happens is
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:34.640]  You have somebody who doesn't know that that person made a mistake or doesn't see the same mistake as me
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.240]  And because there's no comms. I can't relate to them that we should fight right
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:44.720]  So if I go in and they don't know that we should be fighting there, I I end up dying and it looks it feels really bad
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.520]  Which is I mean
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:54.320]  My fault. It's like a personal thing because you can't control your supports. You can only control yourself
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.520]  It's just something that like I suck at doing sometimes
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.520]  Right
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:04.080]  So that's just on me
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:10.240]  So
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:30.160]  We could actually kill the Zyra now by the way, she's like 60 hb like we could kill her
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.240]  So
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:58.480]  What is my braggast doing oh he got her though nice
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.040]  Bro use w
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:10.480]  To cc people
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.360]  Not to speed people
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.480]  That was a good example too. Oh well
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:32.240]  I just got to get better at doing that where I play safe though. That's on me. That's just a personal thing. I got to get better at
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.400]  I
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:03.360]  Oh, man, I think we're warmed up though. What ad carry do you guys want to see next game?
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:06.800]  That was that was a brutal ass game
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:09.680]  I'm gonna be real that was a brutal ass game
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:14.480]  What ad carry streamer do you guys want to see or ad carry stream what ad carry?
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:18.560]  Champion do you guys want to see this game?
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:27.120]  I just goofed up and tried to play too aggressive with a player that wasn't willing to play aggressive that was on me
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:30.880]  That's my bad
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:33.680]  I'll I'll play better
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:38.800]  I
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.360]  This guy this guy goes scion
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:01.600]  Oh never changed twitch chat never changed
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:08.800]  I
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:24.080]  Well the thing is is you have I have to change my mindset so like the thing
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:26.720]  Okay, let me explain something just like a personal thing with me
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:32.320]  I'm very very very good mechanically at this game right like it's my best trade is like I have very good mechanics
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:36.000]  So and I also have like an autistic weird brain
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:39.040]  Where I can see
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:41.840]  I have really good pattern recognition
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:48.480]  So when I see that the enemy is fucking up, I know that I'm pretty much always going to be better at the 2v2
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:51.520]  okay, so
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:55.040]  Because I know that I'm always going to be better at the 2v2
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:58.640]  I I always want to take the fight
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:04.320]  When I see that they make a mistake like they miss a skill shot or they walk up too far
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:09.360]  Stuff like that right but the problem is when you're balling you have to work with a teammate
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:14.000]  And that's part of just playing ad carry right and if you're in solo queue you can't always do it
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:16.160]  so you have to
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:18.160]  I I have to like train myself
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:24.000]  To just be okay with them making mistakes and us not abusing those mistakes
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:27.760]  It's very frustrating for me personally because i'm a perfectionist
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:32.320]  So it's very frustrating for me to like see this happening and i'm like, oh, I want to abuse this because I know we can
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:34.720]  but we have to like I have to like
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:41.760]  Tell myself not to and to just like not fuck up the wave state not take bad trades and shit because every time there's there's more toit too
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:46.960]  So if like I walk up and I take a fight right let's say like when rakan wed in when the fiddle ganked for example, right?
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.920]  Uh, if I take that fight
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:56.880]  I'm now banking that fight on lulu also playing correctly, right like they they missed all their abilities and they fucked up
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:59.680]  but I also messed like
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:06.080]  You nobody can play perfectly every game like I can't teammates can't nobody can it's league and we're all humans right?
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:11.840]  So you have to bank when you're doing that on like your teammate being able to know what you want to accomplish in that moment
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:17.840]  In solo queue with no comms and it's really hard like it's a really bad mindset that I have sometimes
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:21.040]  But it's hard to get over because like
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:25.920]  I like the laning phase for me is the most fun part of the game
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:32.320]  I love landing phase because in my opinion landing phase is like a little mini chess game between the enemy ball and right?
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:35.680]  It's like a it's like a chess game with like mechanics
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:37.360]  Where it's like
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:40.000]  How how well can like I auto space them right?
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000]  Can I can I space them well?
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:47.840]  Can I space them like can I by spacing? I mean can I walk into them trade and not take damage back, right?
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:52.480]  And I'm always thinking to myself. Okay, can I do that? I can and then I'm like I want to do this right?
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:53.440]  And then I'll like
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:59.040]  And then I'm like I want to do this right and then I'll like get somebody to half and then they'll panic and they'll engage on me
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:06.320]  And the problem is though is like I said without comms or without like people who are recognizing what you're trying to accomplish
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:11.120]  sometimes uh supports and in junglers people get flustered
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:18.160]  And it will go badly and it's my fault at the end of the day because I'm choosing to that play style of relying on my teammates
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:24.480]  Instead of like knowing that I can probably outscale and play better late game and just like keep good cs and not die and shit
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:26.960]  Which is what you guys should all do
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:33.600]  And that's what I tell people to do when they ask me how to play ad I tell you like don't die scale up get items
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:38.160]  but like because I've played the game for so long and my favorite part of the game is
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:45.040]  Lane phase and like winning lane and playing that little chess game. I fucked myself over in a lot of games
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:51.520]  Because I'll like you know force fights that like my teammate would have to play well in as well to win
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.280]  And uh, I'll make a mistake or they'll make a mistake and we'll just lose the game off it
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:58.000]  And it's not a good play style
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:01.760]  Right, it's not a good play style
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:06.560]  That's just like something that like I know other people probably also have
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:11.520]  And I'm telling you that like if you want to climb you got to get out of that mindset and get into the mindset of like
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:14.800]  consistency
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:20.240]  because you can see last game for example, I just straight up like
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.960]  lost the game off of me
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:29.200]  Trying to fight when my support didn't know how to fight or want to fight and we lost the game off it
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:37.040]  Like I was too aggro and even though if they did play correctly we win they didn't so we lost
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:39.920]  So it's basically like it's just not like a good, uh
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:43.040]  It's not a good, uh
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.880]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:47.120]  strategy
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.320]  Because last game was my fault
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:56.160]  Because I'm
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:00.080]  Good enough at the game that I know that I can't play like that if I want to be consistent
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:02.720]  And I still point like it. So it's my bad
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:10.960]  All right, what are we playing this game boys? We got Rengar karma jinn
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:15.360]  What do people want to see let me see if any of the ad carries people want to see if I could play these
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:22.080]  I can't play vain into this the vain would be way too hard in the karma jinn. I would just get zoned off the wave
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:35.280]  I could play a phallios this is actually a good a phallios game
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:37.920]  You
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.040]  Know what kind of sucks I feel kind of bad playing a phallios
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:45.760]  When I'm on my like teaching accounts
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:48.240]  Like this account I like teach you guys
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:50.320]  I feel bad playing a phallios sometimes
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:56.400]  Uh, because I know a lot of people don't want to learn a phallios or play a phallios
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:59.120]  Because he is like really
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:02.560]  He's very unique
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:08.160]  Like he's he's hard to learn for a lot of people. So I feel I always feel kind of bad doing it
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:11.280]  Right
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:15.520]  But I'll be real. I don't know in this specific situation outside of like jinx
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:19.200]  I didn't really know what else to pick
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:24.480]  Like jinx is good kaisa's probably okay, but you still get zoned off the wave on kaisa
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:26.640]  I
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.960]  Because like if we if we look at this right, uh
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.200]  Kaisa would have been
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:42.960]  I guess okay, but when you're picking a champion for bot lane, right
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:46.160]  When you're picking a champion for bot lane, uh
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:49.200]  One thing that you guys should think about when picking like what you you know
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:51.920]  What champion you want to play unless you're a one trick and then play whatever you want
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:57.600]  But if you're like somebody who wants to actually like play the meta and learn why champions are meta and when to pick what?
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:03.040]  They picked jin karma now
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:09.760]  We have a lulu if we had something with a hook like a nautilus a blitz a thresh a pike
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:13.120]  Like if we had something like that I could pick a low-range fighter
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:16.560]  Right like I could pick a low-range fighter if we had a hook champ
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.960]  But because we don't have a hook champ and we have a uh an enchanter
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:26.880]  I have to pick something that can safely consistently farm and not get zoned off by their bot lane
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:29.920]  So there's not a lot of options that can do that's
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:31.680]  There's like
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:34.320]  I didn't want to pick you could pick ezreal here. It's not the worst
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:37.280]  But we had a lulu so I didn't want to pick ezreal because lulu goes to waste
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:42.480]  So it's like you could pick jinx, but I kind of didn't want to pick jinx this game because jinx bores the shit out of me right now
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:44.800]  so, uh
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:48.800]  This would be a good jinx game though. If you guys are curious like this would be a completely fine jinx game
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:51.200]  Your e stops rangar jump
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:56.640]  Uh, you can follow up really easily with lulu like this would be a good jinx game
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.920]  um
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:03.840]  But a felios it's a good a felios game too. It's both. It's good a felios game good jinx game
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:06.560]  Um, it could be a good zerry game
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:09.040]  Zerry wouldn't be that bad here
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:12.160]  With lulu and against their comp. Uh, they're already squishy
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:15.600]  She's really mobile can get away from like rangar ganks pretty easily
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:19.600]  Tristana, I okay, so trist is unique because
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:23.760]  You only pick tristana if you plan on winning lane
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:25.840]  okay
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:27.840]  Tristana doesn't actually
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:30.320]  Scale better than jinx in any way
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:33.920]  Like she does not have a better scaling than jinx
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:39.840]  Trist trist vs jinx three items jinx wins every time in teamfights no matter what
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.880]  Like you she just does what trist does better
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:45.120]  um
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:49.440]  Now the reason you pick trist is because you do want to win lane you want to like jump in you want to kill them
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:53.280]  You want to be aggressive right so that's what you're picking trist for so i get kills in lane
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:51:00.960]  The problem is is again what we were just talking about right? Let's say I picked trist to get kills in lane now. Let's say my uh, my
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:06.000]  Support doesn't want to be aggressive and let's say like the jane and the karma have a really good push
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:13.680]  Okay, something that trist is really weak at is being pushed in right that's one of her weakest things because she has she struggles
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:17.040]  Especially early game. She struggles quite a bit on farming under turret
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:19.040]  so
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:20.880]  let's say
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:26.640]  It's just like a coin flippy pick you could pick trist if you had like a support duo for sure
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:31.440]  Into into jinn trist is amazing into jinn. It's one of jinn's hardest actual counters
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.040]  But again
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:38.640]  It's not about countering the champion is about countering the lane and what the lane is going to do to you and being able to play around that
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:45.360]  And this lane is a shove lane jinn karma doesn't fight you they poke you and shove waves in that's what they do
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.720]  They're a prio win
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:50.960]  So they're just going to shove and shove and shove right so because they're just going to shove and shove and shove
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:55.920]  I need to play something that isn't going to have issues playing under turret or something that can shove back if I need to
[01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:59.840]  Right, which is why jinx a failure. So both good
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.320]  Israel again would just get shoved in stuff like that
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:08.960]  Right. Oh, yeah, these are things you actually have to think about when you're playing the game
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:10.960]  for certain
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:12.480]  champions
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:14.880]  In certain matchups because a lot of the time
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:21.520]  People will pick a champion that's meta and they won't understand why they're still losing the matchup even though they're good at that champion
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:27.440]  And it's just that you're not bad at the champ. The matchup is just unplayable. You could put faker
[01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:33.200]  Double lift fucking goomy assi in certain matchups and they will just lose they will lose the matchups
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:35.920]  And it's because no matter how good your mechanics are
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:39.280]  If the matchup is played correctly, it doesn't it's not winnable
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:43.840]  And that's why you see in pro play drafting is so important
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:47.520]  It's perfect example of why in pro play drafting is 10 times more important than solo queue
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:50.800]  And it's because when everybody plays the matchups correctly and shit, right?
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:54.880]  When everybody's playing the matchups correctly and shits
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:59.280]  The matchup like skill becomes a thousand times more important
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:06.800]  Or like, you know how the matchups being play like the champions become way more important. Whoa, what the fuck?
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:10.160]  I'm on there. Just fuck them. What the hell is going on?
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:18.880]  Uh another little tip for you guys. Oh, I fucked that but another little tip for you guys is
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:24.560]  Melee champions or melee minions take
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:31.840]  One turret shot two autos
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:37.040]  Or sorry two turrets shots one auto and casters take one auto one turret shot
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:41.120]  When you're under turrets like luck, okay, so
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:46.160]  Learning this will be actually a pretty good game to explain to you how to farm under the turret actually
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:50.240]  I was thinking about like what I could teach you guys because we're just getting shoved in a lot this game
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  It's actually not that bad though
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:06.160]  Uh, so right now we could actually space forward here. Okay, that did not hit me. That was bs, but sure
[01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:19.120]  I did the same thing I did last game man
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:22.800]  I did the same thing you said I walked up
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:26.720]  It wasn't it was a good fight, but again
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:32.240]  I keep doing that or like I see the fight and I'll take the fight because I know it's a good fight
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:36.000]  But Lulu was too far back. So I ended up just inting
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:40.320]  It's really stupid
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:43.680]  Like that was such a dumb play by me
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:59.680]  Because I had to blow up both my sums right there because uh
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:05.360]  The gin or I mean the gin was in a really bad spot and the karma was in a really bad spot because I was level
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:08.160]  Three and they were level two and they were walking up to contest waves
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:10.160]  but
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:16.560]  My uh, Lulu was behind me and when you're playing, you know, solo queue you have to play as a team with your teammate
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:19.520]  Okay, so this gin is kind of griefing right now
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:29.120]  He's griefing by like walking up when I'm blue gunning him
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:38.640]  I don't know what Lulu's doing. I'm just killing that guy nice. Yeah, they're they're griefing really hard
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:40.640]  So the blue guns op for what you just saw
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:45.680]  All you have to do with the blue gun if you really want to just like have a funny ass overpowered fucking
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:49.200]  When they're farming under the turret like that
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:51.760]  Just hit the minions
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.040]  Okay, we're getting ganked back up
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:13.360]  So I kind of did a cardinal sin there I would say like a sin of like I overstayed a bit I think
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:17.120]  Oh, okay, we'll fuck off dude
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:22.320]  That was greedy I should have backed out the turret but I didn't think karma was actually gonna do that
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:27.680]  But uh, I did overstay because you can see like this is the perfect example of why I overstayed so they stopped my back, right?
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:31.280]  I can give you guys a really good example of what just happens
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:36.240]  I overstayed and when I overstayed I didn't actually get anything out of it
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:39.520]  Like I got what you saw I just have extra gold for nothing
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:41.920]  So now I just have extra gold, right?
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:46.000]  And because I have extra gold the gin actually gets in that positive because they stopped my back
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:50.320]  So he gets a free plate here. I miss a cannon and even though I'm still up 10 cs
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:54.880]  It's like I could have been up 10 cs not given a plate and not
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:56.960]  missed a cannon
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:58.960]  So it's it's basically like
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:02.080]  It's interesting
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:06.720]  Should you get prio for your jungler every game? No, no, that's not important
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:11.680]  Some games prio is important
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.200]  It's very important some games, but you don't need to always be thinking about getting prio for your jungler
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:22.240]  That's not something you should be like thinking about like always, right? Like you think about it in terms of like timers
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:27.760]  That's important, but prio for jungler always is not like something you should be
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:31.120]  worrying about
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:39.040]  Because if you're perma shoving and you're like, oh, I have prio for my jungler, but then your jungler doesn't do anything
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.120]  Like having that prio if you don't have prio it doesn't do anything
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:50.640]  Like I'd rather hold the wave in like a certain spot. Oh my god, I suck
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:11.040]  I
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:27.520]  Mean it worked out I think if I was six I triple killed them there, but
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:31.120]  I think we actually
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:34.000]  I think we actually triple killed them too if will help to me but again
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:37.040]  You guys know what I'm gonna say I go back to the thing
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:41.040]  You know what I mean
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:44.160]  An ally has been slain
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:11.040]  I
[01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:22.160]  Don't know if Rengar has ulti or not
[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:28.480]  I want to shove this because uh
[01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:37.440]  Chill
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:41.280]  I
[01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:46.640]  Want to shove it in for a second and I really don't have anything to do so I'll just stand here
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:49.040]  You want to also be back backed?
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:54.000]  Uh, what's the tip for when you buy boots? I bought boots a failure so you can buy boots really early
[01:59:54.080 --> 02:00:00.000]  He's like he's a champion where the more attacks you do is actually very valuable and positioning on a failure
[02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:02.240]  So it's very important. It's kind of like um
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:07.360]  Some ad carries like you don't need boots really early like like with like jinx for example
[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:13.680]  I usually go free boots right or I go boots like after my kraken but with a ferrios
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:17.840]  Uh, I really like the early mobility the early trading
[02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:20.640]  stuff like that
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:31.040]  Okay, so always be watching the map too we see the Rengar's top right we can actually just straight fight these guys 2v2 right now
[02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:34.160]  Uh, what?
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:40.240]  Wait what?
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:45.840]  What's my lulu doing homie? What what are we he's ulting us?
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:01.520]  So you're saying helping the ad carry is bad got it
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:08.960]  I
[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:11.440]  Can't believe my lulu just walked away from me
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:15.760]  And just like watched like you work as a team
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:19.520]  This is something that I cannot stress enough
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:24.320]  Play as a team
[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:26.880]  When you play league of legends
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:30.400]  This tells me more than anything because this happens even in grandmaster
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:34.560]  I see teammates who will be selfish and not help each other
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:37.520]  Just help each other
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:40.960]  Help each other please man. We are a team
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:46.720]  Don't just run and leave your adc
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:52.320]  Like i'm not even flaming you but like dude you can't do that
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:59.040]  You can't be upset that like like I can't dodge every spell welcome to the league
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:02.080]  I feel like something that I noticed that happens a lot in league now
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:09.280]  This is players will have this weirdly high expectation for everyone to play absolutely perfect at all times
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:14.400]  And and they want me to like be goomy assi and i'm like dude
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:18.400]  I dodged two of the gin bullets. I dodged a karma queue
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:24.340]  Like you literally like I can't dodge literally everything while slowed right like that's not how it works
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:35.460]  Like dude I'm gonna lose my mind with this guy
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:07.920]  My lulu is blaming me
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:14.240]  It's okay
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:23.920]  It's okay. I don't need to be upset. It's fine the lulu player is totally okay
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:26.080]  Okay
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:36.400]  You know sometimes people think they're right it's just what happens in the worlds
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:48.240]  Right it's just it is what it is no big deal
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:56.640]  Sorry
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:07.440]  Sorry, I'm trying really hard to not be an asshole right now this lulu player is making me like
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:12.160]  Making me want to like fund Thanos. You know what I mean? Like this guy is like making me
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:15.520]  Like this guy like we talk about
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:19.040]  We like in league we talk about like the players
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:22.080]  Like we talk about adc players having ego
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:25.120]  I genuinely think
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:31.360]  Support players have five times the ego adc players have but with like a third of the skill
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:37.760]  I think adc players do have massive egos
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:42.400]  But again, I don't think that like
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:47.600]  I think support players are genuinely the dumbest motherfucking humans on the planet
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:52.960]  And they think that they're the best players to ever touch the game and it hurts my fucking balls
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:17.200]  Hey lulu
[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:20.000]  Would you be willing to have a
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:23.520]  Vod review
[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:25.920]  With me in discord after the game
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:29.920]  Let's just see I want to see if like this person is willing to listen to reason
[02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:34.080]  Let's see
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:59.520]  I'm trying to not tilt but it's really frustrating
[02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:03.760]  Because this player is playing specifically for kda
[02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:11.280]  And they're playing like they don't understand how like I can already tell you if I go look at this person's op.g
[02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:14.880]  They only play for kda. I can tell you right now right here
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:19.360]  This person plays only for kda never takes any risks
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:24.240]  Doesn't ever help their ad carry ever when they get behind doesn't ever walk up to like
[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:28.800]  Try and fight doesn't do any of that. I can tell you right now without even looking at their op.g
[02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:31.920]  From how this person plays that they have high kda's
[02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:34.480]  But really low win rate
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:36.880]  I
[02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:42.800]  But I don't want my entire stream to be bitching about this lulu so we'll try and focus on how to win from this position
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:47.920]  Because I'm sure you guys get shitty supports too. So we'll try and focus on how to win from the current position we're in
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:07:05.600]  Yeah, it doesn't get better. I mean I'll be honest with you my grandmaster supports on my main suck like
[02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:07.520]  It doesn't get better
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:13.120]  They get better like mechanically at the game right like the higher elo supports get better mechanically
[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:16.400]  But they get worse they don't get better when like
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:21.680]  It doesn't get better. It's always like you'll either have a really good support or you'll have somebody who sniffs glue
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.240]  All right, I'm just dead
[02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:35.360]  Or I'm not dead
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:49.280]  I
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:55.600]  Okay
[02:07:56.320 --> 02:08:03.440]  Uh, honestly our biggest issue here is I need to get bloodthirster asap once I get bt the game gets a lot easier
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:06.000]  We could kill this guy right now
[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:09.760]  If the lulu helps me we can actually just straight kill these guys
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:15.360]  Because I can ulti to heal myself right we have lulu ult. I have ult to heal myself and I'm strong
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:20.480]  She has ignite I have ult. I have everything right we could easily
[02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:24.080]  Kill that that tolya right there
[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:28.080]  I
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:30.080]  I
[02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:33.040]  Mean yeah, whatever man. This is what I'm talking about
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:44.720]  Again, are you willing to get into discord and vaude review? Yes or no?
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:55.120]  I mean I have to be honest with you
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:58.080]  I mean I have to be honest with you
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:03.120]  The reason this is frustrating is because as an adc player
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:06.000]  You want to be able to rely on your support right?
[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:11.440]  You want to be able to make plays go in fight and rely on your teammates because as an adc player
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:14.880]  Support an ad or like a duo right like you want to play it together
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:22.400]  No, no man. I'm not attacking you. I'm saying let's discord after
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:28.480]  You can explain your pov and I'll explain mine
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:42.160]  Maybe we can like improve this player like get them to be a better player and not ruin every game they play in
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:46.240]  Like that would be that would be the goat
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:54.400]  Like the app that did not hit me by the way that hip hop should be asked but
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:05.920]  I don't even understand
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:12.080]  Oh man
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:18.880]  This is the person's
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:23.600]  By the way, this is the person sobi.gg
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:30.320]  Average win rate 50% win rate like I said has really good kda's on all his champs
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:33.920]  But he doesn't win
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:36.880]  I'm telling you right now
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:40.960]  The biggest thing in league that the fakest thing in league of legends
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:44.640]  Is believing that you are a good player based on kda
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:49.280]  If I go look at any challenger level support player right now
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:52.160]  Their kda's will be like
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:54.480]  four
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:58.000]  They'll still have good kda, but it'll be like four and three and it'll be on
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:01.360]  That's your mutual
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:03.360]  I'm gonna be real with you right now t
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.840]  This lulu player
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:08.240]  Like I you could tell me that this person
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:12.880]  Sniffed glue as a kid and their parents never told them to stop and I would believe you
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:15.840]  I'm not even meaning like I would say that makes sense
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:20.480]  I mean like I said, I don't I don't even care. I don't care if it's a girl a guy
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:24.720]  The e-girl thing is like that doesn't bother me right like it could be a girl a guy a pigeon
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:27.040]  They could they could fucking
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:32.960]  They could relate as a fucking peanut in a in a fucking plane. I don't care about that at all
[02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:38.240]  You don't mean like say that shit doesn't bother me at all
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:43.680]  Like them like I actually think it's stupid when people are like, oh, it's an e-girl e-guy like
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:46.400]  I think that's dumb as shit
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:48.400]  Because that argument's so crap
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:51.680]  Because like I don't give a shit if it's a guy or girl because like, you know what I mean
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:55.040]  I'm more upset at the fact that this person is delusional than anything
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:58.080]  That's like what's tilting me
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:12.640]  Here I'm just gonna mute we'll do one more game on this account after this game
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:15.760]  And I'm gonna mute from the start of the game for you guys, okay
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:25.200]  Dude if he didn't actually get me into the wall there
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:29.520]  I tried to walk forward so that I wouldn't get condemned into wall if he didn't stun me I kill him
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:32.240]  Ah, that's annoying
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:36.080]  That was actually such a good hitbox for him my bad
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:40.240]  Nice
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:52.880]  Huge shut down nice job
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:55.680]  If you're wondering why I'm even here by the way, I'm actually I'm not trolling
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:13:01.520]  I'm trying to get this turret because this gives me a lot of gold at the moment. I'm not actually worth that much gold
[02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:04.720]  There's nothing going on on the map. There's no objective or anything like that, right?
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:07.840]  So I'm trying to push in top waves right now so that I can get gold
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:12.400]  Uh to try and like hyper inflate my two item before this next dragon
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:17.200]  Because this next dragon is going to be incredibly important if we if we want any chance to win
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:20.320]  We have to win this next dragon
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:23.680]  And the only way for me to do that is to either get really lucky
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:27.040]  Or go get some gold in a side win
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:30.240]  It's just support difference every game it is
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:35.280]  I want to point this out. This person is playing this victim complex bullshit
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:38.340]  Like you know what I mean, but it is it is actually support death
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:03.040]  So
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:17.520]  I'm tilted I'm playing bad this game
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:21.760]  I need to mute these players because these players are actually tilting me
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:26.880]  Like I was fine with it before but I'm actually getting a little irritated. That's made me play bad
[02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:30.000]  So I need to mute them so I don't keep inting
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:34.960]  Like it's affecting my gameplay and it's it's pissing me off
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:39.120]  That's just my bad
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  T split are you here T?
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:50.800]  Yo T message this Lulu
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:54.640]  I mean this in the nicest way. I don't even want to be toxic
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:57.440]  I genuinely want to use this for content
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:05.920]  Like this guy's been flaming me the whole game like I want to use this for content to show you guys that
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:09.440]  It is so easy to tell people how the game should be played
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:13.200]  So easy if you if you can communicate by talking
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:22.240]  Because this guy's been doing nothing but flaming me the entire game this little right, but he's an absolute
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:27.520]  Like he played the lane completely bad then he then he stopped trying to win
[02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:31.360]  Stop shielding me stop doing anything right after he played the lane bad
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:38.400]  Then he started playing the victim thing when I asked him to be a human and like come over and like help me and play teamwork
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:40.880]  You gotta remember I didn't flame him a single time
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:44.720]  Right like I didn't say a single negative thing to this guy in game. I said let's work as a team
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:47.520]  He got upset
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:56.800]  Like I genuinely think it'd be great content if I could talk to this guy on discord and just like oh, I'd be so good
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:16.960]  Like dude, I'm I'm trying to kill these people guys
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:24.320]  That wasn't bad though. We got 800 golden not the worst, but I don't know if my team can stall this
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:27.280]  Maybe if they can like kill this they can stall it, but
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:35.920]  No, they're yeah, that's that's gg that was a disgusting tolly at w
[02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:49.520]  I
[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:51.520]  I
[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:18.080]  I'm gonna add him and he'll probably not add me but I might as well try
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:22.880]  This would be such a good learning experience
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:36.640]  Oh, excuse me dude, I've had like bad heartburn today. I need to take one of those heartburn pills
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:46.960]  What what what man just say just let it out let it out
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:53.200]  Let it out baby. Yo, we'll do
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:57.280]  Let's just just have a talk
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:07.760]  Yo, let's discord we can bother of you since I'm so bad
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:12.880]  Yo
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:19.360]  Trust
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:23.760]  You you just
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:32.000]  Blamed everyone by yourself, but you didn't play correctly at all
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:40.640]  You played lane completely wrong didn't help each other
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:45.200]  Left people to die on repeats
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:49.040]  Then played victim
[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:51.520]  You
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:01.440]  I genuinely want to help you
[02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:21.920]  You
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:33.840]  This guy screenshotted what I just said and put it in the the endgame chat
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:46.400]  What is happening right now what is going on
[02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:51.760]  There is no way that this is not an NPC
[02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:07.920]  There is no way this is not an NPC there's no way there's no way
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:10.400]  It's
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:23.680]  It's Geronimo the mouth it is me. Yes, bro just come talk in discord. I'm not even gonna flame you
[02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:32.080]  What does this even mean
[02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:38.960]  Bro, I don't think I've seen anybody more insecure in my life
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:47.760]  Bro you are so insecure it's cringe how insecure you are
[02:20:51.040 --> 02:21:00.720]  Like oof good luck man on the climb to masters but Jesus christ
[02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:04.800]  That's sad
[02:21:06.640 --> 02:21:08.240]  Oh
[02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:10.000]  God I
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.240]  Dude, I don't even know what to say like I'm gonna be real
[02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:17.120]  I was like I'm not even gonna flame the guy right I just genuinely want to like
[02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:19.920]  improve the community
[02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:24.880]  Because that was three straight supports in a row. They didn't know how to play lulu
[02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:30.560]  And I'm not even gonna flame the guy's skill. He's not a lulu player right? He doesn't play lulu. That's fine
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:35.200]  But the issue was that I had with that guy specifically was that
[02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000]  It's okay to be bad at the game
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:39.120]  Right
[02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:41.680]  There's nothing wrong with being bad at league everybody has bad games
[02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:46.000]  But when we're playing a game together and you're saying it's winnable and you want to win the game
[02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:48.400]  You can't pick and choose
[02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:50.960]  Who to like help win the game
[02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:59.200]  Like if I'm sitting there bot lane, we're both being dove by jinn and you're intentionally trying not to take damage and not die
[02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:01.760]  Because you want to value your kda
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:04.080]  over everything else
[02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:06.880]  So that I you know what hold on let me think about this
[02:22:08.480 --> 02:22:10.480]  I think I figured this person out
[02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:14.400]  This person lives in delusion and I think I figured this out
[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:19.120]  Let me let me explain this a lot of players do this, but I think I'm figuring this out as I'm as I'm thinking about this
[02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:22.160]  so
[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:26.080]  This person has really good kda's on their profile right this like this eye catching person
[02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:28.400]  They've really really good kda's on their profile right?
[02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:33.440]  This person doesn't ever take risks doesn't ever do anything
[02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:37.840]  To try and win the game outside of like just like existing and hitting buttons
[02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:43.760]  And what they do is they will always have good kda's
[02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:47.840]  And they will they will sit here and never like I know why they're losing
[02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:53.280]  They will sit here and they will do this shit where they have good kda's. They they don't ever die that much blah blah blah
[02:22:54.080 --> 02:22:58.560]  But what they do is they lie to themselves and they say look how good my kda's are
[02:22:59.360 --> 02:23:01.440]  If I had better teammates, I'd always win
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:08.000]  Like I cracked the code actually
[02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:12.080]  That's totally what it is the players actually like
[02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:18.640]  Play so safe and they play to like for statistics right they play like purely for the stats
[02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:24.560]  And then they can say that it was their team's fault that they didn't win because they played
[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:27.360]  Really bad, but they didn't die
[02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:35.600]  Because I mean in theory I could have a perfect kda on every ad carry I play
[02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:42.240]  Right all I'd have to do is literally walk walk up get one kill and then afk and stand in the base the rest of the game
[02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:46.880]  And I could be like yo, why is my team not able to carry what's happening?
[02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:54.960]  Right like you could literally do that. No, I seriously think the person's self gaslighting himself
[02:23:55.520 --> 02:24:00.720]  Like I'm serious. I think this person's like self gaslighting where they they're like, oh, it's my team's fault every game
[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:05.200]  Right like they're always blaming their team for their their their loses and their mistakes and shit
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:07.520]  And it's sad because like
[02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:10.240]  There's a reason you're d2 and I'm not saying that to be toxic
[02:24:10.240 --> 02:24:12.720]  I'm saying that like you haven't improved in four years
[02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:16.560]  And you haven't improved because all you're doing is playing to blame your team every single game
[02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:21.840]  When I just saw like 500 mistakes that you made that we could have won the game off of early game
[02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:26.560]  Here I remember somebody wanted me to play a Caitlyn game last game. So we're gonna play Cait
[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:30.880]  I don't remember. I don't remember who it was in the chat somebody's like two people said Cait
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:33.280]  But we'll do a cake game for you guys
[02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:35.920]  I got your voice. Don't worry
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:40.880]  I
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:42.880]  I
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:44.880]  I
[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:46.880]  I
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:48.880]  I
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:50.880]  I
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:52.880]  I
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:54.880]  I
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:56.880]  I
[02:24:56.880 --> 02:24:58.880]  I
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:00.880]  I
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:02.880]  I
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:04.880]  I'm gonna take
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:11.360]  Ghost flash because they have three melee champs four melee champs. They have they have recons ed clad gregis. So I'm gonna take ghostflash
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:15.120]  These are gonna be my runes this game
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:18.160]  I'm gonna take a little more mr because I don't think we're gonna be fighting too much in lane
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:20.560]  We're pretty much just gonna be poking them
[02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:22.400]  with karma kate
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:26.080]  So I'm gonna take a little bit extra mr because I'm gonna be playing for mid delay game. I'm just scaling
[02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:29.760]  And these are gonna be the runes that I take
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:39.680]  Even classed on adc or the easier to play ones
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:45.200]  In adc, uh, I usually do like when I'm playing on this account right now. This is like my teaching account
[02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:50.400]  It's a little lower mmr right. It's like d1 low masters. I usually uh
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:57.120]  Play ad carries that like the chat wants to see me play so that you guys can learn like good and bad matchups and things like that
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:02.800]  The last two games I got way too tilted by sheddy support players
[02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:06.960]  Like egos and all that shit. I got way too frustrated and I played bad the last two games
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:09.200]  so we're gonna
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:11.760]  Honestly, I'm just I think I'm just gonna mute these people at the very start of the game
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:17.360]  Normally, I wouldn't suggest you mute people because like playing as a team is really important
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:22.160]  Uh, because like, you know, you need to communicate and all that shit, but I am just like I'm gonna mute them
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:29.600]  Because I I dude my mental is taking a fucking hit right now. So we're gonna just chill and play
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:38.320]  I I just don't know how to play nile. I think that was really good. I just don't I don't know how to play her
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:42.080]  I think she's a great champ
[02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:46.480]  Like I've been getting shit on by nile on my main account
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.240]  Like a lot of grandmaster nyla's have been dumpstering me
[02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:02.640]  I think she's just really good at abusing solo queue
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:05.760]  Like the the issue with nyla
[02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:08.320]  Is from what I've seen all the losses I've had with nyla
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:12.080]  People don't um, it's like the thing I was telling you about before
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:15.040]  people don't play aggressively
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:21.040]  In the lower elos like even in grandmaster people don't play like aggressively enough. It sounds crazy to say that but it's true
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:23.200]  They don't play aggressively enough in lane
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:28.160]  So you can get away with just picking nyla and scaling and nyla at like one item
[02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:30.720]  You'll always be up in levels right because that's how the champion works
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:35.600]  The champion works and like you'll always be up in levels because of her passive so
[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:42.720]  You basically just like scale through existing it's pretty it's pretty interesting
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:45.920]  I'm on the job. All right, so we're playing cake karma
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:50.960]  Oh, I missed the minion because I suck
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:53.600]  I'm gonna ward this bush
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:56.560]  Uh, just because I don't want the recon in the bush
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:09.840]  So now that the bush isn't ward anymore, um, okay, what are the nice I was gonna say what I want to do is I actually want to play
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:11.920]  Oh
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:13.440]  I suck
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:15.680]  I actually wanted to play. Oh man. I'm so bad at kate
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:20.480]  I wanted to play on the top side of the wave so that I'm not standing near the bushes, right?
[02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:23.120]  Because if you stand near the bushes
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:28.240]  The recon can obviously like w me and I just get fucked so I'd rather play in a safer spot
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:31.600]  I can't believe I missed 2cs. I'm so fucking bad
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:36.720]  Now I want to push in wave three and I want to go buy a call so I'm gonna ping to push
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:42.640]  Okay
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:51.840]  So I actually want to back here and I'm gonna go buy a call so this is called a cheetah recall
[02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:57.200]  You usually have perfect cs to back on this timer
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:00.080]  Go and you can go buy a call. Okay
[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:04.320]  This is like something that you can do if you're in a lane that's going to be perma shoving
[02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:06.720]  So what happens is the reason it's called the cheetah recall
[02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:13.120]  Is because we push the wave in they had to stay and farm the wave, right now watch
[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:21.360]  They have to push this wave in right now if karma was here instead of roaming this roam is fine by the way
[02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:24.160]  But if she was here instead of roaming she could actually hold the wave
[02:29:25.440 --> 02:29:30.240]  And if you notice here, I don't actually miss that many minions, right? We're chilling
[02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:38.960]  Now we can slow push this we're safe I should actually fast push this
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:47.920]  Because I wanted to bounce I don't want to slow push this but I can't uh, I can't fast push this at level three by myself
[02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:54.560]  So we're just gonna chill
[02:29:54.720 --> 02:29:57.760]  Kaelin's really good at abusing like early lane phase
[02:29:58.320 --> 02:30:03.520]  Bullying just based on like what our kit does we see rakan on the map top side. You get you see that's
[02:30:04.720 --> 02:30:06.720]  So because we see rakan
[02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:11.200]  I can walk up a bit and we could play a little aggro here
[02:30:17.920 --> 02:30:22.240]  You can kind of see like I don't have to play behind the minion wave you see what I'm doing to this guy, right?
[02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:26.400]  I hate this game we can quit we can we can forfeit. It's fun
[02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:31.680]  I hate this game
[02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:34.080]  No more cat and mouse. I really hate this game
[02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:37.840]  Dude, what is wrong with me right now? It's like my brain doesn't work
[02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:42.800]  It's the 280 k nerf telling you
[02:30:47.520 --> 02:30:49.520]  So rakan's gonna be bot right now
[02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:56.320]  I know he's gonna be bot so I need to be a little care now my karma is here
[02:30:59.200 --> 02:31:02.320]  There we go, so you notice I didn't use any spells. I'm not I'm just chilling
[02:31:05.840 --> 02:31:08.400]  Dude are you kidding me man?
[02:31:10.960 --> 02:31:14.240]  I'm gonna be honest. I'm getting really tilted by these players now
[02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:16.960]  Like the rakan w's in
[02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:20.080]  They just stand there and watch me die
[02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:25.520]  Okay, it's fine. Listen. I'm not gonna get too mad about it. It's fine. I should have flashed the knockup
[02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:29.120]  I guess even though in reality I should never have to flash the knockup
[02:31:29.600 --> 02:31:32.240]  But I I should have flashed it because I can't trust the teammates
[02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:36.720]  So what I'm saying is right there karma and fiddle were both right here. I was being chased down
[02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:41.520]  They they stood here. They didn't they didn't walk up to do anything. They just stood and waited
[02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:45.440]  That pisses me off because I hate when players
[02:31:46.640 --> 02:31:48.320]  play
[02:31:48.320 --> 02:31:50.960]  Selfish and scared. It's my biggest pet peeve
[02:31:53.920 --> 02:31:58.800]  It drives me fucking crazy man, sorry, I'm getting I'm losing my mind
[02:32:02.800 --> 02:32:04.800]  Like it's so easy
[02:32:06.400 --> 02:32:09.760]  It's fine though. I shouldn't have walked up an ego did it's on me
[02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:13.520]  I
[02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:23.520]  Want to soul push this wave
[02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:30.880]  I'm losing it
[02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:38.080]  This by the way would be an example of a bad time for karma to run she needs to come back bought
[02:32:42.160 --> 02:32:44.160]  There's absolutely no reason for her to roam on that timer
[02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:49.760]  There's also no reason for her to be in that bush over there. We should be playing up to try we're playing k karma, right?
[02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:52.720]  We should be playing forward so that we can actually be aggressive
[02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:55.200]  k karma's a lane bully lane
[02:32:55.200 --> 02:32:59.120]  We don't want to sit here and just do nothing if you pick karma you want to be aggressive
[02:32:59.120 --> 02:33:02.960]  You want to be playing up you want to be stunning you want to be doing like aggressive things playing the game
[02:33:06.400 --> 02:33:08.960]  We're level six I'd really like to like go in yeah like
[02:33:12.080 --> 02:33:14.080]  I
[02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:22.080]  That was actually not bad by the karma she w'd the zaya and then I got to trap off of it. So that wasn't too bad
[02:33:23.600 --> 02:33:25.600]  Not the worst
[02:33:25.600 --> 02:33:29.600]  Not not bad
[02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:45.840]  That was good that was good really nice really nice. Okay, so I'm gonna back here because I don't want to overstay for the wave
[02:33:55.600 --> 02:33:57.600]  I
[02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:05.120]  Got boots
[02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:09.920]  You don't think a lot of it is too
[02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:14.800]  I think a lot of it is people get really scared when they like rakan is really strong in this meta, right?
[02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:16.240]  Like he's very very powerful
[02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:20.400]  He's he's like numbers are a little too high right now. So like everything he does is just a little too good
[02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:23.520]  So I think people get nervous around rakan especially with zaya
[02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:28.400]  Because it's like when people would get nervous around non-milution the lane like plays itself. It's very strong
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:29.840]  It's very hard to beat
[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:33.760]  But you can still see people making mistakes when they play the lane. So you got to watch for that type of stuff
[02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:43.440]  Now a good way to play against a zaya once you hit six
[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:49.760]  Is you don't want to
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:56.160]  You don't want to ever walk melee range of her or give her the ability to just kill you with the feathers
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:34:58.880]  Your main goal here is going to be
[02:34:59.040 --> 02:35:01.040]  Try and stay in a good spot when it comes to
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:04.160]  Feathers like I want to be to the side of her
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:08.640]  The side of her is the best option like where she can't pull in like I'll get hit by maybe a few
[02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:11.040]  But she can't pull in all of them
[02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:14.320]  That's a really
[02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:17.600]  Key thing when playing versus her because I remember back in the day
[02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:20.320]  I didn't know how to play for zaya and I would always get fucking frustrated as shit
[02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:24.000]  So rakan's five. I want to hit tab see rakan's five
[02:35:25.280 --> 02:35:27.280]  We shouldn't be able to die here
[02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:33.920]  I want to push this wave in but I also need to stay away from where the rakan could be
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.320]  So if you want to push waves in and reset the wave
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:44.000]  Make sure that you're standing as far away as you can from where they can engage on you
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:47.280]  Is
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:53.760]  Now they're about to be six rakan is so they have a really strong level six. She has pickaxe and noon quiver
[02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:56.800]  We do want to be a little hesitant here. We don't want to fight
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:00.720]  Now I'm gonna kind of push this in a bit
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:07.120]  We should have been spam pushing the whole wave because that's how k karma plays. We just push push push push
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:11.360]  But we played uh that that early roam by karma
[02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:14.240]  Uh kind of put us behind on that
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:19.440]  It's not a big deal. It's just something that we have to adjust
[02:36:23.120 --> 02:36:25.680]  Why does this say 88 and this say 90?
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:30.080]  Which one is it?
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:39.920]  Is it 88 or 90?
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:43.440]  I
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:51.840]  Mean I got dead. I don't know what that karma's thinking but
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:56.640]  Uh, we probably have to give this drake
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:04.880]  I mean, maybe we could fight it if fiddle had ulti but him not having ult. Yeah, there's no way
[02:37:04.960 --> 02:37:06.960]  I
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:14.000]  The higher one counts ward kills why?
[02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:19.120]  I think that's so stupid. So they might try and engage here
[02:37:21.040 --> 02:37:26.160]  Unless they somehow know fiddles in the bush, which would be impressive because we know it's not warded
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:30.400]  So that'd be pretty impressive if they knew that
[02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:45.600]  We could actually refs
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:53.920]  I'm just gonna ghost
[02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:01.040]  This is crazy what the fuck oh, this is interesting
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:10.160]  They saw fed 100% yeah, I don't know where though it must have because he used this thing
[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:13.760]  It'll use his uh, whatever it's called
[02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:18.240]  His effigy I'd have to go look
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:24.400]  One million oh, I guess I didn't see it
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:28.240]  Uh, I should back I can get dove here
[02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:32.400]  We don't know where gragas is like if gragas happens to be like he ease over this wall or something
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:36.000]  I think it don't really easy. I'm greeting really hard
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:39.200]  Greeting usually gets you killed
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:40.800]  typically
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:42.800]  I shouldn't be doing this
[02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:48.880]  They're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right? It's like
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:52.640]  If you know something it's gonna be a bad habit you should not do it
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:57.440]  Just cue the bush
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:00.240]  Okay, that was I meant use like an actual cue
[02:39:03.280 --> 02:39:06.160]  They could also be in the alcove so I'm a little hesitant, but it's fine
[02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:16.240]  Okay, so the reason I stayed was because now I have my uh, I have my mythic right
[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:21.040]  Because we we finished the coal and we finished the mythic at the same time or finished the wave so
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:26.720]  Now I have two options I go gale force here, uh to dodge a lot of their shits
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:30.320]  Or I can do what sounds like a fun option
[02:39:30.880 --> 02:39:32.880]  We're gonna do shield though
[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:37.040]  I'm gonna show you guys why I like shield bow on Caitlyn
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:40.240]  It's not the best mythic
[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:42.240]  But it's good into certain comps
[02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:45.920]  If you don't want to get uh
[02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:49.760]  Gale
[02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:55.040]  Because I have a lacquer to this game. I don't have bloodline, right? So I kind of want to go shield bow
[02:40:00.640 --> 02:40:04.400]  And then I'm gonna end up going either ie or I'm gonna end up going
[02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:17.680]  Like bloodthirster seconds ie or bt probably ie just because uh, I think I think it's actually easier to go ie this game
[02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:28.400]  But yeah, this is a kind of boring game our team's doing really well though, so we just chill
[02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:39.120]  We got to be a little care, okay
[02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:57.680]  It was kind of hard to do anything there
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:02.160]  Even though I got like a few autos on the gregas. It's a little difficult to actually play the game there
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:12.640]  Because if I walk up too far like see we're cons there if I walk up too far I just get uh killed by rakan
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:17.200]  All right, I'm just gonna reset and go get boots
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:22.080]  Typically any carry is really fucking boring
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:24.800]  uh in games like this
[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:27.520]  where
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:29.520]  You can't really blow the game open
[02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:37.280]  Oh, I'm dead maybe wait karma shield me. I'm not dead
[02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:42.320]  Nice
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:41:59.920]  I
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:04.320]  Motherfucker co-read me man. Here's it's like goby
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:08.880]  We can fight this though. They have no ults
[02:42:14.400 --> 02:42:18.080]  Like this is actually fightable they have no xayah and no uh draggas are
[02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:26.080]  And this is also why it's really important that you relate to your team the cooldowns of your team
[02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:29.760]  Remember that don't forget that if somebody uses a big cooldown
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:36.640]  Tell your team because that was an illegal dragon, right? Like they just that was one of the most illegal things. I've seen in a while
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:39.040]  homie
[02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:41.040]  completely grieved that
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:43:03.920]  That's another very very very important thing that you need to take away from playing league and being like this is what I was saying about
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:05.920]  the teamwork and shit earlier
[02:43:06.480 --> 02:43:09.760]  Being good at the game is a lot of spreading knowledge as well, right?
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:15.920]  Like if you if your team doesn't know if a flash is up or down you have to play completely differently, right?
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:18.640]  Like you got to think about the game in that in terms of that as well
[02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:20.640]  Like how many times have you seen like
[02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:24.160]  You know, you're like, oh, I can walk up here if this guy can't flash ult me or something, right?
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:28.960]  It happens all the time
[02:43:32.400 --> 02:43:34.880]  I wonder if I can kill a duskblade zed. I don't know
[02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:42.160]  I probably could
[02:43:50.960 --> 02:43:52.960]  Uh, I should go mad
[02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:58.320]  What do you think about team oh and other top lane as ad carry?
[02:44:00.320 --> 02:44:04.960]  I play team oh ad carry when I'm playing for fun sometimes. It's okay
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:10.880]  Fuck
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000]  Yo, go look on your game, man
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:20.240]  So during the mid game is Caitlyn a few things that I can kind of teach you
[02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:23.440]  This was kind of a boring lane phase, right? Like we didn't really do that much
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:29.120]  The lane phase was essentially just like we died once and then you know everything all hell broke was
[02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:32.160]  When you're walk up the fights like this
[02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:35.040]  Make sure that you're putting traps down in places
[02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:39.360]  Where the enemy has to walk
[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:45.920]  Just like that
[02:44:45.920 --> 02:44:50.080]  Playing 80 playing Caitlyn is not always about just like autoing and getting cues and shits
[02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:54.000]  If you noticed during that fight, I put two traps here two traps here
[02:44:54.400 --> 02:44:57.760]  I forced the enemy team into like a location where they had to eat traps
[02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:04.240]  Or they uh, they can't find us right and even if like
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:10.000]  They avoid the traps they're still having to like move their character
[02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:14.400]  In a very unique specific way that they probably don't want to do
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:21.280]  So you should always be thinking where should I put these traps down at the start of the fight?
[02:45:21.280 --> 02:45:24.560]  Not like how do I get autos off think about using your traps to zone
[02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:28.320]  And I like control the team fight before the fight starts rather than using it to
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:33.040]  Do damage because they'll step in the traps themselves
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:37.920]  People will just people are stupid. They're bad people aren't paying attention
[02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:40.640]  everything I'm bad
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:45.040]  You know what I mean people can't pay attention to every bush that you're putting traps in during a big fight
[02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:47.840]  It's it's too much attention span. Nobody has it
[02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:03.760]  Nice
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:06.160]  I'm gonna grab this red
[02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:10.000]  Oh big tip for all the 80 carries in chat guys
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:12.560]  I'm gonna tell you right now
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:14.560]  Once the 20 minute mark happens in league
[02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:17.200]  Your jungler's camps are no longer his
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:22.080]  I know I know junglers are gonna hate me for this. Okay. Listen if you're a jungle player
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:24.960]  You're like fuck this guy now. I hate him. Listen, you know, it's true
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:30.400]  You know at 20 minutes your camps no longer like they're not yours anymore, man. Okay
[02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:37.520]  Like you you you are full items at this point. Okay, like I want to be honest you would I'm taking your camps
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:42.960]  I'm trying to get my third item as fast as humanly possible
[02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:54.160]  Because 80 carries spike on three items extremely hard
[02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:04.560]  Man I want to walk top but we have no vision of this area so it's a little scary
[02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:10.720]  Like I said, I typically don't like to take
[02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:13.600]  jungles camps early game ever
[02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:15.360]  Because like
[02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:17.040]  Like that's why I say like at 20 minutes
[02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:21.680]  Usually you have two items at this point if you're like farming decent and you know, you know, etc
[02:47:22.240 --> 02:47:25.920]  Sometimes they'll be faster, but usually it's around average of like you'll have your items at this point
[02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:31.760]  Always be tabbing to the teamfights even if you're farming as well
[02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:46.560]  I
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:47:55.520]  Said is in this bush
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:06.720]  Wait, where is he wait, I'm stupid. Where'd he go? Oh, he died. I killed him. Wow. I'm really smart
[02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:09.040]  I
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:16.960]  Like didn't notice that I killed that guy. I'm so dumb
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:24.640]  80 carry brain right boys
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:31.280]  I was like playing that so scared too because I was like I was like easy there
[02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:39.600]  Is
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:43.200]  Pull the dragon out
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:48.800]  Oh, I asked this yesterday, but what do you guys think the coolest looking dragon is I swear it's the uh
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:52.320]  I think mountain drake looks fucking sick
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:08.720]  I
[02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:31.840]  Welcome to the here you saw that I like time to push man, right
[02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:36.480]  Uh, that's mainly because we our karma just got picked off
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:43.760]  And I don't want to give them the option of pushing the wave so by pushing the lane
[02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:00.800]  Hold on
[02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:07.520]  Nice by pushing the the lane in it takes away an option for the enemy
[02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:10.560]  That's something that a lot of people think like oh, I just want farm
[02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:14.960]  I don't care about the farm right like when I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game
[02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:17.200]  and I'm pushing like a
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:20.800]  Mid mid wave in before a fight if we're just sieging around the baron
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:26.640]  I having that wave pushed in gives them gives us another option. I'm like what we can do in the game
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:29.680]  And it takes you three seconds to push it in so
[02:50:29.680 --> 02:50:31.680]  If the fight's already over
[02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:37.200]  And you have time always be paying attention to like trying to push in waves
[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:42.720]  So that you can create a little bit of that pressure. Yo, hey, thank you so much for the 14 man. Welcome back
[02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:46.160]  What do I get next I kind of want to get bt?
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:49.200]  I'm gonna get bt
[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:54.080]  I could get doms, but I think bt's better because
[02:50:54.800 --> 02:50:59.120]  The uh, I already have over here right so the shield from bt plus shield bow plus ie
[02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:02.080]  I don't think I'll be able to die. Okay. I think I'm unkillable
[02:51:02.960 --> 02:51:04.960]  Act actually like actually unkillable
[02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:10.400]  So here I'm gonna actually give these camps the feddle because he's literally pathing to them. I don't want to be an asshole, but
[02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:28.960]  Wow what just happened I'm bad
[02:51:30.640 --> 02:51:32.880]  I feel like I got hooked by clad
[02:51:34.480 --> 02:51:36.480]  Oh, he flashed okay
[02:51:37.760 --> 02:51:40.080]  I was like I feel like what just happened was like I
[02:51:40.160 --> 02:51:44.960]  Mispositioned because like I went up here right like I ghosted one up here because there was two people here two people here
[02:51:45.280 --> 02:51:50.640]  I put traps down these kind of sloppy traps and then I positioned here and then clad flashed cued me under the yeah
[02:51:50.720 --> 02:51:52.720]  Okay, that makes sense
[02:51:52.720 --> 02:51:54.720]  I'm just bad
[02:51:56.080 --> 02:51:58.080]  It was okay though because
[02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:02.320]  If the entire enemy team has to literally
[02:52:05.440 --> 02:52:10.400]  Like double flash on you to kill you under the turret and then your team follows up. It's not that big of a deal
[02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:12.960]  Gale force would have saved me there though. Actually
[02:52:14.560 --> 02:52:16.560]  Low key
[02:52:16.960 --> 02:52:23.040]  Gale force totally gonna save me because he has serpents
[02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:30.160]  Serpents definitely shits on chilebo. I'm kind of stupid for going chilebo this game
[02:52:33.120 --> 02:52:38.880]  I wanted to try it out because I when I before when I was playing katlyn like before the eye reworking everything everybody would go
[02:52:40.080 --> 02:52:43.600]  Or there was like one guy in challenger would go shield bow into shit every game
[02:52:44.080 --> 02:52:48.960]  And I wanted to see if like it was still viable, but there might just be better options now like always scale force a
[02:52:49.840 --> 02:52:51.840]  bt or something
[02:52:54.640 --> 02:52:56.640]  Oh my god, I flashed late i'm dead
[02:52:59.280 --> 02:53:04.000]  Dude I flashed late for some reason i'm so dumb my bad
[02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:07.520]  I was giving an mb
[02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:09.520]  Like my brain is moving slowly
[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:12.240]  Like I can feel it turning
[02:53:12.960 --> 02:53:14.960]  I'm just playing bad
[02:53:14.960 --> 02:53:18.320]  Like I was baiting the clad to go in on me because karma was there
[02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:21.200]  But what I need to do is I need to trap on top myself when he goes in
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000]  Then I need to flash knit
[02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000]  And the clutch just dies
[02:53:27.200 --> 02:53:29.200]  You can also just kill him
[02:53:30.320 --> 02:53:32.560]  I was gonna say they have nothing
[02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:37.600]  We just play for dragon here
[02:53:42.320 --> 02:53:45.600]  I don't know why i'm playing so bad today. I played bad yesterday too. I don't know what's going on
[02:53:46.320 --> 02:53:48.320]  My like brain is broken
[02:54:05.280 --> 02:54:07.280]  Dude that recon was trying so hard
[02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:14.720]  I
[02:54:18.960 --> 02:54:20.960]  I'll make this quick
[02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:44.560]  Oh, I've made so many mistakes this game
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:52.320]  I fucked up positioning mechanics farm all kinds of shit
[02:54:59.440 --> 02:55:01.840]  Uh, I still don't want our doms actually
[02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:10.400]  I don't think Lord Dom's is good this game
[02:55:12.320 --> 02:55:15.200]  Like they have no armor like clad has murk treads
[02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:19.120]  Which I feel like
[02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:22.080]  Really bad indoor team, but
[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:33.280]  Uh, oh a little tip that you guys can have for katlyn too
[02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:36.240]  when you are
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:38.240]  Like baron's up in in 50 seconds, right?
[02:55:38.240 --> 02:55:43.360]  So a little thing you can do that's actually kind of fun is you want to be at the objective before the like
[02:55:43.920 --> 02:55:48.320]  Rule with them one of the objectives coming up. You always want to be on that side of the map before the before the objective comes up
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:51.280]  but
[02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:53.280]  You can put down traps, uh
[02:55:54.160 --> 02:55:56.160]  in the bushes
[02:55:56.160 --> 02:55:59.440]  Around the objectives and people will face check them and you can just one tap on the way game
[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:03.520]  It's actually incredibly fun
[02:56:04.480 --> 02:56:09.680]  Like you just put them in the corners of the bushes where people have to walk
[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:18.020]  Like right here I can put it right between the turret
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:31.840]  I don't know why I didn't ghost
[02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:34.240]  I'll be honest. I have no idea why I didn't ghost
[02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:39.360]  I was like saving it for something. I'm not sure what
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:45.040]  Next year a birthday present who the fuck knows
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:51.200]  Oh, I could have one shot that guy if I was better at kate
[02:56:53.040 --> 02:56:56.240]  I did a really classic combo right there. I just didn't queue because I'm bad
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:56:58.320]  I
[02:56:58.720 --> 02:57:01.760]  Should have when he hit the trap your two headshots sit on him for a few seconds
[02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:05.680]  So what I should have done is I should have instantly queued on top of the trap then auto auto and he would have died
[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:11.280]  Because your queue does the max damage when they're trapped too. So it would have been like, uh, just a perfect three shot
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:16.320]  But like I said, I don't play kate enough and my muscle memories kind of trash sometimes so
[02:57:17.840 --> 02:57:19.840]  That was my bad
[02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:33.280]  Oh, we're getting cluttered. I don't know where he is but
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:52.160]  Fuck I shouldn't have done that
[02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:54.480]  I
[02:57:55.040 --> 02:57:57.040]  I'm limit testing really hard right now
[02:57:57.280 --> 02:58:00.320]  I suggest you guys don't limit test. Well, actually, I do think you should limit test
[02:58:00.560 --> 02:58:04.080]  But not if you want to win like play safer like right there. The play wasn't to go back in
[02:58:04.640 --> 02:58:07.280]  The play was to like back off, but I wanted to see if I could like
[02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:12.240]  I wanted to see if I was terrible or not
[02:58:13.600 --> 02:58:15.120]  You know
[02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:17.120]  I was
[02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:23.840]  But yeah, I mean the combo with kate is like if they're trapped you want to queue while they're in the trap essentially because
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:28.720]  Your auto will always give you the range. So if you auto and then queue
[02:58:29.360 --> 02:58:31.360]  um
[02:58:31.440 --> 02:58:34.320]  When when they're trapped they get uh, not a lot of people know this
[02:58:34.880 --> 02:58:37.200]  Because I just found this out like a few years or like
[02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:40.080]  after I should have uh
[02:58:40.880 --> 02:58:42.880]  When you queue on top of a kate trap
[02:58:43.040 --> 02:58:49.280]  The way kate's queue works is when you queue the initial like it hits initially and then it does less damage to the targets behind it,right?
[02:58:50.480 --> 02:58:52.800]  It's very narrow and then it like it like gets bigger. So
[02:58:53.840 --> 02:58:55.680]  When they're trapped though
[02:58:55.680 --> 02:58:59.360]  It does the maximum queue damage that it can do in like the isolation of the queue
[02:58:59.840 --> 02:59:02.800]  So that's why when people are trapped you want to open up with your queue
[02:59:05.280 --> 02:59:08.800]  You either want to net into the queue and then double auto
[02:59:09.360 --> 02:59:12.080]  Or you want to net or you want to like you want to queue
[02:59:13.040 --> 02:59:15.840]  Then trap net at the same time then double auto
[02:59:16.240 --> 02:59:17.840]  You basically it's a very
[02:59:17.840 --> 02:59:21.360]  Interesting way to play you always want to try and overlay a trap on your trap
[02:59:21.920 --> 02:59:27.360]  So when they get trapped you can overlay a second trap to either in front of them or behind them
[02:59:27.680 --> 02:59:31.520]  And what will happen is there's actually like a little mini like I want to say one second
[02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:35.520]  Uh, cooldown of being able to be trapped right like a little 1.5 two second cooldown
[02:59:36.080 --> 02:59:39.760]  But what can happen is they sit in the trap then what you can do is your net can slow them
[02:59:40.160 --> 02:59:42.560]  So you can you can actually queue in the first trap
[02:59:42.880 --> 02:59:49.200]  Then you can drop a second trap net slow them into the second trap and then triple auto headshot them from all three of the net
[02:59:49.440 --> 02:59:50.880]  The two traps
[02:59:50.880 --> 02:59:52.880]  It's really complicated sounding
[02:59:56.880 --> 02:59:58.880]  But
[03:00:02.880 --> 03:00:06.320]  This man does redeemed end my stream whenever you want
[03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000]  I
[03:00:13.440 --> 03:00:15.440]  What
[03:00:17.120 --> 03:00:19.120]  Why
[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000]  Why would you want to end my stream right now?
[03:00:29.520 --> 03:00:31.520]  Why would you want to be that guy?
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000]  You
[03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:40.160]  Wow, okay
[03:00:50.160 --> 03:00:52.800]  Don't shit don't end just change the camera position
[03:00:54.400 --> 03:00:56.880]  Did you just spend 1 million points?
[03:00:57.200 --> 03:01:03.520]  To tell me to put the camera back on the right side of my fucking
[03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:13.760]  No way no way you just did that
[03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:20.400]  I was like this man is just flexing
[03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:25.520]  He's just like yeah, I got some points to spare. I guess I could like throw him, you know
[03:01:27.280 --> 03:01:29.280]  I
[03:01:29.280 --> 03:01:31.280]  Had fun
[03:01:41.680 --> 03:01:44.320]  There's that better is that better
[03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:53.360]  Drink water actually that's a good one. I'll be our be I'm gonna get some water
[03:01:53.760 --> 03:01:55.760]  I
[03:01:56.160 --> 03:01:59.120]  Should we plan our main I kind of want to try and hit GM
[03:02:00.160 --> 03:02:03.200]  Yeah, let's get on our main account. It's like 1 p.m. So it's like 3 p.m. Eastern
[03:02:04.080 --> 03:02:05.760]  I think
[03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:07.760]  I can get cues at the moments
[03:02:10.080 --> 03:02:14.400]  I'm gonna get some water and then we'll cue up or we'll cue up then get some water real quick
[03:02:14.400 --> 03:02:26.560]  Because I think I think it's late enough than day I can get cues now without waiting 40 minutes
[03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:37.280]  By the way, it is it is a teaching stream when I'm doing that like ad carry academy thing
[03:02:37.280 --> 03:02:40.480]  So if you guys have any questions you want to ask or like you guys can ignore that
[03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:43.040]  If you guys have any questions you want to ask or anything like that's
[03:02:43.840 --> 03:02:46.400]  You know if we're just chilling between games just ask whatever you want
[03:02:46.400 --> 03:02:50.400]  I I'll I can answer a lot easier between games that I can't in game
[03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:54.160]  You know, it's a lot easier for me to see that shit. I try and answer in game
[03:02:54.160 --> 03:02:57.680]  But like sometimes I'm like focusing and shit. So it's a little harder
[03:03:04.800 --> 03:03:08.000]  Uh, I am gonna get some water though, so I'll be right back. Okay
[03:03:09.360 --> 03:03:11.360]  Talk amongst yourselves
[03:03:11.680 --> 03:03:14.800]  Is kraken troll on kate? No kraken's good on kate
[03:03:15.520 --> 03:03:22.800]  Uh, you can go kraken into bloodthirster or kraken into ie if you really need it if um if they have like tanks so they have like scion
[03:03:23.920 --> 03:03:26.960]  So 20 stuff like that that you have to like you're the only damage
[03:03:26.960 --> 03:03:30.160]  So let's say you're like the only tank killer on the team. You're like the only ad damage
[03:03:30.720 --> 03:03:32.720]  You have to go kraken sometimes
[03:03:41.360 --> 03:03:43.360]  You
[03:04:11.360 --> 03:04:13.360]  You
[03:04:41.360 --> 03:04:43.360]  Um
[03:05:11.360 --> 03:05:13.360]  You
[03:05:41.360 --> 03:05:43.360]  You
[03:06:11.360 --> 03:06:13.360]  You
[03:06:29.600 --> 03:06:32.080]  Oh, I just sat down sweet
[03:06:32.080 --> 03:06:34.080]  I
[03:06:37.520 --> 03:06:39.520]  Swear it
[03:06:40.080 --> 03:06:42.080]  I just sat back down. I was like, oh, yeah
[03:06:43.600 --> 03:06:47.040]  Let's go kupo. Oh somebody declined it. Fuck
[03:06:48.640 --> 03:06:50.640]  All right boys, let's go

[03:07:02.240 --> 03:07:04.240]  rice cake
[03:07:16.240 --> 03:07:20.400]  You also have my hair today, what the fuck there we go
[03:07:29.840 --> 03:07:31.840]  All right boys
[03:07:32.560 --> 03:07:34.560]  What are we playing?
[03:07:45.120 --> 03:07:48.160]  I don't really care about banning you me most of the time, but we'll just do it
[03:07:58.240 --> 03:08:01.360]  I don't remember what we were talking about oh supports. Yeah, they're all stupid
[03:08:02.160 --> 03:08:08.720]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha sky. Oh, that's so good. That's so good
[03:08:20.080 --> 03:08:22.880]  All right, what am I playing or was Varys
[03:08:25.920 --> 03:08:27.920]  Hmm
[03:08:33.040 --> 03:08:40.480]  You just play jinx milio jinx milio pretty pretty gross land pretty gross land
[03:08:49.360 --> 03:08:51.360]  Um
[03:08:52.720 --> 03:08:54.720]  Kaisa I didn't want to pick kaisa into Varys
[03:08:55.440 --> 03:08:56.640]  I could have picked kaisa this game
[03:08:56.640 --> 03:08:59.840]  But I kind of wanted to pick jinx because milio jinx is really good
[03:09:00.560 --> 03:09:02.560]  It's like a super super op land
[03:09:07.520 --> 03:09:09.760]  Somebody dodged okay figures out
[03:09:14.480 --> 03:09:22.160]  All right, I'm back. What's up? I don't remember what we were talking about. Oh supports. Yeah, they're all stupid
[03:09:22.880 --> 03:09:24.880]  Ha ha ha ha ha
[03:09:26.400 --> 03:09:32.640]  I mean listen every 80 carries default state of mind listen. I'm not wrong
[03:09:42.720 --> 03:09:44.720]  I ain't wrong
[03:09:46.480 --> 03:09:48.800]  I need to see if this guy is the pike player or not
[03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:54.480]  Before I ban this because like I don't want to play versus pike usually pikes are all like one tricks and shit
[03:09:54.720 --> 03:09:56.720]  I don't want to play versus a pike player
[03:09:57.280 --> 03:10:00.080]  But I needed to know that my support wasn't the pike player, you know
[03:10:03.360 --> 03:10:05.360]  He doesn't seem to care
[03:10:07.760 --> 03:10:10.560]  Ash milio is really good too. Yeah, no ash milio is really good
[03:10:19.760 --> 03:10:21.760]  It's a tragedy
[03:10:30.560 --> 03:10:34.720]  Dude I always have to first pick every game every game I have to first pick every single one
[03:10:49.360 --> 03:10:51.600]  You're not liking the camera over there. Oh
[03:10:55.760 --> 03:10:57.760]  My bad
[03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:16.720]  Can we revert it with points
[03:11:19.040 --> 03:11:24.080]  Are you motherfuckers trying to like bid war to to where my camera is right now
[03:11:29.280 --> 03:11:31.280]  Is that what's happening
[03:11:41.680 --> 03:11:43.680]  Hmm
[03:11:44.800 --> 03:11:46.800]  You know what's interesting
[03:11:49.200 --> 03:11:56.320]  I don't know what some I want to take here. I almost want to take cleanse because they have
[03:11:59.040 --> 03:12:02.480]  They have a felios queue lulu slow lulu cc
[03:12:03.360 --> 03:12:06.640]  Hecarim fear and ariel. I mean Ari charm
[03:12:07.520 --> 03:12:10.320]  But every single one of those is avoidable if I'm not bad
[03:12:12.960 --> 03:12:14.960]  It's hard to tell
[03:12:15.280 --> 03:12:19.120]  Because like every single one of those things is like avoidable if I'm not trash at the game
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:24.000]  So it's like you would be just be taking cleanse for like
[03:12:29.120 --> 03:12:33.680]  But you do take away a lot of their ability to kill you if you take cleanse
[03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:42.000]  Right
[03:12:45.920 --> 03:12:52.320]  I'm gonna greed I might regret this though like my gut is telling me to take cleanse
[03:12:53.520 --> 03:12:56.800]  Because if I take cleanser they only have one way to kill me
[03:13:07.360 --> 03:13:12.960]  Oh look guys it's 20. Yo, it's all stylish. I think no, this is a fake stylish
[03:13:15.040 --> 03:13:17.040]  Wait isn't 21 stylish the fake stylish
[03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:24.160]  Is that the real one or the fake one there's like a fake one out there and I don't know if that's the real one or the fake one
[03:13:28.560 --> 03:13:30.560]  Oh, it's stylish nice
[03:13:32.640 --> 03:13:34.640]  What reverse again
[03:13:37.520 --> 03:13:39.520]  I'll take long long three
[03:13:44.960 --> 03:13:46.960]  I
[03:14:04.880 --> 03:14:06.880]  Will take long three this game just because um
[03:14:06.880 --> 03:14:08.880]  I
[03:14:18.720 --> 03:14:23.040]  Actually like long three more against double range because you can't get poked out
[03:14:32.080 --> 03:14:34.400]  Why don't you like ghost over hill I do like ghost
[03:14:35.280 --> 03:14:36.720]  um
[03:14:36.720 --> 03:14:39.360]  This game particularly I don't think ghost has more value though
[03:14:40.880 --> 03:14:42.560]  because
[03:14:42.560 --> 03:14:45.760]  The only like ghost is really good against like triple melee
[03:14:48.560 --> 03:14:51.840]  Like I like ghost a lot against like triple melee jumps or comps
[03:14:52.720 --> 03:14:56.240]  But there's only two melees and one of them. I don't even consider heckra ma melee
[03:14:57.920 --> 03:14:59.920]  That comes like a fucking
[03:15:00.560 --> 03:15:02.560]  You motherfucker
[03:15:02.640 --> 03:15:04.640]  I
[03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:07.200]  I'm so gonna sassan so
[03:15:22.080 --> 03:15:26.080]  You know what's interesting this logo is bullying the fuck out of us
[03:15:28.640 --> 03:15:30.640]  I'm trying to get level two
[03:15:33.280 --> 03:15:35.280]  So
[03:15:37.040 --> 03:15:39.040]  I think Lulu has
[03:15:39.920 --> 03:15:43.040]  We could we could just double either guy
[03:15:46.960 --> 03:15:48.960]  Why would you do that
[03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:00.560]  I'm confused as to like what's happening here
[03:16:03.120 --> 03:16:08.160]  Why aren't we fighting these guys
[03:16:10.400 --> 03:16:13.680]  This this senator this this uh seraphine's trolling
[03:16:14.560 --> 03:16:16.560]  So all she had to do there was double e
[03:16:16.960 --> 03:16:21.920]  That's it. If she double e'd either of them. They instantly die because we have heal. They don't have heal and we have exhaust
[03:16:22.640 --> 03:16:29.600]  They've they've they have ghosts. So all you have to do to win that is double e walk up exhaust the aphelios and we win like he dies
[03:16:33.040 --> 03:16:37.360]  I'm impressed that this guy's I I don't want to be mean nevermind
[03:16:39.280 --> 03:16:41.280]  I there's no reason to be mean
[03:16:42.080 --> 03:16:45.040]  Maybe he just doesn't uh play seraphine that much
[03:16:47.440 --> 03:16:51.680]  I mean, yeah, he like the seraphine should be walking up right now. You see how like far back she is
[03:16:52.640 --> 03:16:54.960]  I can't walk up like at the moment. I just can't
[03:17:03.360 --> 03:17:05.360]  Oh
[03:17:06.080 --> 03:17:08.080]  That was good fucking juke
[03:17:09.440 --> 03:17:11.440]  I really want to push this
[03:17:14.400 --> 03:17:16.560]  Oh my stylish and god
[03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:22.000]  If he's that was just kind of a god
[03:17:26.720 --> 03:17:29.920]  Yeah, what the fuck that was just insane
[03:17:30.240 --> 03:17:32.240]  I mean, it's fucking smurfing
[03:17:36.240 --> 03:17:39.040]  Jesus like that was dirty
[03:17:42.800 --> 03:17:44.800]  Guys nuts
[03:18:00.720 --> 03:18:02.720]  I
[03:18:08.320 --> 03:18:12.720]  Didn't put any points in my e because when we were in the lane I didn't have enough
[03:18:16.640 --> 03:18:21.680]  Uh, I didn't have enough man. I didn't use e anyway, so there was no real point to put it in there at the time
[03:18:22.240 --> 03:18:24.240]  I kind of wish I had e now, but
[03:18:29.920 --> 03:18:31.920]  I
[03:18:38.240 --> 03:18:40.240]  Oh, that was a misposition Jesus
[03:18:43.200 --> 03:18:47.280]  I'm just off today. I don't know why I don't need to push this I can just let it sit
[03:18:48.560 --> 03:18:52.320]  I thinned it a tiny bit now what we can do here is we just let it sit there
[03:18:53.120 --> 03:18:55.120]  The failures can't walk up
[03:18:55.920 --> 03:19:01.760]  Now I would want the seraphine to be like in the bush over there like like up a bit, right?
[03:19:02.320 --> 03:19:06.720]  Because if she stands in that bush a felios can't walk up whereas if she's behind me
[03:19:07.440 --> 03:19:09.760]  A felios can walk up stand in that bush and soak xp
[03:19:10.480 --> 03:19:13.440]  So stopping the xp soak is very important
[03:19:16.720 --> 03:19:21.120]  I need to run to this fight. I think the fight's over already. I think my team trolled but I'm still gonna run to it
[03:19:25.120 --> 03:19:27.120]  So
[03:19:43.120 --> 03:19:45.120]  I'm very low right now
[03:19:45.280 --> 03:19:49.680]  Um, I think the only thing to do is actually just the back so the way the wave is set up right now
[03:19:50.640 --> 03:19:55.600]  I can't push it before they get back to lane it will like slow push towards them
[03:19:56.640 --> 03:19:58.640]  But I don't think I have a choice
[03:19:59.920 --> 03:20:02.720]  I'd have to this is something that I'm actually I'd have to actually rewatch
[03:20:03.840 --> 03:20:05.840]  I know I think it's actually frozen
[03:20:06.560 --> 03:20:09.120]  But I think maybe I should have cleared one minion maybe two
[03:20:10.080 --> 03:20:12.320]  So that it doesn't like crash and it stays frozen
[03:20:15.200 --> 03:20:17.200]  Unless I did it correctly
[03:20:17.760 --> 03:20:24.960]  Maybe I'm overthinking it. All right. I think I did it right. Yeah, I did. Okay, nevermind. I thought I was like overthinking it
[03:20:39.280 --> 03:20:41.920]  What I think about ghosts instead of healing jinks, I think it's great
[03:20:42.880 --> 03:20:49.520]  Like I said, um, this game specifically I think heal has more value, but I think in a lot of games ghost is very good
[03:20:51.120 --> 03:20:53.520]  Ghost is good on ash good on jinx good on a felios
[03:20:54.160 --> 03:20:58.080]  Zary like ad carries at the moment the ghost meta is really good because like
[03:20:58.480 --> 03:21:04.720]  There's a really heavy like tank bruiser meta going on right coupled with like an enchantery meta or like a
[03:21:05.200 --> 03:21:10.320]  bot lane where it's like a bunch of mele's I suck Jesus and because of that. I think it's actually
[03:21:12.240 --> 03:21:16.720]  Ghost is super good. I just this game. There's only two mele's on the enemy team and um
[03:21:20.240 --> 03:21:23.200]  I didn't want to just farm lane this I wanted to be able to fight early
[03:21:25.040 --> 03:21:28.800]  Well, okay, so the reason you take ghosts is because you farm lane
[03:21:30.480 --> 03:21:33.680]  You're not looking to fight early when you take ghost. That's the whole point of ghost
[03:21:34.080 --> 03:21:36.080]  It's a scaling. It's a hundred percent a scaling
[03:21:36.640 --> 03:21:39.520]  Summoner, so if you're playing in lower elo, um
[03:21:40.400 --> 03:21:46.000]  And you you know you want to take ghost or you want to try it out just realize that like you are trying to scale
[03:21:47.680 --> 03:21:51.760]  Oh somebody afked, okay, that's cringe
[03:21:57.440 --> 03:22:01.360]  Like if you're in say you're in like gold silver plat whatever elo you're in
[03:22:01.760 --> 03:22:04.320]  That's like you deemed as like, you know a bit of the lower elos
[03:22:04.640 --> 03:22:07.120]  I don't even pick plots that low, but a golden silver, right?
[03:22:07.920 --> 03:22:12.160]  Um because gold is average, so it's like not even low typically, but everybody says it's low
[03:22:15.120 --> 03:22:20.640]  If you if you take ghost just understand that you are playing for mid game bronze still you're playing for mid game
[03:22:20.640 --> 03:22:25.360]  Yeah ghost is fun. I I would take personally. I would probably take heal in bronze
[03:22:26.160 --> 03:22:30.240]  Just because I think you can take advantage of lane phase really hard in bronze
[03:22:30.960 --> 03:22:32.960]  Like bronze elo to me is like
[03:22:34.240 --> 03:22:38.000]  I should have reported that guy. I'm stupid bronze elo to me is like
[03:22:38.400 --> 03:22:40.400]  Uh, you can learn how to
[03:22:41.040 --> 03:22:45.280]  Abuse people's lane phase really hard because people will fight a lot in bronze, right?
[03:22:45.280 --> 03:22:50.240]  Like they will take bad trades or they will like try and fight because they don't know typically if you're bronze
[03:22:50.240 --> 03:22:54.480]  You probably don't know like the champions very well and the damage stuff and stuff like that
[03:22:54.800 --> 03:22:58.640]  So what ends up happening is like you probably just die a bunch or there are problems
[03:22:58.880 --> 03:23:01.360]  die a bunch or there are probably a lot of deaths in bronze
[03:23:02.000 --> 03:23:04.000]  so
[03:23:04.720 --> 03:23:06.720]  I would say
[03:23:06.880 --> 03:23:12.480]  Playing to like be able to help yourself early game with all the fighting going on is going to have a lot more value than ghost
[03:23:14.400 --> 03:23:20.480]  Ghost is more of like a oh we hit mid game or a giant fight broke out and I can like it's an extended long fight
[03:23:20.480 --> 03:23:22.480]  And I can get ghost utilization
[03:23:22.640 --> 03:23:25.440]  Also ghost is really valuable when you have good mechanical skill
[03:23:26.160 --> 03:23:28.560]  Like ghost requires very good positioning typically
[03:23:29.200 --> 03:23:34.560]  Because you're repositioning a lot in the fight and that's why ghost is so good because you can reposition back forward back forward back forward
[03:23:35.040 --> 03:23:37.040]  and you can essentially like
[03:23:37.200 --> 03:23:39.200]  space the enemy and
[03:23:39.200 --> 03:23:41.200]  get free damage
[03:23:43.280 --> 03:23:45.840]  Free boots too depends on the champion and the matchup
[03:23:46.880 --> 03:23:47.760]  like
[03:23:47.760 --> 03:23:50.080]  If I'm playing jinx and I'm playing into like
[03:23:51.200 --> 03:23:52.240]  I don't know
[03:23:52.240 --> 03:23:55.920]  Let's say I'm playing into like heiseulu. Okay, you can take free boots
[03:23:56.160 --> 03:23:59.440]  You don't need early boots in that matchup because it's an enchanter farm
[03:23:59.760 --> 03:24:02.160]  80 carry versus an enchanter farm 80 carry. Okay
[03:24:02.880 --> 03:24:07.120]  Now if I'm versus let's say I'm versus like a blitzcrank. Let's say I'm playing jinx and I'm versus blitz
[03:24:07.840 --> 03:24:12.160]  Like I typically don't want to have to wait till nine minutes to get boots because blitzcrank is gonna shit on me
[03:24:12.960 --> 03:24:13.760]  so
[03:24:13.760 --> 03:24:17.440]  I will take different runes versus that blitzcrank to allow myself
[03:24:17.440 --> 03:24:22.880]  The option of like let's say I have 1100 gold and I back I can get early boots and now
[03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:26.240]  The blitzcrank has a much harder time
[03:24:30.880 --> 03:24:35.040]  Dude I almost want to ban zed because I don't want to get shit on by stylish, but I think it's cringe
[03:24:36.560 --> 03:24:38.560]  I don't want to like ban stylish outs
[03:24:47.440 --> 03:24:49.440]  I
[03:24:55.040 --> 03:24:59.280]  Often is 80 carry bot. Do you play parallel to your support? You try to always
[03:25:01.680 --> 03:25:04.960]  Essentially the perfect way to play bot lane is you're both hitting one target
[03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:09.440]  At the same time trading on one target at the same time. You're making like a little triangle
[03:25:10.400 --> 03:25:13.440]  And you're both just like standing next to each other and you're both hitting that one target, right?
[03:25:14.400 --> 03:25:18.880]  That's the best way to play bot lane, but it's very hard in solo queue obviously to do that
[03:25:21.520 --> 03:25:23.520]  But if you have like a duo you can practice it
[03:25:24.400 --> 03:25:26.800]  Sorry it went down the wrong pipe 80 carry tier of us
[03:25:27.920 --> 03:25:29.760]  I should make one
[03:25:29.760 --> 03:25:31.600]  I have this thing where
[03:25:31.600 --> 03:25:33.600]  Even though I'm like grandmaster level
[03:25:35.440 --> 03:25:37.440]  I still think I suck
[03:25:37.440 --> 03:25:41.600]  I have this like running lack of confidence because I used to be challenger and now I'm like hard stuck jam
[03:25:42.160 --> 03:25:44.400]  So like I have this lack of confidence in what I'm talking about
[03:25:45.920 --> 03:25:50.160]  So like I feel like if I were to make a tier list it would be based on like a gm players
[03:25:50.720 --> 03:25:51.600]  skill
[03:25:51.600 --> 03:25:54.640]  And I I don't know if like I don't want to get ripped apart by people
[03:25:56.800 --> 03:25:59.300]  But I guess I could make a tier list from my own opinion
[03:26:11.600 --> 03:26:20.900]  I think let me see tier list maker. I'm sure there's a tier list maker with champions, right?
[03:26:42.320 --> 03:26:44.320]  You
[03:26:52.560 --> 03:26:56.480]  Yeah, there it is wait, this is terrible. What is what are these pictures?
[03:27:03.040 --> 03:27:08.400]  I'm just what what is this? What is this? Why is nico on here?
[03:27:12.080 --> 03:27:14.080]  I
[03:27:19.680 --> 03:27:22.080]  Want to use this one, but this one doesn't have zerry
[03:27:26.160 --> 03:27:30.320]  I'm trying to find one with zerry on it that doesn't look like shit it says this one has zerry
[03:27:31.120 --> 03:27:33.680]  But it looks like it looks shitty. I don't I don't enjoy that
[03:27:41.920 --> 03:27:43.920]  I
[03:27:45.440 --> 03:27:47.680]  Hold on we're gonna play ash this game because they picked zareth
[03:27:48.640 --> 03:27:51.600]  Like I just saw him first pick zareth. So I want something that can engage on the zareth
[03:27:53.440 --> 03:27:57.360]  So we're gonna go ash these gonna be my ash ruins this game boys. Um
[03:28:01.360 --> 03:28:03.360]  Do I want to go presence of minds?
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:08.000]  I don't know
[03:28:08.880 --> 03:28:16.000]  I kind of do but I kind of don't I think presence of mind kind of sucks it feels kind of shitty
[03:28:20.720 --> 03:28:24.320]  Hmm we can just do overkill we can go lakrity
[03:28:27.120 --> 03:28:30.240]  I probably won't go kraken sir this game so we could probably just go lakrity
[03:28:32.080 --> 03:28:35.120]  Even though kraken sir is not battle mash. I kind of want to go board crush
[03:28:38.560 --> 03:28:40.560]  I
[03:28:42.320 --> 03:28:44.320]  Could go
[03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:51.840]  I actually don't know what I want to take if I want to take borderline or a lakrity. I'm gonna take a lakrity. We'll try it out
[03:28:53.280 --> 03:28:55.280]  And then we'll do ghost. Okay. Um
[03:28:56.160 --> 03:28:58.160]  What's that gonna say?
[03:28:58.640 --> 03:29:01.280]  Oh, yeah, yeah, I need to find the right tier list
[03:29:05.920 --> 03:29:07.920]  I mean I could just use this right
[03:29:08.720 --> 03:29:10.720]  I can't where's zerry
[03:29:17.360 --> 03:29:19.360]  Oh, oh there we go
[03:29:20.880 --> 03:29:24.560]  Yeah, this is good. Okay. I was like I was trying to figure it out. I was like what the fuck
[03:29:26.720 --> 03:29:30.160]  Uh, I think just straight out of the gate. I was putting jinx and s tier
[03:29:31.520 --> 03:29:34.720]  I think jinx is just an s tier champion. She's crazy op
[03:29:35.520 --> 03:29:41.520]  Like jinx just does whatever champion wants to do but like better than them. She's blind pickable
[03:29:42.160 --> 03:29:44.160]  Her two item three item spike is crazy
[03:29:45.200 --> 03:29:49.200]  She's doesn't have a lot of like really bad matchups and lane phase anymore
[03:29:50.000 --> 03:29:52.960]  They gave her scaling like crazy high like she's just good
[03:29:54.560 --> 03:29:57.120]  Good build paths, etc. Like she's just a good champion
[03:29:59.840 --> 03:30:03.920]  Uh, I would say it's also hard to do tier list because you have to do tier list for like low
[03:30:03.920 --> 03:30:08.160]  Elo and high Elo, right? Because if I'm doing like a low Elo tier list
[03:30:09.040 --> 03:30:11.040]  You're putting a math like here
[03:30:11.840 --> 03:30:15.680]  Right like MF super good. If you're doing a high Elo tier list MF's like here
[03:30:17.440 --> 03:30:19.440]  It's it's hard to explain
[03:30:19.920 --> 03:30:21.920]  And like in low Elo I'm putting Kalista here
[03:30:22.640 --> 03:30:24.640]  But in high Elo I'm putting her here
[03:30:25.760 --> 03:30:27.760]  So it's it's really interesting
[03:30:27.920 --> 03:30:37.120]  Right because it's all based on like people's mechanical skill too, but yeah, we do the tier list between games, I guess
[03:30:38.480 --> 03:30:43.200]  So far I think jinx is definitely s tier. I wish there was like an s plus tier
[03:30:45.440 --> 03:30:47.440]  But jinx is definitely s tier
[03:30:47.760 --> 03:30:49.680]  Draven's hard to choose for me
[03:30:49.680 --> 03:30:53.920]  Like I want to put him in a tier because he has a lot of counter matchups, but in solo queue
[03:30:54.480 --> 03:30:56.480]  Draven feels insane
[03:30:58.720 --> 03:31:02.720]  So it's hard because I I don't think I think Draven's overrated personally
[03:31:03.520 --> 03:31:05.520]  Because I know how to beat Draven players
[03:31:05.920 --> 03:31:07.920]  But I also think in high Elo
[03:31:09.280 --> 03:31:12.080]  When people also know how to deal with Draven players the game
[03:31:15.440 --> 03:31:17.440]  I also do feel like uh
[03:31:18.720 --> 03:31:22.400]  Good Draven players and good people who know how to play around Draven players make Draven OP
[03:31:22.960 --> 03:31:25.040]  Uh, but it's also the the opposite where good players
[03:31:25.120 --> 03:31:29.440]  You know how to play around Draven can counter pick Draven and make him worthless. So it's it's really
[03:31:30.800 --> 03:31:32.800]  It's really hard
[03:31:45.920 --> 03:31:50.800]  All right, let me say morgana versus
[03:31:51.040 --> 03:31:53.040]  I
[03:31:54.880 --> 03:31:56.880]  Moo moo
[03:31:57.840 --> 03:32:01.360]  Jin players jin players are psychopaths man. Like I
[03:32:03.120 --> 03:32:06.800]  I don't think jin's very good right now. I think he could be good if they gave him like a quality life change
[03:32:07.200 --> 03:32:09.200]  Isn't he getting buff next patch?
[03:32:11.680 --> 03:32:13.680]  I think he's getting buffed
[03:32:15.120 --> 03:32:19.280]  I think he should do like jin's such a fun champ. He's just like a little shitty
[03:32:20.960 --> 03:32:32.480]  We can actually just straight fight them right now if I'm a mood just cues
[03:32:35.920 --> 03:32:37.920]  Because morgana is worthless level one
[03:32:44.160 --> 03:32:46.240]  The guy actually just straight up want to fight these guys right now
[03:32:48.480 --> 03:32:50.480]  Go go go
[03:32:50.800 --> 03:32:52.800]  Oh
[03:33:01.040 --> 03:33:03.040]  He missed both his cues
[03:33:03.440 --> 03:33:06.080]  Dude this guy this a moomoo's killing me man
[03:33:08.240 --> 03:33:10.240]  Oh my god, I
[03:33:11.360 --> 03:33:13.360]  Bro, what am I watching?
[03:33:15.360 --> 03:33:17.360]  What are the what are these cues brother?
[03:33:17.760 --> 03:33:19.760]  Oh
[03:33:23.920 --> 03:33:27.360]  Shit all right, I should have taken longsword
[03:33:31.680 --> 03:33:34.400]  A moomoo is not feeling himself today. Let me tell you what
[03:33:37.360 --> 03:33:39.360]  He is not feeling himself
[03:33:47.360 --> 03:33:49.360]  I
[03:33:54.800 --> 03:33:58.960]  Chase even if as comes chase. Okay, we run
[03:34:05.520 --> 03:34:10.240]  Uh, I don't know if we can fight this we can try I'll folly
[03:34:18.080 --> 03:34:20.080]  I
[03:34:24.400 --> 03:34:26.400]  Mean that guy should die
[03:34:32.400 --> 03:34:36.400]  Dude what I don't even know what's happening right now. This is this is crazy
[03:34:40.080 --> 03:34:44.480]  This is this is ridiculous both mid laners just got like three kills out of nowhere
[03:34:48.240 --> 03:35:00.800]  We went from like a ridiculously we went from like a grandmaster game to like a diamond game like somehow
[03:35:03.840 --> 03:35:06.480]  Like the moomoo's like kind of whipping some shit
[03:35:07.840 --> 03:35:12.560]  Uh, I took a bad trade early then fucking this shit is funny as fuck
[03:35:12.560 --> 03:35:18.080]  So I'm gonna I'm gonna actually rush tier two boots this game
[03:35:19.520 --> 03:35:22.480]  Because I actually really really really
[03:35:24.000 --> 03:35:26.000]  Want to be mobile against their team
[03:35:26.160 --> 03:35:31.520]  Like I'm just gonna straight up leave go buy t2 boots and that's gonna be my my power spike for ash right now
[03:35:33.600 --> 03:35:38.640]  They have so many things that I can dodge on their team like look at the shit right like morgue binding
[03:35:39.120 --> 03:35:44.160]  T2 boots super easy to dodge if she can't flash it on me right or if she can't flash melee range that morgue bind
[03:35:44.480 --> 03:35:47.040]  It's I should never get hit by unless I have no fingers
[03:35:47.840 --> 03:35:49.840]  Ezreal cute easy to dodge
[03:35:50.240 --> 03:35:53.440]  Zarath easy to dodge this guy whatever the fuck
[03:35:54.160 --> 03:35:58.080]  Kozak bug man needs a melee champ so boots have value etc
[03:36:03.120 --> 03:36:06.880]  Also the cool thing about boots boots rush ash is she doesn't have damage
[03:36:08.720 --> 03:36:12.240]  That uh, if I'm good at spacing like the better at spacing you are
[03:36:13.840 --> 03:36:15.840]  You can actually just 1v2
[03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:18.560]  Especially against double skill shots like this
[03:36:20.080 --> 03:36:22.080]  It's pretty fun
[03:36:39.280 --> 03:36:41.280]  I
[03:36:45.520 --> 03:36:47.760]  Fuck if I juke that last q I would have killed that guy
[03:36:48.640 --> 03:36:54.400]  Dude zarath actually fucked us so bad though. That was a good fight until zarath just showed up and beat our ass
[03:36:54.720 --> 03:36:56.720]  I
[03:37:11.280 --> 03:37:18.560]  It's kind of funny to watch though because I do so little damage, but I also like just perma slow so they can't do anything about it
[03:37:19.280 --> 03:37:25.760]  Hopefully when tf gets six he can come bot and we can fuck over there balling
[03:37:27.520 --> 03:37:29.520]  I'm hoping that that's the case
[03:37:35.440 --> 03:37:38.960]  Uh, we're gonna roam to mid. Kozaks is also mid tf's dead
[03:37:43.600 --> 03:37:45.600]  That's a good roam
[03:37:48.880 --> 03:37:56.080]  I'm gonna push this so that maybe we can play for a dragon because they might go for a dragon here and I think we can stop it
[03:37:58.640 --> 03:38:00.640]  We have tf ults
[03:38:04.240 --> 03:38:06.240]  Yep
[03:38:08.320 --> 03:38:13.760]  Nice we just leave we don't need to actually chase or do anything crazy. We're just stopping the dragon. That's all we're doing
[03:38:15.360 --> 03:38:17.360]  Right, we don't want to give him a free drake
[03:38:18.720 --> 03:38:24.640]  So you the t2 boots are just broken they're broken as shit
[03:38:31.760 --> 03:38:36.560]  Because you can just see like I can I can pretty much just I'm just too fast for them to deal with
[03:38:39.680 --> 03:38:41.680]  Like look at this it's it's insane
[03:38:49.520 --> 03:38:57.520]  And that's why I value like the tier 2 boots on champions, especially like ash where you can be extra egregious with it
[03:38:58.000 --> 03:39:00.000]  Because like her slow
[03:39:00.480 --> 03:39:04.800]  Imagine it's like, you know, it's the same idea as vain right when you think about it. It's like, okay, so
[03:39:05.520 --> 03:39:10.880]  What's really annoying trying to run away from a vein right? She gets boots too and you're like god damn it man
[03:39:10.880 --> 03:39:13.840]  She's so fast same thing with ash. Oh wait now you're slow
[03:39:14.000 --> 03:39:17.440]  So it's even more annoying you try you try and go in on her
[03:39:17.440 --> 03:39:23.200]  She just spaces you walks away a bit now you're just sitting there waddling towards her slowly just upset tilted frustrated
[03:39:24.720 --> 03:39:26.720]  You know, it's like your middle school dance
[03:39:44.800 --> 03:39:46.800]  You know what
[03:39:49.200 --> 03:39:51.200]  I think this is actually a shield bow game
[03:39:52.560 --> 03:39:56.520]  It is I was gonna go Bork, but I think this is shield bow game
[03:39:58.080 --> 03:40:01.120]  It could be a gale force game too both both are both are viable
[03:40:02.480 --> 03:40:06.800]  But uh, I actually I might be one of the I might be in the minority here with this
[03:40:06.800 --> 03:40:10.760]  I think Bork rush on ash is actually good sometimes
[03:40:11.160 --> 03:40:16.040]  Like I think if I was versus some tanks like, you know like a scion or something like that
[03:40:16.360 --> 03:40:18.360]  I actually think Bork rush and ash is kind of cracked
[03:40:19.720 --> 03:40:23.960]  Like yeah, it stalls out like you make the argument like it stalls out your three item or your two item
[03:40:24.520 --> 03:40:26.520]  But it's it feels kind of nuts
[03:40:27.960 --> 03:40:31.400]  Also, this is a really op thing that you can do. I should have hawk shot it sooner
[03:40:31.880 --> 03:40:36.360]  I knew that they were doing uh rift, but I'm not paying attention as much as I should be
[03:40:37.400 --> 03:40:39.400]  so
[03:40:41.480 --> 03:40:43.480]  I
[03:40:43.880 --> 03:40:49.400]  Because what you can do is you can hawk shot to tell your team where the enemy jungler is and get information yourself
[03:40:53.640 --> 03:40:55.640]  I mean this more gun is level five
[03:40:57.560 --> 03:40:59.960]  We could fight just because morgue is five right now
[03:41:01.800 --> 03:41:03.800]  Uh, I kind of want to try
[03:41:03.800 --> 03:41:05.800]  Uh
[03:41:08.520 --> 03:41:12.120]  Uh-oh my moomoo didn't want to go in my bad
[03:41:15.800 --> 03:41:17.800]  I'm a little sad. I'm not gonna lie because
[03:41:18.200 --> 03:41:22.120]  I do feel like we win these fights, but a moomoo wants to wait for six
[03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:28.360]  Which is fine. But like I said, you guys know me. I like to actually fight and be active in the lane early
[03:41:29.160 --> 03:41:31.160]  Because I know that we can fight right
[03:41:32.120 --> 03:41:34.120]  And so it's like obviously, you know
[03:41:43.480 --> 03:41:47.080]  Oh, this is really rough I can't do anything
[03:41:49.720 --> 03:41:51.720]  Because there it's here
[03:41:52.520 --> 03:41:57.400]  TF's coming with ult though. I don't have ult. God damn it. If I had ult this would be so god tier
[03:41:57.720 --> 03:42:02.440]  God you have no idea how OP this would be if I had ulti man
[03:42:03.880 --> 03:42:05.880]  Whenever I'm bad
[03:42:07.400 --> 03:42:09.720]  I want to push this wave out. I'm assuming they're all backing
[03:42:11.800 --> 03:42:16.680]  I think we penta there it was we even killed the top laner. Oh, I'm dead. Why did I stay?
[03:42:18.280 --> 03:42:19.560]  I knew
[03:42:19.560 --> 03:42:20.680]  Cosyx would do that
[03:42:20.680 --> 03:42:25.640]  I have to retrain my brain cosyx players are rats and I have to retrain my brain to remember that they will sit in a
[03:42:25.640 --> 03:42:29.160]  Bush for 30 minutes lose all of their farm to get one kill
[03:42:30.200 --> 03:42:32.200]  I like always forget that
[03:42:35.240 --> 03:42:37.560]  Like cosyx players are absolute fucking rats
[03:42:41.720 --> 03:42:48.040]  Like I respect Rengar players more than cosyx players. Yeah, I said it. I know hot take I know but I do
[03:42:51.880 --> 03:42:53.880]  I'm gonna try and arrow right here
[03:42:56.120 --> 03:42:58.120]  I got him
[03:43:00.200 --> 03:43:02.200]  You know that guy's pissed by the way
[03:43:03.400 --> 03:43:05.400]  God damn it
[03:43:10.760 --> 03:43:12.760]  He's gonna try and ult me from the bush
[03:43:13.560 --> 03:43:17.160]  You can always tell that you're about to get ulted when an Ezreal big big tip for you guys
[03:43:17.640 --> 03:43:21.400]  If an Ezreal ever walks out of vision, expect that he's ulting you
[03:43:22.360 --> 03:43:29.880]  I you would not believe you would not believe the amount of people that I kill with Ezreal by simply walking into a bush and ulting them
[03:43:30.280 --> 03:43:32.280]  And they forget that I exist
[03:43:32.920 --> 03:43:35.320]  I'm not I'm not even it happens so often
[03:43:36.520 --> 03:43:39.320]  They're just like, oh, yeah, he went in the bush. He's gonna hit his ult key
[03:43:40.280 --> 03:43:43.240]  Like I it is comical how often it happens
[03:43:44.200 --> 03:43:46.200]  And I'm sure you guys have died to it too
[03:43:47.160 --> 03:43:51.400]  Because it's like a thing where like you never see you barely you don't see Ezreal that often right
[03:43:51.880 --> 03:43:54.360]  So because you probably don't see Ezreal too often you're always like
[03:43:56.600 --> 03:43:58.600]  Oh interesting type shit
[03:44:03.080 --> 03:44:05.640]  I'm gonna grab this plate and then I'm gonna back up
[03:44:07.560 --> 03:44:10.040]  Cosyx is coming down here. So I'm gonna back the fuck up
[03:44:11.560 --> 03:44:13.560]  So I don't have arrow for 20
[03:44:14.120 --> 03:44:16.120]  Ezreal has triforce we need to back up a bit
[03:44:19.720 --> 03:44:23.960]  We might have to give dragon I could see giving dragon being okay though. It's not that bad
[03:44:32.680 --> 03:44:37.560]  Yeah, it's not it's not the worst to give drake here. I could even back so we don't get dove
[03:44:39.480 --> 03:44:42.360]  Like if we back now we might lose bot turret, but I can't walk up
[03:44:43.560 --> 03:44:49.240]  Yeah, that's what I didn't want to have happen. See that's
[03:44:52.680 --> 03:44:56.280]  I'm telling you bad rats absolute rats
[03:45:00.520 --> 03:45:04.280]  Cosyx players are rats man absolute literal rats
[03:45:04.280 --> 03:45:06.280]  I
[03:45:13.320 --> 03:45:16.200]  Oh that's classy that was a good dodge
[03:45:23.800 --> 03:45:28.440]  I can't even walk up bot uh, I can wait for the turret, but I can't walk up
[03:45:30.120 --> 03:45:32.120]  I'll just die
[03:45:32.200 --> 03:45:37.240]  That's another thing you have to just accept like I'm down 40 cs this game because we've just been getting
[03:45:38.040 --> 03:45:40.040]  We excited and we've also been getting uh
[03:45:42.040 --> 03:45:44.040]  Like a moomoo is not very good
[03:45:45.160 --> 03:45:48.200]  I don't I don't have a better way to say it. I don't have like a nice way to say it
[03:45:48.200 --> 03:45:50.200]  He's not having a good game
[03:45:51.400 --> 03:45:53.960]  And when your support doesn't have a good game you don't have a good game early
[03:45:54.920 --> 03:46:01.400]  So the best thing you can do is just try and uh farm up what you can don't die and scale for late
[03:46:02.840 --> 03:46:07.160]  That's all you can really do as an ad carry when your support sucks
[03:46:08.760 --> 03:46:13.240]  It feels really bad, but sometimes you just got to accept it, right?
[03:46:21.800 --> 03:46:28.200]  This Ezreal's not bad, but he's not good either. Oh, this guy's gonna try and hold me. I'm an old kill ran chair
[03:46:32.280 --> 03:46:34.280]  Nice
[03:46:44.760 --> 03:46:49.320]  I don't have ult up yet guys, I don't have ult up yet. I can't ulti
[03:46:50.680 --> 03:46:52.920]  I have ult now, but we need to bait them in a bit
[03:46:55.800 --> 03:47:00.200]  I don't even want to use my ult right now to be honest with you like I I really don't
[03:47:02.120 --> 03:47:05.960]  You know what's funny that xeris actually pretty good. I've played against him a few times in the past few seasons
[03:47:06.760 --> 03:47:09.560]  He's actually not bad. He used to be a support main
[03:47:11.080 --> 03:47:13.080]  Like he played xeris support
[03:47:15.480 --> 03:47:17.480]  That's why I recognized his name
[03:47:23.400 --> 03:47:28.200]  We should not go for this refs. I'm on a bad timer for this
[03:47:28.920 --> 03:47:32.600]  Because I'm really low hp and mana
[03:47:39.160 --> 03:47:42.440]  Oh, I don't have mana to arrow here guys
[03:47:51.160 --> 03:47:56.360]  I do don't want to arrow that because the the fiora can totally the fiora can do whatever it's called and
[03:47:58.280 --> 03:48:00.280]  I
[03:48:01.800 --> 03:48:07.480]  The fiora can uh, what's it whatever it's called uh, w it if she's fast enough and I didn't want to get my team killed
[03:48:09.000 --> 03:48:13.240]  The real issue here is that we're forcing okay, I'll tell you exactly what the real issue is
[03:48:15.480 --> 03:48:17.640]  We're forcing too many fights for no reason right now
[03:48:18.280 --> 03:48:22.600]  So like we're all forcing tons of fights at the moment, right? But there's no reason for us to force these fights
[03:48:23.560 --> 03:48:29.640]  I hear my mother that's that's why my team's getting uh tilted right like for some reason the amumu and the uh
[03:48:30.600 --> 03:48:32.600]  tf are both just like inting
[03:48:32.600 --> 03:48:35.800]  And they're both getting frustrated, but we actually win the game if we play it slow
[03:48:37.560 --> 03:48:40.520]  Like we can we can slow play this game out in scale, but it just takes time
[03:48:47.240 --> 03:48:51.000]  Because I specifically picked ash so that we could we had an answer for sarah
[03:48:51.880 --> 03:48:56.760]  Because we have tf and ash right so we have we have a really good answer for him the problem is um
[03:48:58.360 --> 03:49:00.360]  We need to like stop tilting and just like
[03:49:00.680 --> 03:49:05.240]  Understand that we can deal with him later. He's not like a he's not like an a soul right like a soul
[03:49:05.320 --> 03:49:07.640]  It's one of those champs that like you can't deal with
[03:49:11.240 --> 03:49:13.640]  Why did my amumu wait to use ulti?
[03:49:15.080 --> 03:49:17.080]  What
[03:49:17.080 --> 03:49:19.080]  He was in range
[03:49:19.080 --> 03:49:21.080]  I know he was
[03:49:28.440 --> 03:49:33.160]  Oh nice, okay, we gotta kill we need tf to play the game too though
[03:49:34.840 --> 03:49:37.400]  Our tf is really tilted so he's just sitting bot
[03:49:40.840 --> 03:49:42.840]  Amumu is extra tilted too, but I mean
[03:49:43.640 --> 03:49:46.760]  I'll be I'll be honest the amumu is playing worse than tf. It's just that he's
[03:49:47.480 --> 03:49:49.480]  Dude, I hate when stuff happens like this
[03:49:49.800 --> 03:49:54.440]  Stop stop pinging the guy man. He's already frustrated. You pinging him is not going to make him less frustrated
[03:49:55.560 --> 03:49:57.560]  You're just gonna piss him off more
[03:49:58.760 --> 03:50:00.760]  Like just play dude
[03:50:02.840 --> 03:50:08.200]  We have a really good uh team comp like we're behind right now, but we have a good team comp
[03:50:14.520 --> 03:50:16.520]  We should give this dragon by the way
[03:50:17.720 --> 03:50:19.720]  They got thousand percent we don't have tf ults
[03:50:21.080 --> 03:50:24.920]  Like maybe maybe we could fight this but the morgues here so she can spell through my arrow
[03:50:25.320 --> 03:50:27.320]  They got rift like we should give the drink
[03:50:29.880 --> 03:50:32.280]  We also have no vision control of this area
[03:50:33.400 --> 03:50:38.120]  Uh, so this is another thing of like why you guys wonder like why I play uh support in this hero
[03:50:38.840 --> 03:50:44.280]  Like I get asked a lot like why are you a support man now? I'm still an 80 man, but the thing is it's really hard
[03:50:44.760 --> 03:50:46.760]  To play the game when your supports
[03:50:47.240 --> 03:50:49.240]  Don't word correctly
[03:50:50.200 --> 03:50:54.200]  We can give this guys we can give it's not a huge deal gnar's top. We do not have to fight this
[03:50:55.240 --> 03:50:57.240]  Guys, we don't have to fight this
[03:50:57.400 --> 03:50:59.480]  It's back up. Yeah, like this isn't a fight
[03:51:04.440 --> 03:51:08.760]  It's only second dragon it's nothing wow I suck at CSing
[03:51:15.000 --> 03:51:17.000]  You
[03:51:19.880 --> 03:51:23.880]  But you see how little vision control we have on the map right now we have one ward here and that's about it
[03:51:25.240 --> 03:51:28.360]  Vision control is I say it's 90% of the game in solo queue
[03:51:29.000 --> 03:51:33.480]  That's why like I feel like supports are like the unsung hero like when you get a support who knows how to properly
[03:51:33.640 --> 03:51:35.960]  Throw out vision control. It feels insane
[03:51:36.360 --> 03:51:40.360]  We just got a push
[03:51:41.560 --> 03:51:44.760]  I do have hawk shot in a second we can see if they're on this
[03:51:46.200 --> 03:51:48.200]  Okay, they're not
[03:51:49.000 --> 03:51:51.000]  I can voli we can back up
[03:51:53.160 --> 03:51:55.160]  Cosics is above me right now
[03:52:00.200 --> 03:52:02.200]  Okay, Cosics wasted his ult. That's not bad
[03:52:03.160 --> 03:52:05.160]  Okay, Cosics wasted his ult. That's not bad
[03:52:07.000 --> 03:52:08.680]  We should back
[03:52:08.680 --> 03:52:11.640]  I don't want to take this fight tf could ulti, but he's not
[03:52:12.760 --> 03:52:14.360]  right
[03:52:14.360 --> 03:52:18.440]  Like this this is one of those moments where like I actually think we actually could have killed two of them right there
[03:52:19.000 --> 03:52:21.000]  if tf ulted
[03:52:21.160 --> 03:52:23.160]  Because they were out of position really hard
[03:52:25.560 --> 03:52:27.560]  But again, it's not like
[03:52:28.840 --> 03:52:31.640]  I think they're gonna walk I think Cosics is
[03:52:33.160 --> 03:52:35.160]  Yeah, he's he's somewhere up here. I don't know where he is
[03:52:36.200 --> 03:52:40.040]  And I can't I can't hawk shot. I wasted my hawk shot for this dragon or this baron
[03:52:42.360 --> 03:52:44.360]  They could be on baron
[03:52:44.600 --> 03:52:46.600]  We need to check but I have no hawk shots
[03:52:47.000 --> 03:52:50.680]  Okay, they're not they're not we're chilling good. Good. I need a hundred golds
[03:53:02.840 --> 03:53:07.000]  Yeah, I'm aware I'm getting ganked I'm I'm fully fucking aware trust me
[03:53:22.280 --> 03:53:26.600]  I'm just trying to force them to make a choice probably wasn't a great use of my ghost but
[03:53:32.920 --> 03:53:34.920]  I
[03:53:37.960 --> 03:53:39.960]  Say we bail I need to go get my item
[03:53:41.960 --> 03:53:44.920]  Ezreal's just pushing aside somehow I'm contested over there
[03:53:52.440 --> 03:53:54.600]  Somebody just TP bought what?
[03:53:57.960 --> 03:53:59.960]  What the fuck is this a moomoo doing
[03:54:00.600 --> 03:54:04.520]  What is my team doing? What are you guys doing? This is so awkward, man
[03:54:13.400 --> 03:54:17.320]  I mean guys guys kill kill the Cosics
[03:54:18.520 --> 03:54:20.520]  Oh, thank god
[03:54:20.920 --> 03:54:24.680]  I don't know why Cosics just dove to kill me of all people
[03:54:26.040 --> 03:54:29.640]  My man just like wanted me dead. He was like, yeah, fuck that 80 carry guy
[03:54:30.920 --> 03:54:32.920]  Like okay
[03:54:33.320 --> 03:54:35.320]  Sure
[03:54:35.640 --> 03:54:37.640]  Fuck me
[03:54:38.360 --> 03:54:40.360]  What do I want
[03:54:41.080 --> 03:54:46.040]  I feel like I need damage, but I don't know what gives me the highest damage here. Maybe just
[03:54:51.880 --> 03:54:55.720]  I don't know maybe just pd. I'm not actually sure
[03:54:55.880 --> 03:54:57.880]  I
[03:54:57.960 --> 03:55:03.800]  You would be good, but it doesn't give me like more it gives me like I use interesting in this position
[03:55:05.640 --> 03:55:08.040]  Like I almost want more movement speed from the like pd
[03:55:09.240 --> 03:55:13.800]  Even though normally like the utility is better like maybe bt is still the best and I'm just trolling
[03:55:20.120 --> 03:55:22.120]  We can just do dragon right now
[03:55:22.680 --> 03:55:26.040]  They have no tp here baron. I think we totally actually could do this
[03:55:27.320 --> 03:55:29.320]  I'm down to try if you if you want to rain gar
[03:55:31.320 --> 03:55:34.280]  They got two people bought they're setting up for dragon vision right now
[03:55:35.000 --> 03:55:37.880]  I'm actually kind of down to just try and play for baron here
[03:55:45.000 --> 03:55:49.080]  Like we could bait baron here and force them to walk into us with my arrow
[03:55:52.120 --> 03:55:54.120]  I
[03:56:17.480 --> 03:56:19.880]  Want to stay together because I don't know where the cossacks is
[03:56:22.680 --> 03:56:24.680]  Found him
[03:56:34.280 --> 03:56:41.080]  What is my mumu doing dude he has smite like I pull it out if you're gonna do this right like I use your brain man
[03:56:52.520 --> 03:57:00.440]  All right now we do baron though we have to we have to do baron
[03:57:04.520 --> 03:57:08.840]  This is like one of the worst players I've ever seen this a moment. He has no clue what he's doing by the way
[03:57:10.200 --> 03:57:12.200]  Like he's so dumb
[03:57:16.280 --> 03:57:19.000]  He's he's like flaming the tf he's in his mind
[03:57:19.000 --> 03:57:22.440]  He's so angry at this tf that he's ignoring every single thing that's going on
[03:57:23.320 --> 03:57:26.120]  Like he's ignoring that like the dragon was a bad call to begin with
[03:57:27.640 --> 03:57:32.520]  And if we are gonna do that dragon we have to zone the fucking jungler because he has fucking it uh
[03:57:33.320 --> 03:57:35.320]  smite right so it's like
[03:57:36.520 --> 03:57:38.520]  Like what are you talking about?
[03:57:38.680 --> 03:57:44.360]  These players are crazy. It just feels to me like they're so angry at everything. It's kind of funny
[03:57:45.320 --> 03:57:50.360]  Okay, I got three items now I went for the pd because I kind of think the extra movement speed and the extra
[03:57:51.080 --> 03:57:53.080]  It'll help a lot
[03:57:54.280 --> 03:57:57.160]  I will say both the junglers are playing really well
[03:57:57.800 --> 03:57:59.800]  This game is like
[03:57:59.800 --> 03:58:01.000]  interesting
[03:58:01.000 --> 03:58:05.800]  Like both the assassin junglers are playing pretty well the enemy xeris playing pretty decent
[03:58:05.800 --> 03:58:07.800]  Oh
[03:58:10.840 --> 03:58:12.840]  What
[03:58:13.720 --> 03:58:18.440]  That is not a I I mean that was embarrassing like I don't even have words for that
[03:58:20.200 --> 03:58:22.360]  Like I genuinely don't have words for that shit
[03:58:24.440 --> 03:58:26.440]  I missed
[03:58:29.880 --> 03:58:33.000]  I can't see we have no vision man
[03:58:36.040 --> 03:58:38.040]  I
[03:58:41.080 --> 03:58:46.280]  We have no vision nothing's warded because the mumu didn't put any wards down
[03:58:49.480 --> 03:58:54.680]  So I can't fight because literally we're standing there in this area and there's nothing warded
[03:58:59.560 --> 03:59:03.720]  The best part is all mumu had to do was not die before that fight and we auto win
[03:59:04.280 --> 03:59:06.280]  Like we were winning so hard
[03:59:06.520 --> 03:59:09.960]  But this a mumu is actually solo losing us the game with this fucking ego
[03:59:11.000 --> 03:59:13.320]  God support players are so bad at league
[03:59:15.880 --> 03:59:17.880]  Actually
[03:59:19.400 --> 03:59:23.720]  And they'll deflect support players will will lie to themselves about how good they are
[03:59:24.040 --> 03:59:27.880]  And tell them that it's always their team's fault, but they'll drop nine deaths
[03:59:28.520 --> 03:59:33.320]  Have nine kp in a fucking 23 kill game and then blame their fucking team
[03:59:33.960 --> 03:59:35.960]  It's crazy
[03:59:44.680 --> 03:59:46.680]  Please ward things man
[03:59:54.440 --> 03:59:57.160]  Oh my god, he's dead again
[04:00:04.360 --> 04:00:08.360]  Guys, why are we up here top? Why are we top guys?
[04:00:15.240 --> 04:00:19.560]  Why are we three manning top right now? Holy crap
[04:00:21.240 --> 04:00:25.400]  My teammates are absolute apes like what am I watching men?
[04:00:28.200 --> 04:00:30.200]  They they just three man's top
[04:00:30.440 --> 04:00:33.800]  Oh my god
[04:00:38.120 --> 04:00:40.120]  Like these are the worst players I've ever fucking seen
[04:00:41.800 --> 04:00:43.800]  Like we we had the game in our hands
[04:00:44.360 --> 04:00:50.120]  And then all of a sudden my team's like, you know what I don't actually want to win and I'm like why and they're like well you see
[04:00:52.200 --> 04:00:54.600]  I have an ego and you're like, oh I see
[04:00:55.400 --> 04:00:58.040]  This is why I can't play ad carry in the silo. I'm sorry
[04:00:58.680 --> 04:01:02.920]  I can't I have to play support in the silo because ad carry is actually not playable
[04:01:05.080 --> 04:01:09.240]  When the entire game is decided by jungle support and mid
[04:01:10.440 --> 04:01:14.360]  Ad carry just does not decide any of the league of legends games below grandmaster
[04:01:14.920 --> 04:01:16.920]  Not one of them like last game
[04:01:17.160 --> 04:01:19.720]  We popped off and we won because we were the better ad carry, right?
[04:01:20.680 --> 04:01:22.680]  This game it doesn't matter
[04:01:22.760 --> 04:01:27.000]  Because tf does 11k damage doesn't ulti bot more than one time
[04:01:27.720 --> 04:01:29.720]  Like rengar did well
[04:01:29.720 --> 04:01:32.760]  nar did well, but they also had a horrible macro
[04:01:35.080 --> 04:01:41.560]  Like it is insane to me how easy support is as a role and just how dog shit every support player is on the server
[04:01:42.520 --> 04:01:45.000]  Like your role requires zero thought
[04:01:45.880 --> 04:01:47.880]  your thought when playing support
[04:01:48.440 --> 04:01:49.640]  is
[04:01:49.640 --> 04:01:51.640]  Do I get vision or not?
[04:01:51.960 --> 04:01:54.600]  If no, where can I be the most useful?
[04:01:55.560 --> 04:01:59.320]  Your thought should never be this game's over. My team sucks
[04:02:02.760 --> 04:02:04.760]  It drives me ludicrous
[04:02:08.200 --> 04:02:10.760]  Like I'm sorry that I have to play support on this account to climb
[04:02:11.080 --> 04:02:14.920]  But it's crazy how dog shit ad carry is when you're solo queuing and masters
[04:02:15.640 --> 04:02:19.720]  Like in in gm like if it's a full gm game ad carry is easy as fuck
[04:02:20.040 --> 04:02:24.120]  Like if everybody has a brain activity and they're not idiots ad carry is amazing
[04:02:24.520 --> 04:02:30.200]  Favorite role in the game when you're playing with people who don't know what they're doing and you're actively trying to climb and improve
[04:02:30.680 --> 04:02:36.600]  It genuinely feels like i'm pulling out a ball hair with my tweezers or pulling out my ball hairs with tweezers
[04:02:37.320 --> 04:02:39.320]  Like one by one
[04:02:39.320 --> 04:02:41.320]  It is so painful
[04:02:44.360 --> 04:02:46.360]  It's crazy
[04:02:46.360 --> 04:02:51.720]  Like let's take a look at this this support main right now
[04:02:53.000 --> 04:02:55.000]  97lp negative win rate, right?
[04:02:56.200 --> 04:03:02.200]  I could I could literally tell that he was not a good player in the first 30 seconds of that game
[04:03:07.320 --> 04:03:10.120]  I'm sorry i'm being mean but dude this has been driving me crazy
[04:03:10.680 --> 04:03:16.440]  Like look at the look at the support I had last game
[04:03:17.080 --> 04:03:20.520]  Also, can I ask a question? Why am I even allowed?
[04:03:21.400 --> 04:03:28.920]  Why am I even allowed to be in games with a challenger support one game? I win the game
[04:03:29.880 --> 04:03:34.040]  Then immediately it puts me in a game with a 97lp
[04:03:35.400 --> 04:03:37.400]  master support
[04:03:40.840 --> 04:03:42.840]  What is this matchmaking?
[04:03:47.800 --> 04:03:49.800]  This is insane
[04:03:54.520 --> 04:03:56.520]  That's crazy
[04:04:10.520 --> 04:04:21.080]  I I don't even I'm wondering why
[04:04:25.080 --> 04:04:28.280]  So I'm gonna go on a rant for a second why is this allowed?
[04:04:29.160 --> 04:04:34.440]  Why can you be in a game? Why can I be in a game with a literal guy who's about to promote to challenger?
[04:04:34.680 --> 04:04:41.800]  Right we win the game and then the very next game it puts me in a game with a guy who's 97lp
[04:04:44.760 --> 04:04:46.760]  This is insane
[04:04:46.760 --> 04:04:48.760]  So
[04:05:00.760 --> 04:05:06.280]  Sorry that's just frustrating as fuck because it's like such bad game design
[04:05:08.920 --> 04:05:11.880]  Right like that's that's 900 lp difference
[04:05:17.720 --> 04:05:20.920]  And the thing is this guy doesn't have good mmr
[04:05:22.200 --> 04:05:24.920]  Right like it's not it's not like this guy has good mmr
[04:05:26.200 --> 04:05:27.640]  right
[04:05:27.640 --> 04:05:29.320]  Because look at his games
[04:05:29.320 --> 04:05:35.640]  He's playing with all masters players. They're all like 100 lp masters 70 lp 30 lp, right?
[04:05:36.680 --> 04:05:39.480]  It doesn't make sense. It's not like his mmr is high
[04:05:39.880 --> 04:05:45.000]  So why is this guy getting into like a 600 lp grandmaster game?
[04:05:45.960 --> 04:05:50.680]  Why are we putting that guy in the game? That's so frustrating. So I just I needed events
[04:05:57.080 --> 04:06:02.360]  How do you know which ad carry pick in each situation? It's a lot of knowledge a lot of knowledge
[04:06:04.360 --> 04:06:06.360]  Well, you have to know
[04:06:06.840 --> 04:06:08.120]  A lot of shit
[04:06:08.120 --> 04:06:13.960]  Like what the enemy champions do what your champions need to do to win the game what the win cons are
[04:06:15.160 --> 04:06:18.840]  You can just pick if I'm being honest though, you could just pick uh
[04:06:21.480 --> 04:06:25.640]  Like there are ad carries in the current meta where you can just pick that are blind like I was making a tier list
[04:06:25.640 --> 04:06:27.080]  I forgot about it
[04:06:27.080 --> 04:06:29.720]  But I mean you can blind pick jinx pretty much every game
[04:06:31.160 --> 04:06:35.080]  Like jinx is just blindable every game pretty much. She's insane. She's super op
[04:06:36.120 --> 04:06:40.600]  So like if you if you ever just want to play a champion and you think like okay, I want to practice ad like jinx is insane
[04:06:41.080 --> 04:06:43.080]  Super good
[04:06:45.480 --> 04:06:50.920]  Draven's not blindable, but I do think he's really good if you're good at the game draven's very good
[04:06:52.120 --> 04:06:55.480]  He's he's he's harder than jinx by a mile like draven's a lot harder
[04:06:56.040 --> 04:06:59.560]  But he's definitely like good at carrying with only you as well
[04:07:01.720 --> 04:07:04.520]  Like another blindable ad that I think's like a tier is like varus
[04:07:05.320 --> 04:07:09.400]  You can blind pick varus really easily because varus doesn't really have counters
[04:07:10.360 --> 04:07:15.640]  Like he doesn't get countered by anything. He's more of like a you can pick him and then
[04:07:16.360 --> 04:07:21.240]  Go even and your ulti will always be useful. You can look to like win lane. You can look to like
[04:07:22.040 --> 04:07:24.040]  Engage things like that, right?
[04:07:39.560 --> 04:07:52.840]  Uh, okay, so this game uh as the support I need to be tracking the jungler
[04:07:55.080 --> 04:07:57.080]  So I'm gonna think where
[04:07:57.080 --> 04:08:02.440]  Always be thinking what the enemy jungler wants to accomplish and how to stop it. That's like a pretty big tip of advice
[04:08:02.440 --> 04:08:04.440]  I can give you guys
[04:08:05.160 --> 04:08:09.640]  Like think to yourself like okay, if I was the enemy jungler, what would I be wanting to do against this cramms, right as lisa?
[04:08:11.320 --> 04:08:14.760]  He's probably gonna want to either gank early like gank bot early or he wants to
[04:08:15.640 --> 04:08:17.640]  um
[04:08:17.640 --> 04:08:23.000]  Invade on certain timers right because that's like what lee is really good at is ganking and invading so
[04:08:25.080 --> 04:08:29.400]  What I think I'm gonna try to do this game is I'm gonna try and
[04:08:30.360 --> 04:08:34.360]  Watch for early ganks and early pressure bot lanes like your level two level three ganks
[04:08:35.240 --> 04:08:37.720]  Uh, we're still gonna be aggressive, but lux took tp
[04:08:38.280 --> 04:08:41.320]  Which means this lux does not plan on playing aggressive at all
[04:08:42.120 --> 04:08:44.920]  Like she she basically if anybody takes tp like this in a lane
[04:08:46.040 --> 04:08:49.560]  I already know from start of the game that they're not planning on doing anything
[04:08:49.960 --> 04:08:51.960]  So I'm probably gonna end up roaming a lot this game
[04:08:52.760 --> 04:08:54.760]  This is a this is gonna be a game where I roam a ton
[04:08:59.400 --> 04:09:01.400]  I
[04:09:09.000 --> 04:09:12.520]  We do have some good ways to roam too too like roaming top and med is both really good
[04:09:24.760 --> 04:09:26.760]  I just want her to ward early
[04:09:27.240 --> 04:09:30.200]  Because I don't want to get shit on badly
[04:09:31.720 --> 04:09:33.240]  So
[04:09:33.240 --> 04:09:35.240]  Okay, I'm just gonna flash immediately
[04:09:36.200 --> 04:09:40.280]  There's no reason to not flash there because alistar used this flash to get my flash
[04:09:40.840 --> 04:09:46.200]  Which is totally fine. It's better for him because he has hex flash, but it's not that bad
[04:09:50.680 --> 04:09:55.160]  Because I can outrange him and I can stay away from his his shit
[04:09:57.560 --> 04:09:59.560]  So we know he's in the bush. We just chill
[04:10:00.360 --> 04:10:02.520]  There it is. He fucked up now we go forward
[04:10:04.360 --> 04:10:08.200]  I don't know why lux isn't throwing spells at this guy like I don't know why she didn't cue him
[04:10:09.560 --> 04:10:11.640]  Like he fucked up the alistar should have died there
[04:10:13.320 --> 04:10:14.920]  And she's pinging me okay
[04:10:14.920 --> 04:10:19.000]  The alistar should have died there if alistar ever fucks up on a gauge like that where he hex flashes in
[04:10:19.560 --> 04:10:23.000]  Get stuck like cue his cooldown. Yeah, I don't know why it was thrown is what I'm saying
[04:10:23.560 --> 04:10:25.880]  You don't throw you don't throw spells that uh
[04:10:26.760 --> 04:10:28.760]  That aren't gonna land
[04:10:29.720 --> 04:10:33.240]  So there's no point in lux ever throwing her cue until alistar fucks up the combo
[04:10:34.120 --> 04:10:35.880]  Like she should just poke with e
[04:10:35.880 --> 04:10:39.880]  And then um because it's almost like a blitz hook right think of think of it like a blitz hook
[04:10:40.440 --> 04:10:45.720]  If she throws the uh the cue out right now they have an opportunity to be aggressive because they know
[04:10:46.280 --> 04:10:48.280]  The hook they know the the hook is down
[04:10:49.000 --> 04:10:52.120]  So it's better for her to just hold the hook essentially right
[04:10:53.080 --> 04:10:56.520]  Hold the cue and now when alistar does go in
[04:10:57.080 --> 04:11:02.360]  They have to be nervous about that cue because they can't just think oh the cue's down. Let's let's engage right
[04:11:02.760 --> 04:11:04.760]  So they can't actually think about that
[04:11:05.160 --> 04:11:07.160]  This is why I don't like
[04:11:11.160 --> 04:11:13.960]  A lot of the time doing this like push push the wave
[04:11:17.160 --> 04:11:21.080]  They can't engage on us without like flashing so it doesn't matter like look
[04:11:22.840 --> 04:11:24.840]  Oh
[04:11:25.160 --> 04:11:27.880]  Did she cue the wave again or am I an idiot?
[04:11:30.200 --> 04:11:32.600]  Like just oh man, I'm losing my mind here
[04:11:33.320 --> 04:11:35.320]  Oh these I'm I'm tilting
[04:11:35.560 --> 04:11:39.960]  It's fine. I need to not tilt. I need to just chill but I'm getting frustrated because we're like
[04:11:40.600 --> 04:11:44.120]  Not using cooldowns properly and it's driving me fucking crazy
[04:11:47.800 --> 04:11:51.320]  Because these are very simple things to do you guys got to walk the wave in by the way
[04:11:51.400 --> 04:11:54.360]  You can't let them freeze. Okay. They're very simple things to do
[04:11:54.360 --> 04:11:56.200]  I know I'm being annoying a shit whining about this
[04:11:56.200 --> 04:11:59.480]  But this is stuff that you you need to be thinking about when you're playing the game
[04:12:00.040 --> 04:12:02.040]  Well, you should actively be thinking
[04:12:02.200 --> 04:12:04.200]  Uh
[04:12:04.200 --> 04:12:08.440]  What can I do with my champions toolkit to stop their champions toolkit?
[04:12:09.160 --> 04:12:11.800]  And you should be thinking okay. I have cue right
[04:12:12.600 --> 04:12:18.120]  So what do they want to do they want to go in okay, and when you're thinking they want to go in
[04:12:21.320 --> 04:12:24.360]  Right, you should be thinking okay when they go in I can just cue
[04:12:25.160 --> 04:12:27.160]  And that should be your entire thought process
[04:12:27.720 --> 04:12:29.720]  Your thought process should never be
[04:12:30.840 --> 04:12:34.360]  Oh, maybe I can land a random cue at max range and we can get a kill
[04:12:37.080 --> 04:12:43.560]  She cued the wave yes, that's what I mean like you should never cue the wave unlocks either unless you're going to 100% reset
[04:12:45.720 --> 04:12:48.360]  That would be like if I hooked the wave as like blitzcrank or some shit
[04:12:48.840 --> 04:12:51.640]  Why is my locks bait pinging my graves?
[04:12:52.440 --> 04:12:55.720]  Dude, I gotta keep this 100 honest with you, man
[04:12:57.800 --> 04:13:01.000]  You don't get you you don't get to be mad here
[04:13:02.120 --> 04:13:04.120]  Why are dude these players are such babies
[04:13:07.720 --> 04:13:10.920]  Jesus christ what pussies man these people are such babies
[04:13:13.800 --> 04:13:16.040]  The graves played correctly by the way like 100%
[04:13:16.360 --> 04:13:19.560]  That he's mad at the graves for taking a wave
[04:13:19.960 --> 04:13:22.920]  He wanted to not like he wanted to be able to TP back and get the wave
[04:13:23.400 --> 04:13:28.040]  That's what this locks is so trash that she actually believes that's the graves faults
[04:13:28.520 --> 04:13:31.080]  That graves misplayed by pushing the bot wave
[04:13:31.800 --> 04:13:33.800]  But it was the right play
[04:13:34.440 --> 04:13:37.880]  Pushing the bot wave was the correct play there because then she doesn't have to TP
[04:13:38.360 --> 04:13:40.680]  The whole reason that he's pushing it is to save her teleport
[04:13:41.400 --> 04:13:43.400]  So that she doesn't have to TP to lane
[04:13:46.440 --> 04:13:51.000]  Players like this are why the game is hard to play right now in the current meta
[04:13:51.640 --> 04:13:53.160]  Why it feels bad?
[04:13:53.160 --> 04:13:58.200]  Because this locks is trash everybody you guys can all see this locks is terrible. She's already made a bunch of mistakes
[04:13:58.280 --> 04:14:00.760]  She's blaming her team. She's being a dipshit, right?
[04:14:01.720 --> 04:14:03.720]  but
[04:14:04.040 --> 04:14:06.360]  She can climb up to this elo being this bad
[04:14:09.720 --> 04:14:11.720]  Because of the system the current system in place
[04:14:16.280 --> 04:14:18.280]  Okay
[04:14:28.440 --> 04:14:31.240]  We should immediately do Baron here dragon. I mean we should do this
[04:14:35.000 --> 04:14:38.120]  Come you don't have time for this just come do dragon
[04:14:39.880 --> 04:14:42.280]  Bro the leasing just showed top we should be doing dragon
[04:14:46.920 --> 04:14:48.920]  When um
[04:14:57.400 --> 04:14:59.880]  When this shit happens by the way where you have um
[04:15:01.000 --> 04:15:07.160]  Enemy jungler shows on one side of the map you should always be playing on the other side of the map to make a counter play
[04:15:08.360 --> 04:15:12.940]  So jungler shows on top side we go for dragon, right easy
[04:15:16.600 --> 04:15:22.920]  Yo, be careful Alistar is going to be there. Zareth is going to be there. Just leave just leave leave of leaf
[04:15:25.160 --> 04:15:27.320]  I'll do it for you. I'll make you leave. I got you man
[04:15:29.960 --> 04:15:33.400]  But we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and um
[04:15:34.040 --> 04:15:36.760]  I need the back now, but we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back
[04:15:37.800 --> 04:15:39.800]  And not only did their bot lane have to back but
[04:15:41.560 --> 04:15:43.560]  The enemy was top
[04:15:46.040 --> 04:15:48.040]  I
[04:15:48.840 --> 04:15:50.840]  Tried man. I tried to flash Q him
[04:15:54.600 --> 04:15:59.720]  But yeah, it's it's really I don't know a lot of junglers don't I don't think they know what they're oh, I'm dead by the way
[04:16:00.440 --> 04:16:02.520]  I'm not even gonna pop exhaust. I'm just dead
[04:16:04.040 --> 04:16:09.240]  A lot of junglers don't know what the goal of the game actually is a lot of them think it's
[04:16:09.560 --> 04:16:14.600]  That was a bad insect but a lot of junglers think the goal of the game is to like get as much farm as you can and run over
[04:16:14.760 --> 04:16:18.520]  The enemy team and shit, but it's actually it is but it's also about like
[04:16:19.320 --> 04:16:23.400]  Getting early objectives and turning those small leads into big leads through objective control
[04:16:24.280 --> 04:16:26.280]  right
[04:16:26.600 --> 04:16:31.800]  So like right now I want to rotate top rift is up. I know lee sin's going to be on top side of the map right now
[04:16:32.360 --> 04:16:39.240]  I want to rotate top so that I can help my team by being in the top side of the map because that's where the next play is going to be made
[04:16:40.120 --> 04:16:42.120]  I
[04:16:43.720 --> 04:16:46.220]  Well the play's made mid, but I mean I'm here so it's fine
[04:16:53.400 --> 04:16:55.400]  Oh my god
[04:16:58.600 --> 04:17:04.940]  I did not think the fucking lee sin would be there too. Oh oops
[04:17:09.240 --> 04:17:11.320]  This is rough. I don't really know how to
[04:17:12.120 --> 04:17:15.160]  How to play this because I got there in time to counter the gank
[04:17:16.120 --> 04:17:17.160]  right
[04:17:17.160 --> 04:17:21.240]  I exhausted the guys saved the zereth. I got there in time to counter the gank but
[04:17:24.040 --> 04:17:26.040]  Oh well played
[04:17:27.000 --> 04:17:29.320]  That's actually mega well played
[04:17:31.160 --> 04:17:33.160]  That was really good
[04:17:34.520 --> 04:17:36.520]  I want to push this way then but I can't
[04:17:39.240 --> 04:17:41.240]  I
[04:17:45.240 --> 04:17:50.840]  Like uh, you guys are noticing there's no objectives taken on the map yet at 10 minutes, which is kind of crazy
[04:17:51.720 --> 04:17:55.400]  The alley's doing really good. The alice is not a bad support player. He's playing well
[04:18:04.600 --> 04:18:06.600]  Like he's playing very well
[04:18:10.200 --> 04:18:12.200]  I
[04:18:13.960 --> 04:18:17.960]  A lot of this is more of like I need I don't have anything to do on the map because uh
[04:18:18.920 --> 04:18:21.640]  I'm trying to help my jungler, but my jungler is trolling
[04:18:22.920 --> 04:18:24.920]  It's really rough
[04:18:25.080 --> 04:18:28.520]  Because like I'm trying to rotate over and help my jungler on cooldown basically right
[04:18:29.000 --> 04:18:34.120]  But my jungler doesn't want to fight you see like I'm countering the alicers fight or ganks. It's just
[04:18:39.960 --> 04:18:41.960]  I'm just dead
[04:18:44.520 --> 04:18:46.520]  Dude
[04:18:47.240 --> 04:18:53.400]  Like we shouldn't have made that play mid because we knew that they were all there and we knew that our jungler is doing this
[04:18:55.000 --> 04:18:57.000]  This might just be a jungle diff honestly
[04:18:58.920 --> 04:19:02.680]  Like our adc sucks, but it might just be a straight up jungle diff game. They do happen
[04:19:04.760 --> 04:19:08.280]  Especially in this elo where jungler has so much control of the game. They do happen
[04:19:09.640 --> 04:19:15.880]  It's a pretty big jungle diff chip hoppy, you know it I know it
[04:19:17.720 --> 04:19:22.840]  Like yeah, he's saying yeah, like he knows the jungle is getting out outclassed insanely hard
[04:19:25.880 --> 04:19:28.760]  Because graves counters leeson it's like a massive counter
[04:19:31.560 --> 04:19:33.560]  But this guy doesn't know what he's doing
[04:19:34.440 --> 04:19:39.960]  I think he's a rangar one trick and rangar got banned. I think that's what's going on
[04:19:41.240 --> 04:19:47.960]  It's a rangar one trick who got banned out and he tried to play a champion that requires thought not just a I jump you die champ
[04:19:49.320 --> 04:19:51.320]  Right and he just gets shit on for it
[04:19:56.840 --> 04:19:59.400]  I mean dude, I can't even I can't even do anything this game
[04:19:59.720 --> 04:20:03.960]  Our top lenders getting his ass whipped too. It's really fucking rough
[04:20:08.520 --> 04:20:13.000]  I mean he's in here. I'm pretty sure it's not it was just it was warded though
[04:20:14.440 --> 04:20:17.160]  I mean we can't really do anything here. I'm I'm dead. I think
[04:20:18.200 --> 04:20:20.200]  Yeah, I'm just dead
[04:20:20.600 --> 04:20:24.120]  This is just rough. I I kind of want to go next because I don't think
[04:20:25.240 --> 04:20:27.480]  I don't think we have the skill on the team to win
[04:20:29.480 --> 04:20:34.280]  The jungle death is huge the 80 death is huge and I'm just I can't I can't impact the map
[04:20:48.200 --> 04:20:51.400]  Like I can't I just can't do anything this game to impact the map and it feels really bad
[04:20:59.960 --> 04:21:01.960]  I
[04:21:02.760 --> 04:21:04.760]  Thought I'm a bitch. I should have flashed
[04:21:07.800 --> 04:21:11.160]  I got like creep walked a little bit when he knocked me in I like had to walk through I should just flashed up
[04:21:11.160 --> 04:21:15.400]  That's my man. Like what was that tp man? Oh god get me out
[04:21:16.360 --> 04:21:19.560]  I'm gonna be a hundred percent real get me out that tp was miserably bad
[04:21:20.520 --> 04:21:22.520]  Dude just tp'd to the wave
[04:21:30.360 --> 04:21:36.040]  Like what is our blocks doing to like I just feel like everybody's late to the fights
[04:21:37.800 --> 04:21:39.800]  Locks is always late to the fights
[04:21:40.360 --> 04:21:43.960]  The graves doesn't want to take fights even though he's playing graves and the Lee Sin
[04:21:44.920 --> 04:21:47.640]  Like I I feel like oh, this is rough. This is a rough game
[04:21:48.760 --> 04:21:50.760]  Games like this tilt me and I kind of just want to go next
[04:21:51.640 --> 04:21:55.800]  Because games like this I they are winnable, but I feel like I want to go next to save mental, you know
[04:21:56.920 --> 04:21:58.920]  Like low-key. I just want to save my mental
[04:22:00.120 --> 04:22:02.120]  I
[04:22:09.000 --> 04:22:11.000]  Because oh, that's so gross
[04:22:12.600 --> 04:22:16.840]  Like watching what lux did in the early stages of the lane phase just wasting her q on repeat
[04:22:17.240 --> 04:22:21.720]  That was one of the most embarrassing things ever and then like look at that. She just q'd a minion
[04:22:29.400 --> 04:22:31.400]  Oh
[04:22:36.760 --> 04:22:40.280]  Bro like oh my god, you gotta push the wave man
[04:22:44.280 --> 04:22:46.280]  Holy shits
[04:22:48.600 --> 04:22:50.600]  I mean I can't I can't even walk
[04:22:56.280 --> 04:22:58.280]  Oh my god
[04:22:59.080 --> 04:23:01.240]  I don't even have help from my fucking team
[04:23:02.920 --> 04:23:04.920]  That's the worst part about this
[04:23:06.120 --> 04:23:08.120]  Oh
[04:23:08.680 --> 04:23:11.720]  Dude these games feel so unplayable man
[04:23:13.720 --> 04:23:17.240]  Like I don't know how else to say it except for they just feel miserable to play
[04:23:20.280 --> 04:23:26.040]  Like I'm trying to focus on playing like improving myself, but it's so hard to know how to improve in games where like
[04:23:28.280 --> 04:23:31.320]  You genuinely just get no help
[04:23:36.680 --> 04:23:39.400]  My lux has been tilted since like minute two for some reason
[04:23:40.040 --> 04:23:44.120]  And my graves has been completely pathing wrong doing wrong shit
[04:23:44.920 --> 04:23:48.920]  It's hard to know how to help like I went mid to help countered two of the early ganks
[04:23:49.880 --> 04:23:51.880]  Lux still griefed the game
[04:23:53.560 --> 04:23:56.600]  So like yeah, it's just it's hard to know and then top lane lost
[04:23:58.840 --> 04:24:00.840]  It's so rough man
[04:24:06.040 --> 04:24:11.640]  Like I'm gonna keep it a hundred percent honest with you if you are a one trick do not try and play other champs
[04:24:13.480 --> 04:24:15.480]  You you will int
[04:24:18.680 --> 04:24:20.680]  You will play badly always and you will int
[04:24:21.640 --> 04:24:24.520]  And you will you will like look at this. This is
[04:24:25.400 --> 04:24:27.400]  2.9k damage as a
[04:24:27.880 --> 04:24:29.880]  Dude like what are we doing?
[04:24:33.640 --> 04:24:38.360]  How are these people getting into this elo? How does this locks like in the game?
[04:24:40.280 --> 04:24:47.720]  She was against an alistar bot and she did 1.2.9k damage in a 16 minute game
[04:24:48.440 --> 04:24:50.440]  Against a melee heavy team
[04:24:52.040 --> 04:24:54.040]  Like what is this what is happening?
[04:24:55.000 --> 04:24:58.680]  This guy was d4 30 lp last season
[04:25:01.320 --> 04:25:03.320]  And now he's magically in masters
[04:25:08.200 --> 04:25:11.720]  No, we need to fix matchmaking this is this is insane
[04:25:17.080 --> 04:25:19.400]  Like this is just a matchmaking diff it's nothing else
[04:25:20.680 --> 04:25:22.520]  my man literally
[04:25:22.600 --> 04:25:29.080]  Does not belong in master tier 400 lp mmr at all. Well, you can see that he's not at this level
[04:25:43.960 --> 04:25:46.120]  Dude I have the locks player on my team again
[04:25:48.920 --> 04:25:50.920]  Oh
[04:25:52.600 --> 04:25:58.840]  This is xerath one trick and a rangar one trick on the enemy team
[04:26:01.960 --> 04:26:06.520]  I don't know man. I guess I care more about the rangar than the xerath, but
[04:26:09.880 --> 04:26:11.880]  This is rough
[04:26:22.920 --> 04:26:27.480]  Oh, what's up tripopi dude, sorry I hit yes on that man. I know the game was winnable
[04:26:27.560 --> 04:26:32.440]  I'm gonna be real, but dude you didn't see what I saw during the early game of that game tripopi
[04:26:33.080 --> 04:26:35.080]  like man
[04:26:36.440 --> 04:26:38.760]  The entire early game of that game was like
[04:26:39.640 --> 04:26:41.480]  We lost lane
[04:26:41.480 --> 04:26:47.800]  Because locks wouldn't use her q to fight the alistar. She was using it to farm minions
[04:26:48.040 --> 04:26:52.200]  Like she was so scared of being engaged on by the alistar and the callista
[04:26:52.840 --> 04:26:56.120]  That she would use her q to max range farm minions
[04:26:56.840 --> 04:27:00.200]  Instead of save it. So when the alistar engages we just kill him
[04:27:01.800 --> 04:27:05.160]  Right because if alistar ever engages on me and lux he just gets killed
[04:27:05.640 --> 04:27:08.760]  We just bind him walk away and he's stuck there and he dies right?
[04:27:09.320 --> 04:27:11.320]  But for some reason
[04:27:12.840 --> 04:27:15.720]  She didn't understand how to do that so she was just throwing it to farm
[04:27:16.520 --> 04:27:22.120]  So we would just get engaged on so I started roaming and every time I was like roaming to an objective or something
[04:27:22.440 --> 04:27:25.480]  The graves would always walk away and not fight
[04:27:25.960 --> 04:27:29.640]  Like he wasn't attempting to fight. He was basically just like oh, I'm gonna go farm some more
[04:27:29.880 --> 04:27:33.560]  But I'm like dude you can't do that like if the alistar's ganking mid and I'm countering mid
[04:27:33.800 --> 04:27:38.200]  You can't just farm farm before coming mid or you can't just like not take dragon and shit like that right like
[04:27:38.680 --> 04:27:44.200]  It blows my mind that these players can get like it's like this guy too same thing like that jungler last game right?
[04:27:44.920 --> 04:27:48.600]  Look at this. It's the same thing as the last game like n.a. Is riddled with this shit
[04:27:48.680 --> 04:27:54.280]  And it's it's so miserable to play. Look at this this jungler last game, right? He's not he's what like a d1 player
[04:27:54.360 --> 04:27:56.360]  Right, he's not a bad player. He peeps d1
[04:27:56.440 --> 04:27:58.440]  But why is this guy in this game now?
[04:27:58.440 --> 04:28:02.280]  He like artificially inflated to the silo getting lucky with his first few games
[04:28:02.920 --> 04:28:06.040]  And now we have to play with this guy. Oh, it's an account share
[04:28:09.000 --> 04:28:13.240]  The person it's a different player look on the account
[04:28:14.920 --> 04:28:16.920]  D flash f flash
[04:28:18.440 --> 04:28:20.920]  So, uh, it's a fucking account share
[04:28:23.080 --> 04:28:25.080]  That's that's frustrating
[04:28:32.040 --> 04:28:35.080]  Sorry for whining so much guys this shit's just really frustrating to me
[04:28:36.680 --> 04:28:43.080]  Like I know I should play it to like specifically only care about like improving and then while you're improving you'll climb automatically and shit
[04:28:43.560 --> 04:28:45.560]  But it's really frustrating when like
[04:28:47.320 --> 04:28:51.320]  The players in the game would rather be idiots and assholes to each other than play the game
[04:28:51.800 --> 04:28:57.480]  Right like the game before the amumu right the game before this the amumu was just being toxic the whole game and into the win
[04:28:57.480 --> 04:29:02.760]  Away the last game the locks and the graves were being toxic to each other the whole game. We into the game away
[04:29:03.800 --> 04:29:05.800]  It's like I
[04:29:05.880 --> 04:29:11.320]  It's it's not fun to lose because one player gets mad at another player over them both being idiots
[04:29:13.320 --> 04:29:17.000]  I'm sorry. It's not fun. It's so unfun
[04:29:18.440 --> 04:29:21.000]  But we'll try and we'll try and win this one
[04:29:32.840 --> 04:29:39.640]  All we can really do is try and carry the games right? It's about it. What is
[04:29:43.160 --> 04:29:45.160]  I
[04:29:49.320 --> 04:29:51.320]  What
[04:29:52.120 --> 04:29:54.680]  What man, what what do you think they're gonna do to me?
[04:29:54.920 --> 04:30:01.080]  Welcome to the league of yo, thank you for the seven months man. Welcome back. I really don't want to meet all I don't
[04:30:01.240 --> 04:30:02.760]  I don't want to meet all
[04:30:02.760 --> 04:30:05.640]  Because like I I want to like value the penguins and shit, but dude
[04:30:13.400 --> 04:30:21.240]  Okay, I can make this one if they walk up I'm gonna flank them. That's why I'm standing here. Okay there in the main
[04:30:30.200 --> 04:30:34.920]  Only thing better than this one the mistake you made standing in its sights
[04:30:43.080 --> 04:30:45.080]  I
[04:30:53.320 --> 04:30:57.240]  That was a big cue I need to get level two first here 100%
[04:31:13.880 --> 04:31:15.880]  I
[04:31:16.520 --> 04:31:18.520]  Should have just been autoing there that whole time
[04:31:20.120 --> 04:31:22.920]  Because we have heal so she should have just walked up and autoed
[04:31:23.480 --> 04:31:28.360]  As soon as uh, this is what I mean by tracking cooldowns as soon as the niko missed her
[04:31:28.840 --> 04:31:30.840]  As soon as the niko missed her cooldown
[04:31:30.920 --> 04:31:32.680]  As soon as she missed her e
[04:31:32.680 --> 04:31:35.640]  The ash should have just walked up and immediately started fighting
[04:31:37.080 --> 04:31:39.080]  Right like because they can no longer kill us
[04:31:39.880 --> 04:31:43.960]  The uh niko doesn't actually have spells outside of her e
[04:31:44.840 --> 04:31:49.480]  Right, so if she misses that snare and she used her w too, right? So it's like we just go ham
[04:31:50.120 --> 04:31:52.120]  You don't need to be too scared
[04:31:53.640 --> 04:31:57.240]  It happens quite a bit sometimes where people will just be like really nervous
[04:32:02.360 --> 04:32:04.360]  It's fun
[04:32:09.160 --> 04:32:18.680]  Damn if I had dodged that cue I actually would have killed all three
[04:32:19.560 --> 04:32:20.680]  Damn
[04:32:20.680 --> 04:32:25.240]  I don't know if it was worth the flash after the guy. I actually I think it was if I had dodged the cue. I would have been fine
[04:32:26.360 --> 04:32:32.040]  So that was it's whatever. I also doesn't miss any creeps here. So it's not the end of the world
[04:32:32.840 --> 04:32:34.840]  I
[04:32:36.600 --> 04:32:39.480]  I'm pretty sure Lee Sin did not have his top camps by the way
[04:32:46.840 --> 04:32:51.320]  Damn if I was a little better mechanically I turned that by the way 100
[04:32:54.040 --> 04:32:57.480]  We should push this wave so that I can go get vision
[04:33:02.040 --> 04:33:04.040]  And I
[04:33:17.880 --> 04:33:20.280]  Is yeah that guy can't freeze that wave so
[04:33:23.400 --> 04:33:25.400]  Sounds too bad
[04:33:32.600 --> 04:33:34.600]  We since top
[04:33:44.920 --> 04:33:47.320]  You can kind of see some really good uh
[04:33:51.400 --> 04:33:54.600]  What is this why's my cart this afk turret?
[04:33:59.160 --> 04:34:01.160]  What is happening right now
[04:34:02.360 --> 04:34:04.360]  I
[04:34:13.880 --> 04:34:15.880]  Why was he afk
[04:34:26.200 --> 04:34:30.360]  I mean, I guess it worked out, but yeah, maybe you had to go let his cat out. I don't know
[04:34:32.760 --> 04:34:34.760]  Happens
[04:34:39.960 --> 04:34:45.320]  We do their bot lane is not very good. They're trying too hard to force fights that they can't win
[04:34:49.800 --> 04:34:52.520]  Like they they genuinely can't win half these fights that they're trying to force
[04:34:53.960 --> 04:34:57.080]  Maybe if they were against people who like don't push their buttons they could win those
[04:34:57.080 --> 04:34:59.720]  But it's like all I have to do is stand there and fight back and they lose
[04:35:00.680 --> 04:35:04.520]  They're on dragon a thousand percent right now. There's not a lot I can do about that
[04:35:06.040 --> 04:35:08.680]  Uh, we just have to chill there's almost nothing I can do about it
[04:35:09.320 --> 04:35:12.360]  Kai says trying to fake act like she's big but it's just
[04:35:15.960 --> 04:35:17.960]  There's just nothing we can do
[04:35:19.400 --> 04:35:21.880]  Because our cart this is top so we just chill
[04:35:21.880 --> 04:35:23.880]  I
[04:35:26.840 --> 04:35:31.000]  Finish the chair west no no no not yet. Whoa
[04:35:33.720 --> 04:35:35.720]  Uh leeson could be bot right now
[04:35:37.640 --> 04:35:41.960]  Hmm, I don't think it's too bad if he's bought though. They can't really dive us especially with card assaults
[04:35:52.360 --> 04:35:54.360]  I
[04:35:57.800 --> 04:35:59.800]  Why does my ash just run
[04:36:04.840 --> 04:36:07.880]  She like just straight up runs away it's kind of silly
[04:36:17.080 --> 04:36:21.640]  Because we have we have card this ulti like we can win that five or we can win a fight bot right now
[04:36:22.040 --> 04:36:24.040]  I
[04:36:25.720 --> 04:36:28.760]  Guess I guess I'm just gonna have to get them low enough for cart this to kill them
[04:36:30.520 --> 04:36:32.520]  Like without the ash's help
[04:36:33.880 --> 04:36:35.880]  Which I think I can do it's not too bad
[04:36:37.640 --> 04:36:42.200]  Okay, the acai's coming bot we just killed them. I mean let's just fight
[04:36:42.200 --> 04:36:44.200]  I
[04:36:50.920 --> 04:36:55.720]  Don't know why we just ash arrow honestly just ash arrow
[04:37:01.560 --> 04:37:03.560]  Okay, that was pretty bad ash arrow but
[04:37:04.520 --> 04:37:06.520]  I
[04:37:10.760 --> 04:37:13.640]  Filled uh, I don't think he's filled. I think he's just having a bad game
[04:37:15.240 --> 04:37:18.680]  I got it happens, you know, whoa, okay
[04:37:22.760 --> 04:37:24.760]  Do it ult me I fucking dare you
[04:37:29.400 --> 04:37:32.840]  I'm trying to keep some mana so that I can ulti
[04:37:33.960 --> 04:37:35.960]  I
[04:37:46.840 --> 04:37:48.920]  Oh, karthus already used his ults fuck
[04:37:55.480 --> 04:37:57.480]  They both backed there wow
[04:37:58.280 --> 04:38:00.280]  I
[04:38:01.960 --> 04:38:04.280]  My bad, I honestly didn't think they were both gonna back there
[04:38:06.920 --> 04:38:09.720]  Like I thought the kaisa was gonna back right where I saw her like last
[04:38:10.840 --> 04:38:13.400]  That was my bad. Hmm. I should be
[04:38:14.920 --> 04:38:16.920]  I think we sin can come bot here and kill me
[04:38:19.960 --> 04:38:21.960]  I should actually stop this guy's back
[04:38:22.040 --> 04:38:32.360]  Yeah, I should stop his back because it's more value to stop the back now even if leason isn't bot it's more value
[04:38:33.800 --> 04:38:35.800]  Because he's so low
[04:38:36.680 --> 04:38:38.680]  Collie is mia though, so we got to be care
[04:38:40.680 --> 04:38:46.920]  I wasted my ult though, which makes me kind of scared the other thing that kind of sucks about this is we don't have good vision
[04:38:52.840 --> 04:38:56.840]  And I can't really help anybody on the map because the same thing is happening as before
[04:38:57.720 --> 04:39:00.920]  We're like we're missing opportunities to get kills on timers
[04:39:04.280 --> 04:39:10.520]  I mean the dog lightning guy's playing fine this game. I think he's trolled a lot like he's he's trolling. This isn't like his best game
[04:39:11.480 --> 04:39:15.560]  But it's also I don't know why we're getting so tilted around the map right now
[04:39:16.440 --> 04:39:19.400]  Because if I'm if I'm being honest, we should just win the game off of like
[04:39:20.120 --> 04:39:22.120]  Being better players
[04:39:30.840 --> 04:39:33.640]  I don't know what this kart this is thinking but
[04:39:38.440 --> 04:39:39.480]  Do it do it it
[04:39:41.000 --> 04:39:42.680]  Cart this we can fight we can fight just fight
[04:39:45.560 --> 04:39:47.480]  Bro, what are we doing?
[04:39:50.360 --> 04:39:55.640]  I'm losing it man. Ah, no, no, no, I'm tilted. I'm tilted as fuck. He didn't walk in
[04:39:55.960 --> 04:39:58.680]  Just go on to the Akali shroud man
[04:40:00.120 --> 04:40:04.120]  Well, I just walk a foot to your right and stand on the Akali shroud
[04:40:04.600 --> 04:40:08.680]  She just eats your damage like while she's in the shroud. She can't stop that
[04:40:12.680 --> 04:40:14.680]  Holy shit, I'm losing my minds
[04:40:15.640 --> 04:40:20.280]  Like ash is just inting bot waves right now not trying to do anything
[04:40:21.320 --> 04:40:26.040]  Walks is really far up on cs which is really good, but I'm losing it man
[04:40:27.720 --> 04:40:30.280]  Like we see exactly where they are every game
[04:40:30.680 --> 04:40:36.120]  Like we see where everybody is on the enemy team permanently and we still can't manage to like walk to the right location
[04:40:37.080 --> 04:40:38.280]  This is driving me crazy
[04:40:38.440 --> 04:40:39.480]  This is driving me crazy
[04:40:42.040 --> 04:40:46.280]  My my car this 80 my car this jungles getting out farmed
[04:40:47.160 --> 04:40:49.480]  Like a car this jungles getting out farmed by a lisa in jungle
[04:40:50.040 --> 04:40:51.880]  That's insane
[04:40:51.880 --> 04:40:54.760]  Like I don't think I don't think I can stress enough how crazy that is
[04:40:57.640 --> 04:41:00.520]  Like there should never be a world where car this ever gets out farms
[04:41:05.640 --> 04:41:07.640]  No way
[04:41:07.720 --> 04:41:14.680]  I'm dead dude. No way. I just fucking ate the end of that now. I'm playing that just kill the lisa man
[04:41:24.440 --> 04:41:26.440]  I fucked up there
[04:41:27.160 --> 04:41:29.560]  That was my fault because I got hit by the tip of the
[04:41:30.040 --> 04:41:34.520]  That was my fault. I got barely clipped by the tip of the nico ults when I was trying to space because I'm bad
[04:41:35.480 --> 04:41:39.080]  And if I was alive there and I could have saved my flash for the lisa and q we just win
[04:41:41.480 --> 04:41:45.320]  I am confused that why we decided to like not fight that immediately though
[04:41:46.600 --> 04:41:49.880]  Like we caught out two of their members and we just got scared for whatever reason
[04:41:50.600 --> 04:41:52.600]  Wait, we win this fight
[04:41:52.600 --> 04:41:54.600]  We a thousand percent win this fight this fight this fight this
[04:42:05.240 --> 04:42:07.240]  I

[04:42:18.360 --> 04:42:22.840]  Oh my god, here we go I took one kill the guys about to lose his mind guys
[04:42:22.840 --> 04:42:24.840]  I
[04:42:31.880 --> 04:42:34.440]  Need to mute all I'm gonna mute all in a second
[04:42:35.960 --> 04:42:38.200]  Like I can't with these people right now
[04:42:41.240 --> 04:42:43.480]  Like I can't man you people are disgusting
[04:42:44.920 --> 04:42:46.920]  Like you guys just
[04:42:46.920 --> 04:42:51.400]  Wine you play bad you whine and you bitch about every little mistake that everything happens
[04:42:51.640 --> 04:42:55.080]  Even though it's like in the middle of a fight. I guarantee I'm a better player than you are
[04:42:55.480 --> 04:42:58.520]  And you're still whining and crying over one shutdown that like
[04:42:59.320 --> 04:43:05.320]  You didn't even walk to until I spam pinged you like I literally 1v2ed them you hit 1 e and now you're mad
[04:43:08.280 --> 04:43:11.000]  Dude I swear league players are fucking psychopaths
[04:43:15.640 --> 04:43:18.440]  At least I got the exhaust off surely she dies right
[04:43:19.240 --> 04:43:24.280]  Surely she dies here or not. Okay. Okay, at least she died
[04:43:26.200 --> 04:43:29.800]  Help each other guys help each other teamwork
[04:43:32.600 --> 04:43:34.600]  Teamwork teamwork teamwork teamwork
[04:43:39.640 --> 04:43:41.640]  Wait this ash is insane
[04:43:42.280 --> 04:43:51.080]  Okay, I'm not gonna lie that ash played that so good. I only saw the end of it and she still played that good
[04:43:52.760 --> 04:43:54.760]  That was sick
[04:43:55.160 --> 04:43:57.320]  Well well done. That was actually really good
[04:44:00.120 --> 04:44:03.000]  She almost stopped the dive that's crazy
[04:44:07.800 --> 04:44:10.840]  This game is definitely 1000% still winnable though
[04:44:11.640 --> 04:44:13.640]  We just have to play
[04:44:13.720 --> 04:44:19.400]  For late game and not lose our fucking minds. I'll let that push back into my ash. I'll go mid and get some vision
[04:44:22.440 --> 04:44:26.520]  That's pretty much all we have to do play for late and not lose our mind early
[04:44:32.040 --> 04:44:35.480]  We could play to kill the sacali right now she doesn't know there's no ward here
[04:44:37.080 --> 04:44:39.080]  We could also invade here
[04:44:41.880 --> 04:44:45.880]  Oh, that's so unlucky. That was such a close queue
[04:44:51.160 --> 04:44:53.160]  Kill that guy
[04:45:12.600 --> 04:45:14.600]  Jesus Christ
[04:45:19.560 --> 04:45:21.560]  I feel like we should have won that fight
[04:45:22.040 --> 04:45:24.040]  I felt like something awkward happened and we lost
[04:45:25.000 --> 04:45:31.640]  Did my ash just walk directly into the sacali and not use her ulti use your ulti you have ulti use your ulti
[04:45:32.520 --> 04:45:34.520]  Oh, oh my god
[04:45:42.040 --> 04:45:44.040]  What the fuck
[04:45:45.240 --> 04:45:47.240]  Oh, oh my god
[04:45:48.680 --> 04:45:52.520]  I don't even know what to say right now. This is insane
[04:45:54.520 --> 04:45:59.320]  This genuinely feels like everybody in the game is losing their mind in the freest game I've ever seen in my life
[04:46:03.880 --> 04:46:06.040]  Like that's what we're losing to right there that guy
[04:46:06.840 --> 04:46:09.960]  The guy who like doesn't understand how senna works
[04:46:10.680 --> 04:46:14.200]  Like that player that's why i'm frustrated like that player right there
[04:46:15.320 --> 04:46:17.320]  Has no idea how senna works
[04:46:17.560 --> 04:46:19.560]  tries to fight me
[04:46:19.560 --> 04:46:21.560]  And we're like losing to that guy
[04:46:21.720 --> 04:46:25.720]  Like i'm trying really hard not to be an asshole, but like it's flooding out right now from these games
[04:46:28.120 --> 04:46:30.120]  It's crazy
[04:46:32.520 --> 04:46:37.240]  Like he's so toxic look at this he went proto belt. I only a boot
[04:46:39.960 --> 04:46:43.320]  Nico but like what that doesn't do anything to help his team
[04:46:59.080 --> 04:47:04.600]  You could arrow that guy I mean it's not impossible or don't that's fine
[04:47:09.960 --> 04:47:11.960]  Oh
[04:47:16.280 --> 04:47:18.280]  My god
[04:47:23.080 --> 04:47:25.080]  Guys I think my luck since afk
[04:47:28.040 --> 04:47:30.040]  She's been sitting in base for like five minutes
[04:47:30.360 --> 04:47:32.360]  I
[04:47:36.680 --> 04:47:42.040]  Think she's like it literally just rolling there some fits. All right, let's push this wave
[04:47:53.480 --> 04:47:55.480]  We could make a pick right now
[04:48:00.360 --> 04:48:03.320]  Jax what are you doing man? Why are you up there? Oh, no
[04:48:05.640 --> 04:48:08.760]  Also, why does this ash have the worst build I've ever seen?
[04:48:15.880 --> 04:48:18.760]  Dude if we lose to the kaisa that just did that i'm gonna lose my mind
[04:48:30.200 --> 04:48:32.200]  I
[04:48:35.320 --> 04:48:40.920]  Like I just blind art in without any vision of anybody and just died there's no way we can lose this
[04:48:44.520 --> 04:48:46.520]  We got this guys just play
[04:48:49.080 --> 04:48:51.960]  Like I just need to I need help getting vision control on baron
[04:48:52.840 --> 04:48:54.840]  And mid and then we can we can win
[04:48:55.560 --> 04:48:57.560]  We got this
[04:48:57.560 --> 04:49:00.040]  Jesus christ
[04:49:28.440 --> 04:49:30.440]  I
[04:49:44.040 --> 04:49:46.040]  Right now
[04:49:57.560 --> 04:49:59.560]  I
[04:50:16.520 --> 04:50:18.760]  Mean we still got baron, but he did get two of them. I guess
[04:50:21.320 --> 04:50:23.320]  Or no, we only yeah, you got card this an ash
[04:50:24.680 --> 04:50:26.680]  But we did get baron, which is very nice
[04:50:27.480 --> 04:50:29.480]  So
[04:50:33.720 --> 04:50:36.520]  I'm gonna go doms this game normally go
[04:50:39.160 --> 04:50:41.160]  Black cleaver, but I think I'm gonna go doms
[04:50:42.120 --> 04:50:57.400]  I need to get vision control on dragon and mid
[04:50:57.400 --> 04:50:59.400]  I
[04:51:10.760 --> 04:51:16.040]  Need to get vision control and I need I need help to do it though. I'm gonna act like I'm backing here
[04:51:23.960 --> 04:51:26.600]  We should just be pushing mid with baron. I don't know what we're doing
[04:51:28.360 --> 04:51:31.400]  Like like low key it should just be straight up like we go mid with baron here
[04:51:43.000 --> 04:51:45.000]  The fuck was that that was a terrible play
[04:51:58.360 --> 04:52:00.360]  Kill him twice
[04:52:02.120 --> 04:52:04.120]  Guys just just come in we have baron
[04:52:13.960 --> 04:52:18.600]  Nice huge pick push mid push mid fuck dragon just push mid
[04:52:19.480 --> 04:52:21.480]  Okay
[04:52:25.720 --> 04:52:27.720]  Okay, now we back off
[04:52:31.160 --> 04:52:34.520]  Oh, I mean that was bad
[04:52:37.640 --> 04:52:42.200]  Guys back off back off back off leave leave leave leave leave please please just leave
[04:52:42.920 --> 04:52:49.320]  You can leave you can leave we just go do dragon leave
[04:52:53.240 --> 04:52:55.960]  We still have so much gold to get on the map we can go get bot tier two
[04:52:56.920 --> 04:52:58.920]  bot tier one bot tier two
[04:52:59.240 --> 04:53:03.240]  We have we have so much gold to get on the map. It's not a big deal right like we don't need to end the game right the second
[04:53:04.040 --> 04:53:06.040]  We actually have carthus and we have
[04:53:07.800 --> 04:53:09.800]  Jax too so like our scaling is really good
[04:53:12.200 --> 04:53:14.200]  I
[04:53:39.960 --> 04:53:41.960]  Need to go get
[04:53:42.280 --> 04:53:44.280]  I
[04:53:52.600 --> 04:53:56.280]  Need to go get my next item but I need enough gold to do it
[04:53:58.840 --> 04:54:00.840]  I also need to go get wards
[04:54:01.000 --> 04:54:04.600]  This sucks. I'm on like a weird buy timer where like I don't have enough things to get
[04:54:05.400 --> 04:54:07.400]  You know what? I'm just gonna get my ward item
[04:54:08.200 --> 04:54:11.160]  I'm gonna grab this for right now just so we can actually get some power on the map
[04:54:12.200 --> 04:54:16.920]  Because the map's so dark and I I think getting the ward item before finishing my last whisper items probably the smartest call
[04:54:22.360 --> 04:54:26.600]  I am a little concerned why we're not pushing bot with Jax. We're pushing top
[04:54:28.600 --> 04:54:34.360]  And i'm also concerned why we're not uh playing for mid prio and we're just farming bot side
[04:54:36.040 --> 04:54:38.040]  This is such an awkward fucking thing
[04:54:43.080 --> 04:54:46.920]  Like we should just be playing for mid prio and use arrow to engage
[04:54:47.560 --> 04:54:52.360]  That's how we win. We just use arrow to engage when they contest mid. It's actually that easy
[04:54:59.560 --> 04:55:01.560]  Like low key it's actually that easy
[04:55:08.200 --> 04:55:10.200]  See watch now this guy's dead
[04:55:12.760 --> 04:55:14.760]  I
[04:55:17.720 --> 04:55:22.440]  Mean that's fine with me you guys want to int to kill me that's totally fine
[04:55:36.040 --> 04:55:40.840]  They can get the inhib and then they can back up. Yeah, yeah getting him back up
[04:55:42.280 --> 04:55:44.280]  And then play for play for baron
[04:55:46.840 --> 04:55:51.400]  They'll only have a few seconds to do this though. So it's kind of scary because these two are gonna be alive
[04:55:57.480 --> 04:55:59.480]  They need to back immediately
[04:56:03.880 --> 04:56:06.040]  Just reset you don't need the wave just leave leave leave
[04:56:06.760 --> 04:56:09.000]  Baron's up. Baron's up. Think about the macro guys the macro
[04:56:10.120 --> 04:56:12.120]  We play for baron now
[04:56:12.760 --> 04:56:20.120]  Because there's a timer now where like you guys just need to reset because there's a timer where the enemy has tempo on the map
[04:56:20.680 --> 04:56:22.680]  and if we don't
[04:56:23.000 --> 04:56:25.000]  If we don't allow
[04:56:25.640 --> 04:56:28.440]  If we don't reset they'll just rush baron and there's nothing we can do about it
[04:56:28.520 --> 04:56:46.680]  Okay, they're not on baron. I think they missed their timer. They're on it. No, they're on it. They're on it. They're on it. Okay, they're not on it. We're fun
[04:56:53.080 --> 04:56:55.080]  We can still fight this though, but we need everybody here
[04:56:58.760 --> 04:57:00.760]  Just
[04:57:02.520 --> 04:57:04.520]  Arrow arrow ash arrow arrow
[04:57:05.240 --> 04:57:07.240]  Arrow it doesn't matter if you hit mouth just arrow
[04:57:07.800 --> 04:57:09.800]  Just arrow him. Thank you
[04:57:16.200 --> 04:57:18.200]  No, no guys the back line the back line
[04:57:21.080 --> 04:57:23.080]  Play together play together. Yes
[04:57:25.480 --> 04:57:27.480]  Nice
[04:57:28.920 --> 04:57:30.920]  End of the game
[04:57:32.280 --> 04:57:34.280]  You end you end here
[04:57:34.680 --> 04:57:36.520]  Lux don't back
[04:57:36.520 --> 04:57:40.520]  You are giving me cancer. Okay, they forfeit it dude. Look how easy that is
[04:57:40.920 --> 04:57:47.240]  Look how easy it is to win games when people are listening to macro. Look how easy it is. Oh my god
[04:57:49.080 --> 04:57:53.560]  I'm losing it man. I swear to god. I'm losing my hair. I could feel my hair falling out right now
[04:57:53.560 --> 04:57:57.960]  I can feel it falling out of my fucking head like I just lost the one that's right there. Look
[04:57:58.520 --> 04:58:00.200]  It's just
[04:58:00.200 --> 04:58:02.200]  Fucking kill me man
[04:58:02.280 --> 04:58:04.280]  In game god
[04:58:04.680 --> 04:58:10.040]  It's so hard. I feel so exhausted. Like it's so exhausting
[04:58:15.000 --> 04:58:19.560]  You played a 44 minute gold game god damn, that's impressive
[04:58:23.480 --> 04:58:26.600]  I don't want to honor any of these people who would you guys honor?
[04:58:27.560 --> 04:58:32.760]  Like out of all of them, who'd you guys pick because I don't know they all in my eyes. I'm too toxic right now. They all suck
[04:58:36.200 --> 04:58:38.200]  Jax, all right, I'll give it to Jax
[04:58:40.120 --> 04:58:43.000]  Ash ash was trying I'll give you that ash was trying
[04:58:46.760 --> 04:58:52.440]  Dude look at this lux this lux got so fucking carried. Oh my god
[04:58:57.320 --> 04:59:04.600]  Oh my god, don't type to me you pedestrian
[04:59:08.760 --> 04:59:10.760]  This man called him a pedestrian
[04:59:19.240 --> 04:59:21.240]  That's not even an insult
[04:59:21.880 --> 04:59:25.720]  Like oh, yeah. Yeah. Wow fucking pedestrian like
[04:59:26.600 --> 04:59:28.600]  I
[04:59:30.040 --> 04:59:32.040]  It's not even an insult man
[04:59:47.880 --> 04:59:52.920]  Dude guys I feel like part of my life gets taken away, you know
[04:59:53.640 --> 04:59:57.960]  Like when I play in my main account and I'm like super sweaty tryharding and shit
[04:59:58.280 --> 05:00:01.880]  I feel like I feel like I'm losing like yeah, it's like it's like every time I lose
[05:00:01.960 --> 05:00:04.760]  It's like one hair or like every time I'm like barely win
[05:00:05.160 --> 05:00:10.600]  Right, it's just like every game in this elo is like one hair on my head gets fucking burnt out and it just leaves
[05:00:10.920 --> 05:00:12.920]  And I'm not like I'm gonna be like Homer Simpson
[05:00:23.640 --> 05:00:25.640]  Like
[05:00:33.320 --> 05:00:37.560]  Look at the difference in wards placed. This is what annoys me about bad support players
[05:00:38.360 --> 05:00:40.360]  This guy placed 23
[05:00:41.240 --> 05:00:44.920]  He's more focused on getting kills than placing wards and it's really stupid
[05:00:45.000 --> 05:00:57.160]  Sorry, I just don't listen. I don't have anything against the dog lightning guy as a person other than like what I've seen on his stream
[05:00:57.560 --> 05:01:01.720]  Right like on his stream. He just seems really egotistical
[05:01:03.160 --> 05:01:08.600]  Like he's he's like everything I hate in the average league player. He's he has a massive ego
[05:01:09.560 --> 05:01:13.320]  Because he reached challenger on the support role on like an off meta pick
[05:01:13.800 --> 05:01:17.240]  Like last year at some point or something or maybe he's challenger right now. I don't even know
[05:01:17.800 --> 05:01:19.800]  Maybe he has an account in challenger. I don't even know
[05:01:20.520 --> 05:01:22.600]  but it drives me crazy because like
[05:01:24.760 --> 05:01:29.000]  He doesn't do anything correctly like he gets away with such dumb shit
[05:01:29.800 --> 05:01:34.280]  Because he like he like basically wins lane because he plays extremely aggressively
[05:01:35.000 --> 05:01:37.000]  But if you guys noticed in that game
[05:01:37.080 --> 05:01:41.800]  The reason we won lane or we were able to push back is because they they played aggressively
[05:01:41.800 --> 05:01:46.440]  But they did it really stupidly like they were fighting us in our own waves
[05:01:47.160 --> 05:01:49.720]  Right like on repeat. They were just fighting us in our own waves
[05:01:50.200 --> 05:01:53.720]  Every time I would just turn a one for one almost a one for two every time
[05:01:54.280 --> 05:01:56.200]  And it's it's stupid because every time that's happening
[05:01:56.200 --> 05:02:02.040]  They're also giving me souls right and he would like take weird fights and like I know he's probably forth-bunny and he doesn't care
[05:02:02.200 --> 05:02:06.120]  It's a smurf blah blah blah, but I just don't like when people like that like ego their ass off
[05:02:07.160 --> 05:02:09.160]  When they play so badly
[05:02:09.720 --> 05:02:11.720]  It drives me crazy
[05:02:15.320 --> 05:02:18.520]  Why do I care so much I don't know I don't know
[05:02:32.040 --> 05:02:34.040]  How you guys doing by the way
[05:02:34.600 --> 05:02:37.640]  How's everybody's day going in chat? What you guys up to talk to me?
[05:02:38.360 --> 05:02:42.920]  I know I stopped like teaching the game and started whining like I got on my main account a few hours ago
[05:02:43.240 --> 05:02:45.640]  And I stopped teaching and I started whining a bunch. So
[05:02:48.040 --> 05:02:50.040]  My bad
[05:02:52.040 --> 05:02:54.040]  My bad on that one dudes
[05:02:54.040 --> 05:02:56.040]  How you guys doing now? How's everybody's day going?
[05:02:56.040 --> 05:02:58.040]  How's everybody's day going?
[05:02:58.040 --> 05:03:00.040]  How's everybody's day going?
[05:03:00.200 --> 05:03:02.200]  How you guys doing now? How's everybody's day going?
[05:03:09.480 --> 05:03:12.760]  When the coaching service is open oh, I could probably do coaching
[05:03:13.880 --> 05:03:15.880]  at some point soon
[05:03:15.960 --> 05:03:22.040]  Like I'd be willing to do some coaching some like sub coaching or something or like something like that. It might be fun
[05:03:30.600 --> 05:03:34.760]  So I mean bronze you don't get enough time to actually improve dude. I feel that man
[05:03:35.080 --> 05:03:37.320]  It takes a long time. Well, he is not an easy game to
[05:03:37.880 --> 05:03:42.520]  Pick up and start playing right like if you're if you're in bronze or silver and you're like, oh, I actually you know
[05:03:42.520 --> 05:03:44.520]  I'm having fun playing the game. I kind of want to try and get better
[05:03:45.160 --> 05:03:49.000]  It's you're just overwhelmed with so much info that you like have to play so many games
[05:03:50.200 --> 05:03:52.200]  Right like I feel you man
[05:03:55.400 --> 05:03:57.400]  Like it's it's overwhelming
[05:04:00.760 --> 05:04:07.240]  Yeah, I I feel you
[05:04:16.040 --> 05:04:20.200]  Well, we got mid okay, uh should I just play trust?
[05:04:23.000 --> 05:04:26.120]  I'm worried if I picked trust that we won't have ap but
[05:04:27.000 --> 05:04:29.320]  I also think I'm better at trust than I am at like
[05:04:30.120 --> 05:04:32.120]  other stuff
[05:04:32.120 --> 05:04:34.120]  So, I don't know
[05:04:39.800 --> 05:04:44.600]  Ap Varus, I'm not good enough at ap Varus man. I'm gonna be real
[05:04:47.560 --> 05:04:51.160]  Well, my mouse is good, but the problem with mouse is like mouse is a shitty champion
[05:04:52.040 --> 05:04:54.040]  like mouse is trash right so like
[05:04:54.360 --> 05:04:59.880]  He's good, but he's like not good in the sense of like I can play him well
[05:05:00.760 --> 05:05:03.160]  But at the end of the day if they pick something that like
[05:05:04.360 --> 05:05:06.360]  counters mouths, I just lose
[05:05:08.920 --> 05:05:10.920]  Or is like Tristana is just free to pick
[05:05:12.120 --> 05:05:17.880]  Like even if we play all ad right like let's say we do all ad or some shit like on accidents or because people are one tricks
[05:05:17.880 --> 05:05:24.120]  Blah blah blah it's it's still free like Tristan is still like a good pick because even with all ad
[05:05:24.360 --> 05:05:26.360]  She's still like you can build lord doms
[05:05:26.920 --> 05:05:31.560]  She has incredibly high pressure early game if you play her right right like you could push the waves roam
[05:05:32.200 --> 05:05:37.160]  Uh, you can you can roam top roam bot help lanes out like level 2 3 you can invade junglers early
[05:05:37.560 --> 05:05:39.560]  Like she's just incredibly incredibly strong
[05:05:41.640 --> 05:05:43.640]  This guy should go pike
[05:05:44.040 --> 05:05:49.400]  I was gonna say they picked new new and I picked an ad mid they picked new new and thresh
[05:05:50.360 --> 05:05:52.360]  We should have an engage
[05:05:52.360 --> 05:05:57.640]  Because because pike Trist like I can just walk bot on repeat now and pretty much kill people
[05:06:07.960 --> 05:06:12.040]  Watch an iron game watching an iron game I feel like it wouldn't be an actual iron game though, would it?
[05:06:14.600 --> 05:06:18.360]  I've heard I had friends who like intentionally lost a bunch of games
[05:06:19.800 --> 05:06:21.800]  Uh
[05:06:21.960 --> 05:06:28.600]  And so they could get to iron four right they like they like into down to iron four or whatever to see if they could make it and
[05:06:30.920 --> 05:06:34.120]  Uh, there's just so many like smurfs in iron
[05:06:36.200 --> 05:06:38.920]  There's like legitimate bot bot accounts
[05:06:40.680 --> 05:06:42.680]  Like like accounts that are like being boted
[05:06:43.640 --> 05:06:47.160]  Right there's like bot of the counts and iron. There's like smurfs all over the place
[05:06:55.800 --> 05:07:00.120]  It seems to have stopped I wonder if riot like did something that stopped the bots
[05:07:01.720 --> 05:07:05.640]  They must they may have like they may have just think incorporated something that like stops the software
[05:07:06.120 --> 05:07:08.120]  I
[05:07:09.720 --> 05:07:15.800]  But I don't know I haven't heard anything about it, but I have no clue. I'll be real. I don't know
[05:07:36.360 --> 05:07:38.360]  You
[05:07:39.880 --> 05:07:41.880]  You had to take fall you around last game I got boots one
[05:07:43.720 --> 05:07:45.720]  Dude that sounds awful
[05:07:49.000 --> 05:07:52.680]  I kind of feel bad for actual iron players who are like
[05:07:54.440 --> 05:07:58.440]  In iron trying to climb because like that sounds bad
[05:08:06.440 --> 05:08:08.440]  I
[05:08:12.840 --> 05:08:16.920]  Do think you can climb obviously out of any elo doesn't matter right like if I were to go into an iron game
[05:08:16.920 --> 05:08:18.920]  I'd probably drop like 50 kills
[05:08:20.840 --> 05:08:24.760]  But I so I do think you can climb out of any you know any elo for sure
[05:08:35.960 --> 05:08:43.800]  You love only new account if you this guy had a bot of account that answered every time I rub bot
[05:08:50.840 --> 05:08:52.840]  That's funny
[05:08:59.800 --> 05:09:01.480]  Yeah, I assume that's a good point
[05:09:01.480 --> 05:09:06.680]  I guess if you're in iron you could like play to learn the game a bit better and then you could like play a new account and see
[05:09:06.680 --> 05:09:08.680]  Where you got yeah, I know that would work
[05:09:09.880 --> 05:09:11.880]  That makes sense
[05:09:17.080 --> 05:09:20.200]  Sure, I'll first pick man I'll first pick Senna
[05:09:23.080 --> 05:09:29.560]  I I guarantee they walk in fucking these people are gonna walk in fucking uh, not unless there's some shits
[05:09:30.520 --> 05:09:33.080]  It'll be like Jarvan not unless
[05:09:36.600 --> 05:09:38.600]  I don't even know
[05:09:43.080 --> 05:09:45.880]  Ribbon's not too bad for Senna, so it's okay. Don't get flanks
[05:09:45.880 --> 05:09:49.640]  I actually don't think ribbons too bad right now. Maybe all the ribbon players I played against suck
[05:09:49.800 --> 05:09:51.800]  But I don't think she's actually that bad
[05:09:52.120 --> 05:09:57.720]  I think ribbons like just you have to position well. I think ribbons really broken at abusing positioning
[05:09:58.520 --> 05:10:00.520]  That's why she's so good. It's all a cue
[05:10:00.760 --> 05:10:03.880]  Like good ribbon players all get really gross flanks
[05:10:04.600 --> 05:10:09.320]  And the flanks are what's op. Yeah, there's the Gragas. Okay. I was like they're gonna pick something to fuck me over
[05:10:11.400 --> 05:10:14.840]  This guy picked Gragas, but it was gonna be like j4 or Gragas or something
[05:10:16.040 --> 05:10:18.360]  And then this guy is the support. He'll probably pick Nautilus
[05:10:20.120 --> 05:10:22.120]  Unless he's a one trick
[05:10:22.600 --> 05:10:26.520]  Right like unless this guy's straight up just like a one trick. He'll pick like Nautilus or some shits
[05:10:28.200 --> 05:10:31.240]  Maybe Rakan. Rakan or Nautilus
[05:10:35.400 --> 05:10:37.640]  Because if he picks an enchanter we just win the game
[05:10:41.880 --> 05:10:43.880]  He has to pick engage
[05:10:47.400 --> 05:10:49.400]  Milio would be really good here too actually
[05:10:51.000 --> 05:10:56.680]  Because Milio would counter half our team you can milio q wukong and ken and engage
[05:10:58.600 --> 05:11:01.160]  Like if this guy played milio, this would actually be a hard land
[05:11:03.640 --> 05:11:05.640]  Tom kinsh
[05:11:08.280 --> 05:11:10.920]  I mean I I get it, but I think it's bad
[05:11:12.920 --> 05:11:14.920]  Runes oh shit
[05:11:15.400 --> 05:11:18.520]  Yo, you just saved me looking like an absolute fool
[05:11:19.400 --> 05:11:21.400]  Thank you
[05:11:21.560 --> 05:11:24.680]  Holy crap if you wanted to see my runes there here, but thank you you reminded me
[05:11:24.680 --> 05:11:28.440]  Here I'm gonna be over here. I'm gonna get some water. I'll be right back get some agua
[05:11:54.680 --> 05:12:10.440]  By the way the people who are here to watch me play ad carry I sincerely apologize
[05:12:11.480 --> 05:12:15.640]  I know watching me play Senna is probably boring as fuck
[05:12:19.160 --> 05:12:21.160]  Okay, I know
[05:12:24.840 --> 05:12:29.240]  And I promise you we will play ad carry at some point I promise you
[05:12:29.960 --> 05:12:33.080]  I played like the first four hours of the stream was ad carry or the first three
[05:12:33.640 --> 05:12:37.160]  Right, I played on my smurf for a few games and played some ad so if you want to watch that you can go back in the
[05:12:37.160 --> 05:12:39.160]  Bod we did some my commentary and shit
[05:12:40.360 --> 05:12:41.480]  uh
[05:12:41.480 --> 05:12:45.240]  The only reason I'm playing so much senna and support on this account is because like
[05:12:46.520 --> 05:12:51.160]  There the the elo I'm currently in is like the worst elo to climb in solo queue because of
[05:12:52.120 --> 05:12:54.120]  a lot of factors and
[05:12:54.680 --> 05:12:57.160]  Support has some of the highest impact on the game
[05:12:59.480 --> 05:13:05.880]  Whereas like ad carry has high impact late, but in in solo queue you want to have high impact early and I wanted to be able to uh
[05:13:06.840 --> 05:13:08.840]  Impact the game really early on
[05:13:25.240 --> 05:13:32.840]  So yeah, sorry about being you know boring and shit
[05:13:40.680 --> 05:13:42.680]  I just really want to like win games
[05:13:44.280 --> 05:13:45.320]  At least on this accounts
[05:13:45.320 --> 05:13:50.280]  I want to get out of the silo because the faster I get out of the silo the the faster um
[05:13:55.240 --> 05:13:57.240]  I
[05:14:01.400 --> 05:14:03.560]  The faster I get out of the silo the faster I can
[05:14:05.320 --> 05:14:07.480]  Have fun playing ad carry and like trying climb
[05:14:09.480 --> 05:14:11.480]  What a weird
[05:14:11.720 --> 05:14:16.440]  Like what a weird play by these guys. What the fuck? They like half shoved the waves
[05:14:19.160 --> 05:14:22.360]  To get like early bush control and then they do shit like that
[05:14:24.840 --> 05:14:26.840]  I
[05:14:32.360 --> 05:14:34.360]  This guy's just dead i'm gonna give it to twitch
[05:14:38.520 --> 05:14:40.280]  Nice we got his exhaust
[05:14:40.280 --> 05:14:44.520]  So I wasted my exhaust there. I did it because I thought the jinx was gonna insta flash
[05:14:46.600 --> 05:14:48.600]  Like I didn't exhaust because I was like scared of her damage
[05:14:49.480 --> 05:14:53.080]  I did it because I thought she was gonna like uh try and flash away the second that's
[05:14:54.920 --> 05:14:59.720]  Uh, but I I landed my snare. It was kind of bad by me. I mean I landed my snare. So I didn't need to exhaust her
[05:14:59.720 --> 05:15:01.720]  I just was like, oh, maybe she'll flash
[05:15:01.960 --> 05:15:03.960]  She did not she did not flash
[05:15:05.400 --> 05:15:08.440]  What do you know is this this 500 LP masters 400 LP
[05:15:09.960 --> 05:15:11.960]  It's insane. I know
[05:15:12.600 --> 05:15:14.600]  Absolutely crazy
[05:15:25.320 --> 05:15:27.320]  I
[05:15:35.560 --> 05:15:40.280]  Put that ward there because gregas is probably bot, you know, so
[05:15:48.680 --> 05:15:50.840]  They're trying to come up from bot to kill me here
[05:15:51.800 --> 05:15:55.080]  Like they're bot lanes rotating up to try and kill me
[05:15:56.680 --> 05:15:58.680]  so
[05:15:59.080 --> 05:16:01.080]  Just be careful twitch. They're they're in here, man
[05:16:02.600 --> 05:16:04.840]  I actually have to back and walk look
[05:16:12.760 --> 05:16:17.880]  This is hilarious the enemy bot lane literally is roaming mid look at this. What?
[05:16:18.520 --> 05:16:20.520]  I
[05:16:24.680 --> 05:16:27.160]  I'm not trying to soak his xp. I just want those souls
[05:16:31.000 --> 05:16:33.160]  I'm scared to walk in here. I don't know where gregas is
[05:16:33.160 --> 05:16:35.160]  I
[05:16:46.040 --> 05:16:48.280]  Gotta come bot to help my twitch so they don't freeze the wave
[05:16:51.400 --> 05:16:53.560]  Like I don't want them to be able to freeze here
[05:16:55.880 --> 05:16:58.040]  Even if gregas ganks we win we win the fight right now
[05:16:58.120 --> 05:17:04.520]  Like it's an easy fight win as long as we don't get knocked up we just win the fight automatically
[05:17:12.440 --> 05:17:15.160]  Actually, I'm we're trying to bait gregas to come gank this
[05:17:23.320 --> 05:17:27.080]  Easy double flashes baby easy
[05:17:28.120 --> 05:17:32.920]  You fucking cowards
[05:17:45.000 --> 05:17:51.400]  We should back up like I can go by now. Oh gregas is top we could actually maybe do dragon
[05:17:52.360 --> 05:17:58.360]  I'm gonna be real a soul roaming is not a not in like the top list of me being like nervous about it
[05:18:00.840 --> 05:18:02.840]  Like I'm not nervous about a soul roaming man
[05:18:06.280 --> 05:18:08.680]  Push this so we can oh we're diving them
[05:18:09.960 --> 05:18:13.320]  That's a bit scary. Welcome to the league of draven
[05:18:14.360 --> 05:18:16.360]  Good to see you're back to enjoying the game
[05:18:17.080 --> 05:18:21.560]  Whoa, we're going still diving that that's not good like we back off here, man
[05:18:27.000 --> 05:18:29.240]  I mean we can maybe go up here if you really want to
[05:18:35.240 --> 05:18:37.240]  I kind of want to ward this
[05:18:43.400 --> 05:18:45.400]  I need to reset though really badly right now
[05:18:47.080 --> 05:18:49.080]  I
[05:18:50.600 --> 05:18:52.600]  Really badly
[05:18:53.480 --> 05:18:55.480]  Not being on the map here is really bad
[05:18:57.240 --> 05:19:02.200]  Or rather not like having uh gold spent and being on the map is what I meant to say like it's really fucking bad
[05:19:03.320 --> 05:19:06.760]  Yo back up. You know greg is that you watched him walk past three wards
[05:19:08.200 --> 05:19:10.520]  That's why I just warded no no he's still here
[05:19:11.480 --> 05:19:13.480]  ragas is right there
[05:19:14.440 --> 05:19:18.120]  Like we we know greg is is somewhere bot lane right now. I don't know where but we know he's there
[05:19:24.120 --> 05:19:29.400]  They're on dragon, okay, we can fight this go go go w over i'm here

[05:20:13.640 --> 05:20:15.640]  I
[05:20:19.720 --> 05:20:21.720]  Made a bitch
[05:20:27.240 --> 05:20:29.240]  Well, I guess I'll back
[05:20:30.360 --> 05:20:34.520]  Yo spartan thank you for the six months man. Welcome back appreciate it
[05:20:36.120 --> 05:20:38.680]  I guess we'll back we'll get our fucking umbral
[05:20:40.040 --> 05:20:42.040]  Uh, I'm gonna go top side of the map now
[05:20:42.920 --> 05:20:48.520]  And i'm gonna help my team get rift heralds. I'm gonna ping I want to go top side. I want to help my team get rifts
[05:20:56.280 --> 05:21:02.120]  The wave if we look at bot wave it's pushing into us. It's totally fine. Okay twitch is level six
[05:21:03.880 --> 05:21:07.640]  The bot wave is pushing in we are totally fine to do what i'm doing right now
[05:21:12.680 --> 05:21:14.680]  He doesn't know i'm here
[05:21:25.880 --> 05:21:27.880]  I'm dead though
[05:21:33.480 --> 05:21:35.000]  Ro
[05:21:37.000 --> 05:21:41.240]  No joke I almost juked that that's so close
[05:21:42.040 --> 05:21:48.440]  I was hoping like wukong for some reason didn't walk top side, uh, but the enemy bot lane did
[05:21:53.160 --> 05:21:59.480]  Okay, the enemy bot lane just griefed their entire game the game's over we win what the fuck are they doing what is happening?
[05:22:02.200 --> 05:22:04.200]  Like my twitch is just getting free plates
[05:22:05.160 --> 05:22:07.160]  I
[05:22:10.120 --> 05:22:12.120]  Wait you guys are griefing
[05:22:20.120 --> 05:22:22.120]  I'm griefing
[05:22:22.120 --> 05:22:24.120]  Dude, what the fuck
[05:22:24.200 --> 05:22:28.840]  We why would you fight them guys guys guys wukong
[05:22:29.160 --> 05:22:31.160]  Wukong
[05:22:31.640 --> 05:22:38.920]  Okay, we see that our twitch is getting free plate spot free first turret. Okay. I'm backed. I almost soloed their ad carry
[05:22:38.920 --> 05:22:42.120]  Okay, or their jungler. Why would you ever?
[05:22:42.840 --> 05:22:44.520]  on purpose
[05:22:44.520 --> 05:22:46.840]  Take a for a fight like that with no
[05:22:47.640 --> 05:22:49.640]  Oh, I have cancer
[05:22:50.280 --> 05:22:51.640]  also
[05:22:51.640 --> 05:22:56.280]  The wukong's an idiot. He doesn't understand macro at all apparently because I literally
[05:22:56.840 --> 05:23:00.120]  Pings to come to rift my wukong was like nervous
[05:23:03.240 --> 05:23:09.160]  Like for some reason wukong didn't walk top he sat bot trying to gank but the objective was rift not
[05:23:11.560 --> 05:23:14.760]  God i'm losing my mind in this elo master's players are
[05:23:15.560 --> 05:23:20.680]  Literally just diamond players with slightly better mechanics. They don't know anything about the game
[05:23:20.760 --> 05:23:23.000]  And i'm about to my brain's about to explode like a peanut
[05:23:23.160 --> 05:23:28.840]  It's not about them laning 2v2 you fucking cumquat
[05:23:30.440 --> 05:23:33.960]  Dude, I know they can't lane against us 2v2. It's not about the 2v2 man
[05:23:34.360 --> 05:23:38.920]  We we get a free rift herald because uh, we shut down their bot lane and i'm on an item spike
[05:23:39.320 --> 05:23:41.320]  So we just automatically get a free rift
[05:23:41.720 --> 05:23:43.720]  It has nothing to do with 2v2
[05:23:46.760 --> 05:23:48.760]  This cumquat motherfucker
[05:23:53.720 --> 05:23:57.080]  I don't know why that's my insult the pedestrian guy got to me
[05:23:59.400 --> 05:24:01.400]  Somehow
[05:24:07.560 --> 05:24:09.560]  Where the fuck is this war oh
[05:24:16.040 --> 05:24:20.920]  Because i'm telling you right now my macro there was 100 correct by the way like 1000 percent
[05:24:23.000 --> 05:24:25.000]  I
[05:24:31.400 --> 05:24:35.480]  Like even though i died i know it was correct. No no just do dragon do not die
[05:24:36.680 --> 05:24:39.880]  Guys we don't have to not everything's about kills not everything's about kills. We got this
[05:24:41.240 --> 05:24:43.880]  Like you don't need to die if you don't need to dive always you don't need to see a kill
[05:24:43.960 --> 05:24:50.040]  Be like ooh monkey kill brain go like the game is about like getting objectives on timers and
[05:24:50.520 --> 05:24:52.520]  Playing off of tempo and things like that
[05:24:53.080 --> 05:24:58.280]  Like the only reason we even lost rift was because my wukong went full monkey brand and was like no
[05:24:58.440 --> 05:25:02.120]  We need to not play for this rift with a giant massive lead
[05:25:20.200 --> 05:25:22.200]  Wait kill this guy
[05:25:26.200 --> 05:25:28.200]  What am I watching right now
[05:25:29.960 --> 05:25:37.000]  This is outrageous my wukong just solo ulted there dude i'm gonna lose it my wukong just solo ulted their gragas
[05:25:37.000 --> 05:25:39.000]  Solo ulted their gragas
[05:25:49.720 --> 05:25:54.840]  On a good note though they don't get any plates off of rifting so it's not that bad
[05:25:56.680 --> 05:25:59.480]  Okay, man, just push like dude hit the minions like stop
[05:26:02.040 --> 05:26:03.960]  My bad
[05:26:03.960 --> 05:26:06.200]  Sorry, i'm i'm wound up right now cannon. Okay
[05:26:07.000 --> 05:26:08.440]  I'm gonna wound
[05:26:08.440 --> 05:26:10.440]  Apologies if i uh if i grief jumen
[05:26:12.440 --> 05:26:14.440]  It's fine
[05:26:14.600 --> 05:26:16.600]  So it'll wound up it's fine
[05:26:17.080 --> 05:26:21.560]  I just don't like when like stuff like that happens. I'm a perfectionist and it's my big
[05:26:21.560 --> 05:26:26.040]  I talked about this earlier. I'm a perfectionist my biggest flaw is that like I will
[05:26:27.400 --> 05:26:31.640]  Play the game 100 correctly on like tempo and timers, but you can't do that
[05:26:32.120 --> 05:26:34.840]  Because you got to remember to like your teammates or teammates
[05:26:37.960 --> 05:26:41.960]  Like like they're not just gonna instantly know exactly what you're what what to do
[05:26:53.320 --> 05:26:59.400]  We win the guy don't just stand here and watch me die man. Holy shits
[05:27:00.120 --> 05:27:11.720]  That is oh my god, if he if he had let me die there, I might have screamed actually screamed out loud in anger
[05:27:15.160 --> 05:27:18.440]  Like dude is watching me kite these people within one inch of my life
[05:27:19.800 --> 05:27:22.680]  And instead of like helping or walking up and doing anything, you know what he does
[05:27:25.400 --> 05:27:27.400]  He pulls a fucking gross score
[05:27:30.360 --> 05:27:34.840]  My man just likes to watch something wrong with it, but you know there's a time and a place
[05:27:51.960 --> 05:27:54.600]  I don't actually want to buy pinks because I don't think we're strong enough that uh
[05:27:55.720 --> 05:27:59.080]  I don't think that we're strong enough that I can actually even defend the pinks right now if i'm being honest like
[05:28:00.120 --> 05:28:04.040]  We should be strong enough, but we kind of throw a lead when I over forced the rift
[05:28:04.760 --> 05:28:06.760]  So I think
[05:28:11.400 --> 05:28:13.400]  I think
[05:28:16.600 --> 05:28:23.560]  We need to push this wave so that we can get tempo and move around the map prior, so I keep saying the wrong thing
[05:28:24.360 --> 05:28:26.360]  I
[05:28:29.400 --> 05:28:32.200]  Oh that guy's dead. I I have to ditch that guy
[05:28:33.560 --> 05:28:35.560]  He's dead as fuck. Oh, I'm dead too. Maybe oh
[05:28:36.520 --> 05:28:38.520]  I am so dead
[05:28:38.600 --> 05:28:40.440]  Yeah, that was my bad
[05:28:40.440 --> 05:28:44.840]  That was my bad my bad my bad like I we just got we just got ran down. That was on me
[05:28:47.960 --> 05:28:53.160]  Like we we had good positioning, but um the jungler wasn't uh close enough
[05:28:53.720 --> 05:28:55.720]  This is my bad
[05:28:56.760 --> 05:29:00.360]  I also didn't expect to get fucking four man's, but I shut up right
[05:29:03.160 --> 05:29:07.480]  We should play for this though. I wish I could type. I wish I wasn't chat restricted for a year
[05:29:09.400 --> 05:29:11.880]  Dude, I swear to god. I'm not even being mean
[05:29:12.840 --> 05:29:16.600]  Like riot was like they chat restricted me because I type so much macro
[05:29:17.160 --> 05:29:19.800]  That it gets on people's nerves and they don't want me spam typing
[05:29:24.440 --> 05:29:25.560]  I
[05:29:25.560 --> 05:29:27.560]  I
[05:29:27.560 --> 05:29:29.560]  I
[05:29:29.560 --> 05:29:31.560]  I
[05:29:31.560 --> 05:29:33.560]  I
[05:29:33.560 --> 05:29:35.560]  I
[05:29:35.560 --> 05:29:37.560]  I
[05:29:37.560 --> 05:29:39.560]  I
[05:29:39.560 --> 05:29:41.560]  I
[05:29:41.560 --> 05:29:43.560]  I
[05:29:43.560 --> 05:29:45.560]  I
[05:29:45.560 --> 05:29:47.560]  I
[05:29:47.560 --> 05:29:49.560]  I
[05:29:49.560 --> 05:29:51.560]  I
[05:29:51.560 --> 05:29:53.560]  I
[05:29:55.000 --> 05:30:00.520]  Yeah, I get on chat restricted April 15th or April 11th or some shit
[05:30:01.240 --> 05:30:03.240]  Uh 2024
[05:30:04.440 --> 05:30:05.960]  I've never seen it
[05:30:05.960 --> 05:30:08.280]  It must have been like an actual riot or something
[05:30:08.840 --> 05:30:12.040]  Like I've never seen an automated system give you a year chat restricts, right?
[05:30:12.680 --> 05:30:15.000]  So in my mind, it's got to be like an actual like
[05:30:17.800 --> 05:30:19.800]  Like a rioter was like dronimo
[05:30:20.760 --> 05:30:27.160]  We know you're good enough to climb but stop typing, you know, I mean that's like what must have been going on
[05:30:33.320 --> 05:30:35.960]  And I'm like, okay, well, sure
[05:30:50.760 --> 05:30:53.800]  I mean, I didn't know you could get chat band a year
[05:30:54.680 --> 05:30:57.320]  What's weird is like I said, I don't I don't like say trigger words
[05:30:57.320 --> 05:30:59.560]  It's not like I tell people to like end themselves and stuff
[05:31:00.280 --> 05:31:02.280]  It's mainly just me typing like
[05:31:02.280 --> 05:31:05.080]  Go here do that do this like I type a lot, right?
[05:31:05.480 --> 05:31:09.080]  Which is obviously like if you type a lot it can be toxic as well. So
[05:31:13.000 --> 05:31:15.000]  Like typing a lot's annoying so I get it
[05:31:20.280 --> 05:31:22.280]  I
[05:31:26.520 --> 05:31:29.480]  We should be playing for baron side vision right now not
[05:31:30.760 --> 05:31:33.400]  The vision we're playing with right now is bad. We should be playing over here
[05:31:35.400 --> 05:31:39.240]  Like I want to play for baron vision, but it's a little hard to do that right now
[05:31:44.520 --> 05:31:47.960]  Because you see how tom kenshin me are like transferring vision control around the map right now
[05:31:48.680 --> 05:31:52.040]  We're playing this little support game of like hide the vision
[05:31:53.560 --> 05:31:56.600]  Look at this. Fuck. Look at this motherfucker
[05:32:11.320 --> 05:32:13.320]  Oh, he's so dumb
[05:32:18.200 --> 05:32:22.840]  I still think he's dumb
[05:32:31.960 --> 05:32:33.960]  How did I just take
[05:32:38.840 --> 05:32:42.280]  Tonight I took my entire HP bar in a global
[05:32:42.600 --> 05:32:48.520]  My bad dude, I really wish the mouth fight would group though
[05:32:49.880 --> 05:32:53.320]  I get that he's like doing the thing where he's like, oh, let's you know split
[05:32:53.880 --> 05:32:56.040]  Like his play was actually really smart there
[05:32:56.840 --> 05:32:58.360]  The mouth fights play I mean
[05:32:58.360 --> 05:33:00.600]  Like that wasn't his fault that we got shit on at all
[05:33:01.240 --> 05:33:05.480]  I just wish that he would group because if he groups up and hits are we win every team fight
[05:33:06.520 --> 05:33:09.160]  Because right now our only frontliner is the wukong, right?
[05:33:09.640 --> 05:33:13.080]  And the fact that wukong's our frontliner we don't have the ability to play the game
[05:33:14.920 --> 05:33:16.920]  When I get stuck on that what the fuck was that?
[05:33:18.280 --> 05:33:22.680]  Like that tom kensh getting to e forward like that blindly into our entire team
[05:33:23.320 --> 05:33:27.240]  And then not getting punished for it might be the most like solo queue thing i've ever seen
[05:33:27.960 --> 05:33:29.960]  Nobody wanted to hit him because he was the tank
[05:33:30.520 --> 05:33:32.680]  but uh
[05:33:32.680 --> 05:33:35.000]  Yeah, that's we should still kill him, you know
[05:33:39.880 --> 05:33:44.120]  We can fight this guy. Oh my god jungler just come
[05:33:45.640 --> 05:33:48.120]  Oh, we're forfeiting. Okay. Now that makes perfect sense, right?
[05:33:50.520 --> 05:33:52.120]  Just come group
[05:33:52.120 --> 05:33:54.600]  Bro, cannon come group. Please guys
[05:33:55.400 --> 05:33:58.840]  Like I don't know why everybody's frustrated. We're literally still up in gold
[05:33:59.880 --> 05:34:01.880]  Please come group up. We just took an inhibitor
[05:34:03.000 --> 05:34:05.000]  Just just come group
[05:34:05.960 --> 05:34:08.840]  Help me get vision on this dragon so that I don't so we don't die
[05:34:09.800 --> 05:34:12.760]  Like I need my team to actually walk over here to help me get vision
[05:34:15.240 --> 05:34:19.800]  It's really frustrating because I need the frontliners the wukong in the mouth fight to walk in with me
[05:34:20.600 --> 05:34:24.440]  Because I'm I'm a little fucking why I have a big gun, but I'm a big gun girl, right?
[05:34:24.840 --> 05:34:28.920]  So I need I need these two guys to walk in with me these two big burly mountain men
[05:34:29.640 --> 05:34:31.640]  So
[05:34:34.760 --> 05:34:39.800]  That I can play the game, you know, no, we don't push bot no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[05:34:41.160 --> 05:34:43.160]  No, bot is worthless. Come in
[05:34:43.560 --> 05:34:45.560]  My mouth fight's pushing the wave that we already have down
[05:34:46.440 --> 05:34:48.440]  I wish I could macro
[05:34:48.520 --> 05:34:52.200]  I wish I could type some macro right now there. They're like my team is so lost
[05:34:55.000 --> 05:34:57.000]  They're so beyond lost right now, it's crazy
[05:34:59.160 --> 05:35:01.160]  They're lost this shit
[05:35:08.840 --> 05:35:12.040]  Just do two dragon. Yes, just do this just do I'll start it for you. Here you go
[05:35:13.080 --> 05:35:16.840]  I don't know why we're standing in a bush waiting for them to face check do dragon guys
[05:35:21.800 --> 05:35:26.200]  I'm I swear to god you have to do everything in the zero where you have to start every fight
[05:35:26.680 --> 05:35:28.680]  I have to basically I have to start every fight
[05:35:29.400 --> 05:35:33.800]  Right, I have to not only start every fight, but I have to like ping my team what to do exactly
[05:35:34.440 --> 05:35:36.840]  Because everybody plays so safe in this elo
[05:35:37.640 --> 05:35:39.800]  Why did my mouth fight just stop his back?
[05:35:41.720 --> 05:35:43.720]  Why are you all fighting?
[05:35:47.480 --> 05:35:49.480]  Oh my god, please guys
[05:35:52.920 --> 05:35:54.920]  It's fine it's fine fine
[05:35:55.320 --> 05:35:57.320]  No mouth fight you can't 1v9 that
[05:35:57.560 --> 05:35:58.680]  Just back off
[05:35:58.680 --> 05:36:02.600]  They didn't get anything they didn't get anything. We got dragon. We're on dragon soul points
[05:36:04.760 --> 05:36:06.440]  I'm losing hairs
[05:36:06.440 --> 05:36:11.240]  I'm losing fucking hairs man. I ain't got many hairs to spare anymore. We're out here losing hair
[05:36:17.320 --> 05:36:20.600]  It's like I'm babysitting like this has got to be what a preschool teacher feels like you know
[05:36:21.480 --> 05:36:25.960]  Like low-key like preschool teacher just feels feels like this this has to be it
[05:36:31.400 --> 05:36:37.000]  Like watching it's like watching a toddler like you watch them from the corner, right and they're like eating glue and you're like
[05:36:38.040 --> 05:36:41.160]  I mean that's bad and then you tell them like don't eat glue don't eat glue timmy
[05:36:41.400 --> 05:36:42.600]  And he's like okay
[05:36:42.600 --> 05:36:46.280]  And then like you leave him there for five minutes to go like do something to watch somebody else
[05:36:46.520 --> 05:36:48.840]  Then all of a sudden timmy's eating glue again, and you're like bro
[05:36:49.080 --> 05:36:53.160]  Bro bro, we just had this discussion
[05:37:00.840 --> 05:37:03.320]  And it's like not timmy's fault right because he's a toddler
[05:37:04.680 --> 05:37:10.520]  So you can't be mad at timmy because he's a toddler you can't but it's like it's frustrating. It's like god damn it man

[05:37:56.680 --> 05:37:58.680]  It's kind of nuts
[05:38:01.160 --> 05:38:03.480]  Okay, it still feels not enough

[05:42:12.040 --> 05:42:19.480]  Like I feel like every like I feel like what Walter white felt like dealing with skylark for literally three years like this is outrageous
[05:42:20.520 --> 05:42:25.080]  This is what this feels like like I I can relate to the show so much more
[05:42:27.160 --> 05:42:29.160]  Oh my god
[05:42:30.120 --> 05:42:32.120]  Like dude
[05:42:32.120 --> 05:42:34.120]  Oh
[05:42:34.120 --> 05:42:36.120]  Oh
[05:42:56.360 --> 05:42:58.360]  Crap
[05:42:58.760 --> 05:43:02.760]  Dude look at just look at the like look at like what's going on in the game
[05:43:04.600 --> 05:43:06.600]  Like
[05:43:09.400 --> 05:43:13.560]  Like I I don't even mean to be mean about this. It's just this is this is crazy
[05:43:17.000 --> 05:43:20.760]  Mouth fight though popping off mouth fight popping off
[05:43:29.800 --> 05:43:31.800]  Like what are you doing this guy
[05:43:32.440 --> 05:43:34.440]  Oh, he's literally diamond
[05:43:39.720 --> 05:43:45.400]  Why is this guy in this game? I mean I feel I feel like confused now. I'm not even blaming the wukong anymore
[05:43:45.400 --> 05:43:47.400]  I don't know why this guy is in the game
[05:43:48.120 --> 05:43:50.600]  Oh, he hasn't flayed to the SMMR
[05:43:54.760 --> 05:43:57.480]  Oh, he just has previous season inflated the MMR
[05:43:58.040 --> 05:44:00.920]  That's what the sense because he was GM for three years
[05:44:02.200 --> 05:44:07.960]  So the his MMR says that he like belongs here even though he doesn't play like I bet you last season he only played like 50 games
[05:44:10.600 --> 05:44:15.640]  I can look right we just see like how many games he played. Yeah, he played. He played like 50 games last season
[05:44:16.600 --> 05:44:19.480]  So like his MMR didn't really change. He just got masters and then stopped
[05:44:21.000 --> 05:44:23.000]  Which is fine. There's nothing wrong with that
[05:44:23.240 --> 05:44:25.240]  I
[05:44:30.760 --> 05:44:32.760]  Just wish he would chill, you know
[05:44:33.880 --> 05:44:36.840]  Like like uh not rage quit halfway through the game
[05:44:39.480 --> 05:44:42.520]  Because like I said people's elo and shit used to bother me a lot
[05:44:42.600 --> 05:44:44.920]  I don't I don't get bothered by anymore because I realized it was cringe
[05:44:45.400 --> 05:44:49.000]  I don't care about their elo and shit. What I care about is like I just want them to play the game
[05:44:49.000 --> 05:44:54.120]  You know what I mean like I just want them to not rage not not like be absolute apes in the game and just play
[05:44:54.200 --> 05:44:55.800]  That's all I ask for
[05:44:55.800 --> 05:44:58.920]  I don't care if you're a diamond player or a player in the game and you're just like accidentally in the game
[05:44:59.000 --> 05:45:01.160]  It's not your fault. I just want you to push buttons
[05:45:05.560 --> 05:45:07.560]  What I'm doing wrong to have a 36 one rate
[05:45:11.240 --> 05:45:14.600]  Uh, I can't see the link because just you'd have to give me your name and your server
[05:45:14.600 --> 05:45:21.880]  How you guys doing by the way everybody having a good day you guys enjoying the stream having a good time
[05:45:22.840 --> 05:45:29.320]  Watching me go bald in live like live time. You guys are like, oh look, dronimo's going bald live on stream and I'm like, yeah
[05:45:31.160 --> 05:45:33.740]  It's rough. Hold on. I'm gonna take my pants off
[05:45:44.600 --> 05:45:46.600]  You
[05:45:46.600 --> 05:45:48.600]  You
[05:46:13.720 --> 05:46:15.720]  Dude what I
[05:46:15.720 --> 05:46:17.720]  Fuck you guys
[05:46:17.720 --> 05:46:22.920]  They fucking like I get double swapped. Did you guys see that shit? They're like, oh, yeah the support could do it and then he banned
[05:46:23.000 --> 05:46:24.760]  Sanna
[05:46:24.760 --> 05:46:26.760]  I mean, I didn't hover it. So that's my bad
[05:46:27.640 --> 05:46:30.920]  God damn it. I should have hovered. I was just like taking my pants off
[05:46:33.960 --> 05:46:35.960]  And now he wants first pick
[05:46:37.960 --> 05:46:39.960]  Dude what
[05:46:40.840 --> 05:46:44.040]  Oh my god, I hate I don't I don't know. I don't know what to say. This is crazy
[05:46:46.600 --> 05:46:48.600]  I
[05:46:49.000 --> 05:46:51.000]  Today's Thursday, right? I
[05:46:51.880 --> 05:46:54.280]  Am I losing days today's Thursday, right guys?
[05:47:03.160 --> 05:47:05.160]  It is okay cool
[05:47:05.960 --> 05:47:08.600]  Uh, what do I play they have zereth and zen
[05:47:10.280 --> 05:47:13.400]  If zaya, I mean, I guess I could just play recon. It's not big deal
[05:47:16.120 --> 05:47:18.120]  I
[05:47:21.080 --> 05:47:25.080]  See what their balling is though. I actually have to see what their balling is to choose my runes
[05:47:28.840 --> 05:47:35.480]  Sona no, oh they have an israel the fuck is their team comp? Um
[05:47:38.360 --> 05:47:40.360]  Okay
[05:47:45.720 --> 05:47:47.720]  You
[05:47:59.800 --> 05:48:03.400]  When you do this build, what's the secondary supposed to be I think it's supposed to be this
[05:48:07.720 --> 05:48:11.960]  Or maybe like revitalize I just feel like I'm flinching so good
[05:48:12.440 --> 05:48:14.440]  Oh
[05:48:15.080 --> 05:48:17.080]  They have a support
[05:48:17.320 --> 05:48:19.800]  Zarath so supports that yeah, yeah, okay, so I want uh
[05:48:21.080 --> 05:48:23.320]  I definitely want glacial here and I want
[05:48:25.480 --> 05:48:29.400]  Maybe I take mr actually instead of armor because they have two poke champs
[05:48:30.920 --> 05:48:33.720]  And I take this. Yeah. Yeah, this is good. Okay
[05:48:36.840 --> 05:48:40.280]  That's not bad. Okay one second. I'll be right back. I need to get some more water
[05:48:41.960 --> 05:48:43.960]  So
[05:49:11.960 --> 05:49:13.960]  So
[05:49:26.040 --> 05:49:28.200]  Welcome to son
[05:49:35.960 --> 05:49:37.960]  30 seconds until minion spawn
[05:49:42.920 --> 05:49:44.920]  Brown
[05:49:47.800 --> 05:49:49.800]  Oh, shit. No, don't flag me
[05:49:51.240 --> 05:49:53.240]  Fuck man, I had to pee
[05:49:53.640 --> 05:49:55.720]  Don't fucking flag me for afk because I didn't take a week
[05:49:58.200 --> 05:50:02.200]  Can you not start with ad carry to move over to support I always fall asleep before the ad carried gameplay
[05:50:03.400 --> 05:50:07.240]  Wait, what I fell asleep before ad carry. What do you mean?
[05:50:07.880 --> 05:50:11.320]  I love to hurt. Oh, you mean like start with my main and then play
[05:50:14.200 --> 05:50:16.200]  Yeah, I played ad carry at the start
[05:50:26.280 --> 05:50:31.800]  I should probably play ad carry more over support
[05:50:34.040 --> 05:50:35.640]  Later in the stream
[05:50:35.640 --> 05:50:38.760]  Here I'll play an ad carry game after this. I feel bad
[05:50:57.000 --> 05:50:59.800]  Oh, it's gragas. I thought it was gonna be zara, but it's gragas
[05:51:00.360 --> 05:51:02.360]  I
[05:51:04.040 --> 05:51:08.440]  Don't want to fight too hard level one even though that guy I should have gone in there. That was my bad
[05:51:09.240 --> 05:51:12.760]  I want to I want to try and get level two here even though. I think we actually win level one
[05:51:15.880 --> 05:51:19.480]  Oh, I got his bone plating. Yeah, I should have fought level one. That was my bad
[05:51:20.760 --> 05:51:23.080]  Because we went very hard level one. I just griefed it
[05:51:24.520 --> 05:51:28.680]  Like all I have to do there is go in on the Ezreal or the gragas level one and they can't play the game
[05:51:30.360 --> 05:51:32.360]  Right
[05:51:47.640 --> 05:51:53.240]  It's not worth it's not worth there's no way that I can not get eed by gragas there by the way
[05:51:55.640 --> 05:51:58.040]  Like I don't know if I can flash w there
[05:51:59.800 --> 05:52:02.200]  No, I yeah, have you seen this cape?
[05:52:09.320 --> 05:52:11.320]  Maybe we shouldn't be egoing buddy
[05:52:16.040 --> 05:52:19.400]  Guy's just fucking egos in front of me like what?
[05:52:30.760 --> 05:52:38.920]  Okay, I might have missed everything there, but like you know, it's okay
[05:52:51.880 --> 05:52:57.960]  It's a little counter productive when I take a tower shot to land a queue
[05:52:59.800 --> 05:53:01.800]  Feels a little counter productive
[05:53:09.080 --> 05:53:11.080]  But hey
[05:53:14.200 --> 05:53:19.160]  I'm gonna back here just in case the enemy zin tries to gank him in
[05:53:22.040 --> 05:53:24.040]  Dude, I'm so sad. I can't get boots
[05:53:24.680 --> 05:53:26.680]  I
[05:53:29.400 --> 05:53:35.080]  I'm gonna wait. Yeah, I'm gonna be cringe. I'm gonna wait. I would never wait here normally, but you know what?
[05:53:35.080 --> 05:53:37.080]  It's just it's so like it's such a big buy
[05:53:38.920 --> 05:53:40.920]  I don't want to I'm I'm off
[05:53:41.720 --> 05:53:47.480]  Now that now that I've waited and beat cringe now I have to sit here and wait. Oh, it's so painful. Okay. I'm on my way
[05:53:48.760 --> 05:53:50.760]  I'm sorry guys
[05:53:54.680 --> 05:53:56.680]  I
[05:54:07.640 --> 05:54:09.640]  Weren't the wait no not at all
[05:54:13.080 --> 05:54:15.080]  I got lucky, but
[05:54:24.120 --> 05:54:26.120]  I
[05:54:26.360 --> 05:54:29.800]  You know what's interesting I never use the stupid dematerializer
[05:54:30.440 --> 05:54:34.600]  I feel like I should have like I should use it on every cannon or some shit, but I just don't do it
[05:54:35.400 --> 05:54:38.200]  Because I know the reason you're supposed to use it is because it helps you push
[05:54:39.080 --> 05:54:41.640]  Because you can dematerialize the cannon right and just instead. Yeah
[05:54:42.600 --> 05:54:45.480]  So you're supposed to use it because it's like a really fast way to push but it's also uh
[05:54:54.280 --> 05:54:56.280]  I
[05:55:03.160 --> 05:55:10.120]  Should not have wed fuck. I won't not the Gragas anyway. I fucked up. I shouldn't have wed the Gragas. I should play it slower
[05:55:13.000 --> 05:55:15.000]  This guy's gonna die
[05:55:16.520 --> 05:55:19.400]  Oh, he's gonna die you put himself against the wall gg
[05:55:19.560 --> 05:55:21.560]  I
[05:55:21.800 --> 05:55:23.960]  That was my fault though 100%
[05:55:28.120 --> 05:55:33.000]  Because if I didn't w in they can't kill us right and Gragas probably dies to the auto attack anyway
[05:55:33.480 --> 05:55:36.520]  My thought process was Gragas is snared. So if I w here
[05:55:37.080 --> 05:55:41.000]  But even after like even if I don't get e'd I'm pretty confident I die
[05:55:49.400 --> 05:55:51.400]  I
[05:55:51.400 --> 05:55:53.400]  I
[05:55:53.400 --> 05:55:55.400]  I
[05:55:55.400 --> 05:55:57.400]  I
[05:56:17.640 --> 05:56:19.640]  Damn it. I tried I was out of everything
[05:56:22.680 --> 05:56:24.680]  Damn
[05:56:25.640 --> 05:56:31.480]  I wonder if I could have played that better maybe like if I could have weaved an extra auto in or something
[05:56:32.680 --> 05:56:34.680]  I don't know
[05:56:34.920 --> 05:56:36.920]  It's hard to know
[05:56:36.920 --> 05:56:38.920]  I
[05:56:52.440 --> 05:56:56.280]  I'm gonna go mid here I can't okay
[05:56:59.000 --> 05:57:02.360]  What could go mid but I think I I think I want to sit bot for a bit and get some xp
[05:57:02.440 --> 05:57:06.920]  I think it's smarter to do that at this points
[05:57:09.880 --> 05:57:11.880]  I think we should push this
[05:57:12.200 --> 05:57:14.200]  It's gonna be
[05:57:28.120 --> 05:57:33.960]  I don't want to w in because I know Zin's area. That's why I didn't want to w because I know Zin's here
[05:57:42.120 --> 05:57:44.120]  They
[05:57:48.280 --> 05:57:51.240]  They were just making it so obvious right like that it was like
[05:57:52.840 --> 05:57:57.000]  Sometimes when people make shit too good to be true it is too good to be true
[05:57:58.280 --> 05:58:01.320]  Yeah, like oh shit. We're just gonna they're just gonna fight us here cool
[05:58:03.400 --> 05:58:05.400]  Oh, yeah, I gotta help him push my bad
[05:58:08.760 --> 05:58:10.760]  I'm playing sloppy
[05:58:11.880 --> 05:58:13.880]  I think we got a problem
[05:58:35.640 --> 05:58:37.640]  You guys want to see a cool trick watch this
[05:58:37.800 --> 05:58:46.360]  She could push the wave and then just min max the back. Yeah, how cool was that?
[05:58:50.600 --> 05:58:54.360]  She just pushes the wave and I just back next to the bush and she's just like oh, I guess I'll take the free ride
[05:59:08.040 --> 05:59:10.600]  I really need level six badly
[05:59:22.600 --> 05:59:27.800]  Like bro, I really cannot get level six right now. This is painful
[05:59:28.520 --> 05:59:30.520]  Okay
[05:59:33.480 --> 05:59:35.960]  Hey kill these maybe I'm six off this nope. Guess not
[05:59:37.240 --> 05:59:40.360]  I was gonna stay mid there by the way and help the homie
[05:59:41.800 --> 05:59:43.800]  I need to go mid
[05:59:58.520 --> 06:00:00.520]  I
[06:00:12.680 --> 06:00:14.680]  This is so awkward
[06:00:28.040 --> 06:00:30.040]  Bro help me
[06:00:35.960 --> 06:00:43.480]  Bro like you gotta walk to me like I can't like my eve is like here. I'm way over here
[06:00:44.680 --> 06:00:47.080]  Right in my eve's like yo homie
[06:00:49.880 --> 06:00:56.120]  Like dude, I'm like we're trying to push the wave in for her and she's just not accepting to wait
[06:00:58.280 --> 06:01:00.760]  And I can't w the wall
[06:01:00.840 --> 06:01:04.200]  I mean I guess I could w the wall because I was trying to walk around right?
[06:01:04.200 --> 06:01:08.680]  I saw her in trouble when I was here. So I wanted her to walk towards here so I could e over the wall
[06:01:09.720 --> 06:01:12.360]  That was my thought process e over the wall helped the guy
[06:01:12.840 --> 06:01:16.920]  But he like didn't understand that and I just got shit on and it felt really bad
[06:01:21.960 --> 06:01:24.120]  Both our solos are getting absolutely shit on
[06:01:24.200 --> 06:01:26.200]  I
[06:01:26.440 --> 06:01:31.800]  This is very bad because I don't know how to help our team at this stage
[06:01:35.160 --> 06:01:39.320]  Like I'm just always behind on tempo now around the map in the wrong spot at the wrong time
[06:01:54.440 --> 06:02:07.560]  This is so awkward I have all we could kill this guy
[06:02:12.280 --> 06:02:14.280]  Guess not
[06:02:16.200 --> 06:02:18.200]  You could maybe kill the zen if I sneak in here
[06:02:24.280 --> 06:02:26.280]  I
[06:02:35.800 --> 06:02:39.480]  Push the wave push the wave hurry he's got to crash it
[06:02:55.080 --> 06:02:57.080]  I mean this guy's just dead
[06:03:01.000 --> 06:03:06.440]  My ad carry is gonna get fucked for it though. So I hope it was worth like my ad carry is gonna get zoned
[06:03:13.640 --> 06:03:16.920]  It's really hard to tell if anything like that's worth sometimes because
[06:03:18.840 --> 06:03:23.480]  I used my ult before a dragon fight. We're gonna lose bot tower. There's just so many factors right? It's so hard
[06:03:24.200 --> 06:03:26.700]  And now I don't have words. Oh, it's so rough
[06:03:45.800 --> 06:03:48.520]  I got the ignite off but dude, I can't believe that gragas lived
[06:03:49.400 --> 06:03:51.400]  No, oh, I had stopwatch
[06:03:52.120 --> 06:03:56.360]  I have stopwatch. Oh my god. I'm the worst player in existence
[06:03:57.240 --> 06:04:01.320]  I actually have the ability to live there. Oh, no
[06:04:04.360 --> 06:04:07.560]  I should sell my magi's and shame
[06:04:09.080 --> 06:04:11.000]  I actually just want the item so
[06:04:12.920 --> 06:04:14.920]  Dude, I'm so bad
[06:04:15.640 --> 06:04:19.720]  Dude, Gragas is low key a good pick versus rakan though. You can stop his engage so easily
[06:04:21.400 --> 06:04:23.400]  He has a strong internal
[06:04:27.160 --> 06:04:30.040]  I don't want a world that's... It's actually low key a good pick
[06:04:47.320 --> 06:04:49.320]  Magic is supposed to be scared
[06:04:49.320 --> 06:04:51.320]  It's supposed to hurt
[06:04:56.520 --> 06:04:58.520]  Bro
[06:05:19.800 --> 06:05:21.800]  Nice not bad
[06:05:31.800 --> 06:05:33.800]  I kind of want to back off here
[06:05:36.040 --> 06:05:43.560]  You know what feels kind of bad you guys notice that I just I got my uh, I don't know if you guys noticed this but I got my fucking
[06:05:44.120 --> 06:05:51.480]  I got like four assists just now, but it was after I sold my magi's. How fucking bad does that feel?
[06:05:52.680 --> 06:05:54.680]  Like actually
[06:05:58.520 --> 06:06:00.520]  Oh
[06:06:00.520 --> 06:06:02.520]  By the way, uh, I wanted to ask you guys
[06:06:03.720 --> 06:06:06.120]  What ad carry do you guys think is the most
[06:06:06.920 --> 06:06:08.920]  sought out for people to learn like
[06:06:09.240 --> 06:06:11.240]  What ad carry do you guys think is the most
[06:06:12.040 --> 06:06:14.040]  sought out for people to learn right now
[06:06:16.760 --> 06:06:21.560]  Like what would you say is like people want to learn this ad carry over other ad carries
[06:06:22.360 --> 06:06:24.360]  What do you guys think?
[06:06:24.600 --> 06:06:26.600]  My man says timmo. Okay
[06:06:26.760 --> 06:06:28.760]  Make sense
[06:06:28.760 --> 06:06:30.760]  Got it
[06:06:31.400 --> 06:06:33.400]  I
[06:06:37.640 --> 06:06:40.440]  Depends yeah, I'm just trying to wonder like what um
[06:06:42.280 --> 06:06:45.240]  People would want to watch or what people would want to learn
[06:06:45.960 --> 06:06:49.800]  Specifically because I know everybody plays different shit, but I know there's also like popular shit, you know
[06:06:55.320 --> 06:06:57.320]  Okay, I'm just bad
[06:06:57.720 --> 06:07:00.280]  He's bad too. We listen we're we're bad
[06:07:00.760 --> 06:07:03.400]  We're bad guys
[06:07:30.760 --> 06:07:32.760]  You
[06:07:49.000 --> 06:07:51.000]  Oh not bad
[06:07:52.280 --> 06:07:54.280]  Jin lucian's Iofelios
[06:07:54.440 --> 06:07:58.040]  Damn, is it like just that different like a lot of people like different stuff
[06:07:58.920 --> 06:08:02.440]  Because I've always just thought like oh no
[06:08:10.520 --> 06:08:12.840]  I guess I've always just thought that people like um
[06:08:15.880 --> 06:08:19.720]  A lot of people really like like meta ad carries or like really play makey ad carries, right?
[06:08:20.120 --> 06:08:22.600]  Like jinx is probably the best ad carry in the meta
[06:08:23.000 --> 06:08:26.760]  But I don't see a lot of people ever ask or like requests to watch jinx
[06:08:27.480 --> 06:08:31.640]  You know what I mean like jinx is not like she's not like a fun ad carry that people want to learn how to play
[06:08:32.040 --> 06:08:34.040]  Even though she is like the best ad
[06:08:34.280 --> 06:08:36.520]  There's like the people who are like, oh, yeah, no jinx is boring
[06:08:36.520 --> 06:08:39.640]  Like I want to play jinn and like shoot people or I want to play like lucian and dash around
[06:08:39.880 --> 06:08:44.600]  Like it's like so that's what I'm wondering is like what the number one ad carry is for like people just like enjoy watching
[06:08:57.720 --> 06:09:01.400]  Not bad though, okay, I think we could play an ad carry game. I'm down
[06:09:04.520 --> 06:09:05.720]  I
[06:09:05.720 --> 06:09:07.720]  Oh, you guys an ad carry game
[06:09:07.720 --> 06:09:12.360]  I owe you that much for watching me play support for two hours. Actually, I think it was like two and a half hours
[06:09:14.840 --> 06:09:17.480]  Uh, yeah, we played four games of support so it's like two hours
[06:09:18.760 --> 06:09:21.000]  Yeah, I owe you guys for for that
[06:09:21.000 --> 06:09:23.000]  Yeah, I owe you guys for for that
[06:09:29.160 --> 06:09:34.840]  Ziya or vain ziya is fun to watch I do like ziya you love jinx and kate. Oh, there you go
[06:09:41.640 --> 06:09:44.040]  You're playing support top so you like to watch how ad carries play it
[06:09:46.600 --> 06:09:49.400]  So that you can like better help the homies got it got it
[06:09:51.880 --> 06:09:53.880]  You
[06:10:02.200 --> 06:10:07.320]  We need eight wins I think from this point we are right now. I think it's eight wins to get to grandmaster
[06:10:08.440 --> 06:10:10.440]  I think oops
[06:10:13.480 --> 06:10:17.320]  Because we're what 370 something right like three set 360
[06:10:18.280 --> 06:10:21.720]  No, we just won we're not 360 we're like 370
[06:10:23.080 --> 06:10:28.200]  We're 387. Okay, so we're it's not updated, but what is this stop?
[06:10:31.720 --> 06:10:35.880]  So we need what seven wins net wins to get to GM
[06:10:36.680 --> 06:10:42.360]  I think we can hit GM. I'm a little less confident right now about master or about challenger
[06:10:42.360 --> 06:10:44.360]  But I think we can definitely hit GM
[06:10:45.160 --> 06:10:47.160]  Like I think I'll get stuck in gym for a bit
[06:10:47.880 --> 06:10:49.880]  unless
[06:10:52.520 --> 06:10:54.520]  Unless
[06:10:55.000 --> 06:10:58.840]  The games get higher quality. I'll be stuck in gym for a little bit
[06:11:03.720 --> 06:11:06.840]  Because the thing about the thing about the games so far is like
[06:11:07.480 --> 06:11:12.840]  The higher quality the games get the easier it actually is to carry if like if you're a decent player
[06:11:13.480 --> 06:11:20.040]  Because the better your teammates get which means that like if you're at that like say like a challenger player
[06:11:20.040 --> 06:11:24.120]  We'll have a better time a challenger ad carry player carrying in challenger if they get a lead
[06:11:24.520 --> 06:11:27.640]  Then in diamond if they get a lead if if that like
[06:11:28.440 --> 06:11:33.240]  I know that sounds weird to say but that's it's it's basically just because like when your teammates are better
[06:11:33.240 --> 06:11:38.840]  They enable you better and ad carry and all those other roles when they're being enabled. It's a lot easier to play the game
[06:11:43.000 --> 06:11:48.440]  Like if I were to first pick jinx in challenger mmr
[06:11:49.000 --> 06:11:52.600]  There's a good chance my teammates would pick stuff that like lets me play jinx
[06:11:53.160 --> 06:11:57.080]  Right not saying it would happen, but there's like a chance that my teammates would pick something that like
[06:11:57.880 --> 06:12:00.360]  They would pick like tanks or front liners or some shit, right?
[06:12:00.760 --> 06:12:04.440]  Or like lulu whereas like if you pick in if you're picking jinx first picking like
[06:12:05.000 --> 06:12:07.000]  Let's say you guys are gold average
[06:12:07.160 --> 06:12:11.160]  Like your support might just literally pick like first time velkans or some shit and you're like well this sucks
[06:12:13.560 --> 06:12:15.560]  I
[06:12:23.720 --> 06:12:28.680]  Dude I swear every time I hear the end of this song does anybody know who forest within is
[06:12:30.360 --> 06:12:35.480]  I swear the guy talking at the end of this song sounds exactly like forest within
[06:12:37.240 --> 06:12:39.240]  No joke listen to this listen to this
[06:12:43.240 --> 06:12:45.240]  That
[06:12:47.560 --> 06:12:52.360]  That guy who was like saying it was dj what like that guy sounded exactly like I don't know why my brain does that
[06:12:52.600 --> 06:12:56.040]  Homie sounded exactly like forest within I swear to god
[06:12:56.600 --> 06:13:01.320]  It's actually like perfectly like if you told me that was him. I would immediately believe you
[06:13:06.600 --> 06:13:08.600]  This guy wants to join the discord
[06:13:09.320 --> 06:13:12.200]  Oh, I'm I'm nervous about this shit
[06:13:14.360 --> 06:13:18.760]  It is my support though so like maybe we could join the discord
[06:13:21.800 --> 06:13:24.200]  And like work together a bit
[06:13:30.280 --> 06:13:34.840]  But I'm also nervous about joining discord calls with people on stream
[06:13:38.760 --> 06:13:40.760]  I
[06:13:41.400 --> 06:13:43.560]  Don't know I don't know if it's worth
[06:13:44.440 --> 06:13:47.400]  Where would you put ezreal on the tier list? I think ezreal's a tier
[06:13:48.120 --> 06:13:53.560]  I think he could be s tier for solo queue, but he's hard. He's really hard as well as one of the hardest 80s
[06:13:53.960 --> 06:13:58.120]  So I would say he's like a tier right now if you're really good at this
[06:13:59.160 --> 06:14:04.280]  He is very very very strong, but he's also incredibly hard to play
[06:14:05.000 --> 06:14:10.760]  But he also is not weak in the meta so I'd give him like strong a
[06:14:12.840 --> 06:14:14.840]  Like above other a's
[06:14:16.520 --> 06:14:20.040]  She focused on mage supports like brand xerath or engage like blitz nautilus
[06:14:20.680 --> 06:14:22.840]  It depends on your elo and it depends on what you're doing
[06:14:23.880 --> 06:14:26.280]  I think engage supports and lower elo are
[06:14:29.320 --> 06:14:31.320]  Bad
[06:14:32.280 --> 06:14:39.320]  I don't somebody dodged I think engage supports and lower elo are bad personally because I think that uh
[06:14:41.960 --> 06:14:47.640]  You can be a really good engage player and it doesn't matter if your team just gets caught over and over again
[06:14:47.640 --> 06:14:50.600]  Or if you like make it engage and your team misplays, right?
[06:14:51.080 --> 06:14:54.600]  So it's like if you want to play engage supports do it
[06:14:55.080 --> 06:14:59.160]  Because they are better than other like engage supports are better than mages
[06:14:59.480 --> 06:15:02.760]  But I think in solo queue mages are better to solo carry
[06:15:03.480 --> 06:15:07.080]  So it just depends it depends on your elo and it depends on like what you're trying to accomplish, right?
[06:15:07.880 --> 06:15:10.840]  Because a lot of the time as a support player, it's why I play senna
[06:15:11.320 --> 06:15:16.040]  Right like I play senna because I like being able to carry games as support
[06:15:16.680 --> 06:15:18.680]  That's why I like senna
[06:15:19.160 --> 06:15:21.160]  Whereas like if you're a um
[06:15:22.280 --> 06:15:25.640]  Like if I like I can play almost every support right I can play nautilus
[06:15:25.720 --> 06:15:27.720]  I can play play I can play these supports
[06:15:27.720 --> 06:15:33.080]  But the problem is is like I feel bad if like I get like it feels really shitty to get people ahead and then have them
[06:15:33.160 --> 06:15:37.480]  Completely throw their leads over and over again and then tilt and range and shit. So it feels like dog shits
[06:15:38.120 --> 06:15:44.520]  So it's nicer to just like give myself the opportunity to carry rather than rely 100 on other people, you know
[06:15:47.080 --> 06:15:49.080]  But I would say the number one thing is
[06:15:50.440 --> 06:15:52.440]  Play what you think is fun
[06:15:52.440 --> 06:15:56.440]  That's just the number one rule like playing if you want to win you can play meta
[06:15:57.000 --> 06:16:01.880]  But the problem is is if like you're shoving your face and I'm trying to learn a meta champ that you just don't enjoy the play style of
[06:16:02.200 --> 06:16:07.000]  You're never going to actually be good at the at the champion because you're you're like it's like you're working, right?
[06:16:07.560 --> 06:16:11.320]  But the best way to learn the champions and learn how to play the game is to have fun
[06:16:11.720 --> 06:16:13.640]  Because you're not having fun at some point
[06:16:13.640 --> 06:16:18.760]  You're not going to be able to learn how to play because you're not going to be able to put in the hours or put in the games
[06:16:18.760 --> 06:16:20.280]  And like be focused during the game
[06:16:20.280 --> 06:16:22.920]  You're going to be frustrated and if you're frustrated you're not going to be learning
[06:16:23.400 --> 06:16:25.400]  So I would say just play something that's fun
[06:16:28.600 --> 06:16:30.760]  The fun aspect is going to be way more important
[06:16:36.200 --> 06:16:38.200]  Where'd my music go fuck
[06:16:38.200 --> 06:16:40.200]  I
[06:16:48.920 --> 06:16:54.120]  I'm surprised can you guys even hear the music half the time I have it on so low that I'm not even sure you guys can hear it
[06:16:55.320 --> 06:16:57.320]  It's just like bear me background noise
[06:17:09.160 --> 06:17:11.160]  You
[06:17:19.400 --> 06:17:27.000]  Is this guy holding swap hostage join call and I'll swap
[06:17:33.560 --> 06:17:36.060]  Dude he's holding swap hostage
[06:17:39.160 --> 06:17:41.160]  You
[06:17:46.760 --> 06:17:51.560]  By the way, if you guys do like the stream don't forget to follow you can scroll down to see all my socials too
[06:17:52.360 --> 06:17:54.920]  Like tech talk instagram all that crap
[06:17:55.800 --> 06:17:58.040]  It's all below the stream. There's like links and shit
[06:17:58.040 --> 06:18:12.200]  And uh, you know a man's gotta eat you can use your twitch prime too if you want, you know you're feeling it
[06:18:24.440 --> 06:18:26.440]  I'm gonna do a kaisa game
[06:18:26.680 --> 06:18:32.520]  He went lux but I kind of want to play kaisa
[06:18:36.200 --> 06:18:38.920]  What was the voice this is what happens when I get close to the mic
[06:18:42.360 --> 06:18:48.200]  I I should put the mic in front of my face more the mic's like over to the corner so the mic is like really badly directions
[06:18:56.440 --> 06:18:58.440]  You
[06:19:12.760 --> 06:19:14.760]  Says a cut down game there's
[06:19:17.240 --> 06:19:23.160]  Gregor's always use ap he doesn't go tank he goes like ap I kind of want to go last stands
[06:19:26.440 --> 06:19:28.440]  I
[06:19:39.880 --> 06:19:43.640]  That's fun. I should have taken ghost ghost little rents so good this game
[06:19:45.880 --> 06:19:47.880]  Fuck
[06:19:48.680 --> 06:19:52.040]  You tried kate with shield bow it's strong. Yeah, it's fun, huh?
[06:19:53.960 --> 06:19:55.960]  I love kate with shield bow. It's so fun
[06:19:56.600 --> 06:19:58.600]  This would have been such a good ghost game
[06:19:59.720 --> 06:20:01.720]  I'm frustrated. Oh well
[06:20:03.000 --> 06:20:05.000]  I like wasn't paying attention
[06:20:09.960 --> 06:20:11.960]  All right
[06:20:15.320 --> 06:20:19.560]  I I always wonder if I should go part of me always wants to go like
[06:20:20.440 --> 06:20:25.560]  Uh long sword three against thresh and xiah, but with kaisa
[06:20:26.200 --> 06:20:29.960]  I feel like you're on really specific timers with kaisa. So you have to go like
[06:20:30.920 --> 06:20:32.920]  It's really important to go
[06:20:33.080 --> 06:20:38.200]  Doran so they even get the q upgrade timer on the right, you know, like on the right timing
[06:20:39.720 --> 06:20:41.880]  I've been getting the q upgrade timers just so big
[06:20:43.320 --> 06:20:46.600]  Also this game I feel like I go bork this game
[06:20:47.320 --> 06:20:55.160]  Seconds borker what's ends if gregas is not ultra fed. I'll probably go bork because I don't want to get what's in just for gregas
[06:21:05.160 --> 06:21:07.160]  Okay, you started q
[06:21:07.560 --> 06:21:09.560]  Oh
[06:21:15.080 --> 06:21:18.280]  Oh diana's starting on wolves, okay
[06:21:21.560 --> 06:21:26.200]  It's a good day for a hunt. I didn't get some coffee after this game. We're getting drowsy
[06:21:37.160 --> 06:21:39.160]  I
[06:21:45.960 --> 06:21:51.720]  Should have done the middle minion thing. I'm so bad like I should have legitimately just done the thing with the minion
[06:21:57.080 --> 06:22:01.720]  So when you know thresh starts hook you can still play up right I can play up I can play aggressive
[06:22:07.160 --> 06:22:09.160]  I
[06:22:20.200 --> 06:22:27.640]  Bad I should have just killed the thresh. This is really bad man. We can't help we can't help
[06:22:30.280 --> 06:22:33.480]  Because the wave the way the wave is going oh, I'm so bad I fucked up
[06:22:33.560 --> 06:22:40.360]  It should be fine, but I still like it were it it fucks us over early game
[06:22:42.680 --> 06:22:44.680]  Because they fucked up very badly
[06:22:46.200 --> 06:22:49.720]  Like I can't stress enough how badly they just fucked up, but it didn't matter
[06:22:51.320 --> 06:22:52.680]  Okay
[06:22:52.680 --> 06:22:54.680]  That's that's happening apparently
[06:22:55.720 --> 06:22:59.720]  Don't worry guys. I'm the best zaya player or kaisa player on the server. It's me
[06:23:03.800 --> 06:23:05.800]  I
[06:23:08.840 --> 06:23:11.080]  Caught I am just literally playing like dog shits
[06:23:26.520 --> 06:23:28.920]  I picked kaisa I just felt like playing her
[06:23:34.440 --> 06:23:39.720]  We got a back we have to leave the wave in a bad spot. Maybe she can push it but like wukong serice
[06:23:49.160 --> 06:23:51.240]  Yeah, we just okay, we got it nice not bad
[06:23:52.520 --> 06:23:55.560]  So we had to push the wave in there, uh, so that the wave will bounce back
[06:23:56.040 --> 06:23:58.120]  But we had to do it on it. It was a really bad timer
[06:23:58.600 --> 06:24:02.520]  Let me just say I I fucked up the entire early game of this game like this games. I'm so bad
[06:24:03.640 --> 06:24:08.440]  Essentially, what should have happened was level one when they walked up when kaisen thresh walked up level one
[06:24:08.920 --> 06:24:11.000]  We should have killed them like I should have just straight up
[06:24:11.720 --> 06:24:16.840]  Hit the thresh with the uh locks because thresh walked into our wave because wukong was level two ganking
[06:24:17.160 --> 06:24:18.280]  Should have just killed him
[06:24:18.280 --> 06:24:21.000]  I grieved that and because I went for the zaya instead
[06:24:21.080 --> 06:24:24.040]  I put myself in a spot where I took like 80 percent of my hp for free
[06:24:24.680 --> 06:24:28.440]  Right which put me behind and now the entire fight was like harder
[06:24:28.760 --> 06:24:32.840]  Because I was low and then we had to wait for the way it was just it was really bad
[06:24:34.280 --> 06:24:35.720]  Really?
[06:24:35.720 --> 06:24:38.280]  That minion actually just did that
[06:24:42.440 --> 06:24:46.600]  I don't think we can kill this guy unless she can max range land a q or something but yeah
[06:24:52.360 --> 06:24:55.720]  Is zarya the best lady right now? Uh, no, I think jinx is better
[06:24:56.680 --> 06:24:58.040]  I think zarya is good
[06:24:58.040 --> 06:25:01.480]  Uh, her white game she especially with like paired with an enchanter is always insane
[06:25:02.360 --> 06:25:04.840]  But I think jinx is uh better for solo q
[06:25:06.840 --> 06:25:08.840]  Uh, I actually have to flash
[06:25:13.720 --> 06:25:16.280]  That was a good play hook by that guy I disrespected him
[06:25:19.560 --> 06:25:22.360]  I might have to leave because wukong can just go here and dive me
[06:25:25.560 --> 06:25:30.120]  I actually just have to leave this feels so bad you see how wukong just used the plants
[06:25:32.120 --> 06:25:35.800]  If I stay I can just die right so I'm just misplaying all over the place
[06:25:36.360 --> 06:25:39.080]  I'm taking too much damage. We're playing weak side right now, right?
[06:25:39.880 --> 06:25:43.640]  What I mean by that is like we know our dianna's top and we know their wukong's bot
[06:25:44.200 --> 06:25:46.920]  So because of that I need to play a lot less
[06:25:46.920 --> 06:25:50.920]  Trady like I walked up and just let the thresh flame me for free and I missed two waves now
[06:25:51.320 --> 06:25:53.880]  I need to not do that because if I don't miss these waves
[06:25:53.960 --> 06:25:58.200]  It doesn't matter for weak siding because I'm not behind so it's it's just really stupid
[06:26:01.880 --> 06:26:06.840]  Now what I do want to do is I want to go check and see if the wukong's like on our camps or something
[06:26:07.240 --> 06:26:09.240]  Or if he's doing dragon or some shits
[06:26:12.520 --> 06:26:17.080]  Okay, I should not have used the blast cone dude. I am so bad
[06:26:18.520 --> 06:26:20.520]  I used the blast cone to just hit it
[06:26:20.840 --> 06:26:24.120]  It's playing support man. It makes your it makes your brain smaller
[06:26:25.560 --> 06:26:27.560]  Actually
[06:26:31.480 --> 06:26:33.480]  I
[06:26:41.080 --> 06:26:43.080]  I swear playing support makes my brain smaller
[06:26:51.080 --> 06:26:53.080]  Oh, they're in dragon
[06:27:01.480 --> 06:27:03.480]  I
[06:27:12.920 --> 06:27:15.960]  Ziya's trolling I think
[06:27:18.520 --> 06:27:20.520]  Pretty sure I just freeze this no with the lux
[06:27:25.720 --> 06:27:27.720]  Yeah, she's just trolling I don't know what the fuck that was
[06:27:27.960 --> 06:27:34.680]  I took a little bit of damage, but she has to overextend now
[06:27:34.680 --> 06:27:36.680]  I
[06:27:56.120 --> 06:27:58.120]  Not bad, okay, so
[06:27:58.200 --> 06:28:03.320]  Does I wanted to back the reason that I froze that was because I wants to back but she can't back until we push the wave in
[06:28:04.200 --> 06:28:09.560]  Or until they push the wave in right so it gives me time to kind of catch up on my back timer with ziya
[06:28:10.440 --> 06:28:12.440]  Because I'm you know a little bit behind in farm
[06:28:20.920 --> 06:28:26.920]  Uh thresh is definitely going to go mid here. He's either going to go mid or he's going to try and hook us from the bush
[06:28:28.760 --> 06:28:33.000]  I think I'm going to shoot my w through all of the bushes here. Okay thresh isn't in the bushes
[06:28:33.800 --> 06:28:36.600]  He's just me. Uh, yeah, we don't know where he is
[06:28:37.560 --> 06:28:39.560]  This is awkward because I can't really walk up
[06:28:41.480 --> 06:28:43.800]  I mean, I guess I'm almost sick. So I guess I could walk up
[06:28:45.560 --> 06:28:47.560]  Yeah, there he is. Okay, we see him
[06:28:52.440 --> 06:28:58.440]  He is level five so it's we could probably actually fight like if this guy lands a binding I might be able to just trade
[06:29:03.880 --> 06:29:06.920]  I just I am I'm dead
[06:29:10.600 --> 06:29:12.920]  I suck honestly I I needed to my bad
[06:29:15.960 --> 06:29:17.960]  I'm playing bad that's on me
[06:29:19.560 --> 06:29:21.800]  The locks is playing so good. I needed to uh
[06:29:22.760 --> 06:29:26.280]  W but then back up after the bind. I've just I'm mechanically
[06:29:27.080 --> 06:29:29.480]  Shitting on myself right now like out of my mouth. Just shit
[06:29:29.480 --> 06:29:31.480]  I have no idea what looks just
[06:29:33.000 --> 06:29:36.760]  Because I knew exactly what was going to happen when I used w in front of the fucking thresh's face. I was like
[06:29:37.640 --> 06:29:39.640]  Here we go. You know what I mean?
[06:29:39.880 --> 06:29:43.480]  Technically we're both six and he's five but he doesn't matter because if I get hooked
[06:29:44.280 --> 06:29:46.280]  I don't have enough damage. So
[06:29:47.720 --> 06:29:49.720]  Now here
[06:29:53.560 --> 06:29:59.240]  I'm gonna walk up and see if I can stop this zyus back. Maybe I mean, she's backing in a weird spot
[06:30:00.360 --> 06:30:04.520]  Yeah, we stopped their backs huge. Okay now they're in trouble
[06:30:06.360 --> 06:30:07.960]  so
[06:30:07.960 --> 06:30:09.960]  They really needed the back on that timer
[06:30:11.160 --> 06:30:15.960]  Because they just want to fight right and because they just want to fight they want to go back, right?
[06:30:17.880 --> 06:30:19.880]  No way
[06:30:22.600 --> 06:30:26.040]  Dude fuck off. I cannot dodge a hook right now to save my fucking life
[06:30:27.320 --> 06:30:29.080]  Jesus christ
[06:30:29.080 --> 06:30:31.080]  What is my movement man?
[06:30:33.720 --> 06:30:35.720]  Like tilting myself right now
[06:30:42.600 --> 06:30:45.240]  I want to stay for this wave but mid is mia
[06:30:47.880 --> 06:30:49.880]  Yeah, I can't
[06:30:50.760 --> 06:30:52.440]  It feels so bad
[06:30:52.440 --> 06:30:54.920]  Because I needed one more wave to get double pickaxe
[06:30:55.720 --> 06:30:57.480]  So I can get my upgrade
[06:30:57.480 --> 06:31:01.320]  Because like normally you go noon quiver pickaxe pickaxe and if you go noon pick pick
[06:31:02.040 --> 06:31:05.240]  It gives you enough ad to get your q upgrade, right? And that's like the whole point
[06:31:05.240 --> 06:31:08.440]  You don't need cracking you just need your q upgrade because your q upgrades when you start bursting
[06:31:09.640 --> 06:31:14.200]  But because I got hooked under the turrets even though we got a kill I had to back and I couldn't get my timer
[06:31:17.640 --> 06:31:19.640]  I'm so trash
[06:31:24.920 --> 06:31:31.160]  I need some coffee that's one of those men. I swear to god coffee is my savior. It'll save me
[06:31:55.800 --> 06:31:57.800]  This world is changing
[06:32:00.680 --> 06:32:06.760]  That wave actually just did that to me holy shit, we don't actually have to do anything here crazy
[06:32:19.080 --> 06:32:21.080]  Nice well played
[06:32:25.160 --> 06:32:27.160]  Nice
[06:32:38.600 --> 06:32:41.960]  Nice nice nice that was a good to be to
[06:32:41.960 --> 06:32:43.960]  You
[06:32:50.280 --> 06:32:56.680]  All right, I got my q upgrade now we're chilling oh now we're how much Ellen oh, yeah, baby
[06:33:01.800 --> 06:33:06.040]  You know what it is it's like uh, I'm playing the fights too quick
[06:33:06.760 --> 06:33:08.760]  I
[06:33:11.800 --> 06:33:14.280]  Just got to slow down and like think I'm like too hyped up
[06:33:26.280 --> 06:33:31.480]  I really don't want to miss this wave there's a person right there. Oh shit, let's go
[06:33:31.800 --> 06:33:35.960]  Yeah, he's dead. Okay, I'm gonna go farm bot. Well that guy gets that
[06:33:40.680 --> 06:33:42.680]  This locks is really good
[06:33:52.200 --> 06:33:54.280]  I kind of want to oh, I can't get this plate fuck
[06:33:56.600 --> 06:34:00.440]  What what that was bs
[06:34:01.800 --> 06:34:03.800]  I
[06:34:05.320 --> 06:34:09.640]  Okay, you know what I'll just take my entire HP bar really quick on the turret it's not a big deal guys
[06:34:11.240 --> 06:34:16.680]  I'm just I'm that good at the game like I don't mean to brag but like you know professional gamer over here like you know
[06:34:19.320 --> 06:34:21.320]  I'm gonna be the one some lessons like I got you

[06:34:46.760 --> 06:34:49.880]  Wait you son of a bitch
[06:34:51.880 --> 06:34:53.880]  I mean she's dead but
[06:35:07.640 --> 06:35:09.640]  Okay, I'll play man
[06:35:13.160 --> 06:35:15.160]  Motherfucker
[06:35:21.960 --> 06:35:23.960]  Yeah
[06:35:26.760 --> 06:35:28.760]  All right, they forfeit it nice
[06:35:33.080 --> 06:35:39.160]  Well, I need to make some coffee I'm playing give me a sec we're playing real bad. I need some coffee
[06:35:51.400 --> 06:35:59.880]  Nice though we hit 400 LP let's go so now we just need 150 more we need 550 I think 550 is GM
[06:36:12.840 --> 06:36:14.920]  I didn't do anything that game by the way, I did nothing
[06:36:16.600 --> 06:36:18.600]  I could play another ad carry game that was fun
[06:36:19.560 --> 06:36:21.560]  I'm gonna grab some coffee. I'll be right back
[06:36:23.080 --> 06:36:25.800]  Talks amongst yourselves boys. I believe in you
[06:36:27.160 --> 06:36:30.440]  You can look at my ad carry tier list that we've been trying to figure out how to do
[06:36:31.400 --> 06:36:34.280]  Enjoy I'll be ready grab some coffee. Oh
[06:36:35.800 --> 06:36:37.800]  Fucking
[06:36:48.600 --> 06:36:50.600]  You
[06:37:18.600 --> 06:37:21.560]  You
[06:37:48.600 --> 06:37:50.600]  You
[06:38:16.200 --> 06:38:18.200]  All right, I'm back
[06:38:19.000 --> 06:38:21.000]  Let's go
[06:38:21.560 --> 06:38:23.560]  The book
[06:38:23.880 --> 06:38:25.880]  Sweet
[06:38:26.200 --> 06:38:28.200]  Be back boys
[06:38:31.400 --> 06:38:33.400]  We back
[06:38:38.680 --> 06:38:40.680]  Time is at five. Oh
[06:38:40.920 --> 06:38:45.320]  I probably play for like another hour and then I gotta get off and make some dinner
[06:38:46.120 --> 06:38:49.320]  Do some other shit, you know what I'm saying
[06:38:58.520 --> 06:39:02.440]  Where were we oh, yeah, we're making the tier list. Yeah, I think Varys is really good a
[06:39:03.720 --> 06:39:05.800]  I think Varys is good a tier because um
[06:39:07.320 --> 06:39:08.520]  In my opinion
[06:39:08.520 --> 06:39:11.880]  Varys is never really like a bad pick almost like sometimes he's bad
[06:39:11.960 --> 06:39:15.960]  But I think he's just you can play him on hit or you can play him without he right?
[06:39:15.960 --> 06:39:18.760]  So he's got two builds that you can do based on the game in the team comp
[06:39:19.160 --> 06:39:21.160]  His ulti is pretty much always useful
[06:39:22.120 --> 06:39:25.960]  Like just having a stun like a root on a champion is always going to be useful right?
[06:39:26.200 --> 06:39:31.400]  Then you have he's got very long range like engage. You can safely kill people with his ult in his queue
[06:39:31.880 --> 06:39:35.560]  Uh, you can build him poke where like before objectives you can make picks really easily
[06:39:35.560 --> 06:39:37.560]  You can poke people out before the objective get him low
[06:39:38.120 --> 06:39:40.120]  His lane phase is really good if you're
[06:39:40.200 --> 06:39:45.880]  His lane phase is really good if you're if you understand like how to play Varys his lane phase is exceptional. He also has
[06:39:47.800 --> 06:39:50.840]  Uh in the meta currently, I feel like he's just like a good pick
[06:39:51.080 --> 06:39:53.640]  I don't think he's as good as draven and jinx for solo queue
[06:39:54.280 --> 06:39:56.040]  But I do think he's really good
[06:39:56.040 --> 06:39:58.840]  Um in general you can you can climb with them really easily
[06:40:00.040 --> 06:40:02.120]  And then uh, I put ash here too
[06:40:03.160 --> 06:40:05.400]  Maybe ash. I don't know who I'd put in front
[06:40:06.680 --> 06:40:08.360]  Ash or Varys
[06:40:08.360 --> 06:40:13.400]  I feel like maybe ash or maybe Varys. I think ash is really underrated though. I think ash is super super good right now
[06:40:25.960 --> 06:40:28.520]  I think ash is super good uh because
[06:40:29.640 --> 06:40:31.640]  Sorry, I'm trying to think uh
[06:40:32.520 --> 06:40:36.600]  She's basically the same idea as Varys. She's a little different, but she's the same idea. Um
[06:40:38.440 --> 06:40:42.760]  She controls lane phase pretty well. Really her lane isn't too bad. She also has
[06:40:44.840 --> 06:40:48.760]  Like her r always useful no matter what so like you always have use with ash
[06:40:48.840 --> 06:40:53.160]  You'll always have use with Varys r like they they just stuns snares, etc. And solo queue
[06:40:53.880 --> 06:40:58.200]  Uh, she's also really good at being annoying in teamfights like you can take ghost on ash and you can just
[06:40:58.680 --> 06:41:01.720]  Voli sit outside their range and if you just be basically solo people
[06:41:02.280 --> 06:41:04.600]  And she actually has decent scaling on her crit now. So
[06:41:05.320 --> 06:41:08.200]  You can go a bunch of builds too. Like I think you can go bork ash
[06:41:08.360 --> 06:41:14.040]  You can go crack and slayer ash into bork or you could go crack and slayer into i.e. Or you can go crack and slayer into like
[06:41:15.640 --> 06:41:18.440]  Whatever you can go shield bow ash if they have tanks you can go gale force that
[06:41:18.440 --> 06:41:21.400]  Oh, you can just do a lot of different builds on ash and I think she's really versatile
[06:41:21.800 --> 06:41:24.200]  You can also just go the on head build if you really want. I
[06:41:24.840 --> 06:41:28.440]  I think the rageblade build sucks personally. I think that if I was gonna go on hit I would just be like
[06:41:28.920 --> 06:41:30.920]  shield bow wits and into like
[06:41:31.240 --> 06:41:36.280]  Bork or some shit if I was actually gonna do that or shield bow bork or bork wits or whatever, but
[06:41:37.400 --> 06:41:39.400]  Yeah
[06:41:41.000 --> 06:41:43.480]  Uh, I don't know Ezreal is probably a tier two
[06:41:45.080 --> 06:41:47.240]  I said Ezreal is really gated by like skill
[06:41:48.120 --> 06:41:51.960]  So I don't want to put him in I think if you could play Ezreal perfectly
[06:41:51.960 --> 06:41:53.560]  He'd be at the top of s like he would just be
[06:41:54.280 --> 06:41:55.560]  Above jinx
[06:41:55.560 --> 06:42:01.880]  Just best champion of the game if you could if you could never miss a skill shot like 100 accuracy playing perfect like the champ's insane
[06:42:01.960 --> 06:42:02.840]  Right
[06:42:02.840 --> 06:42:05.400]  It's absolutely crazy how good that champ is if he could play him perfect
[06:42:05.480 --> 06:42:07.800]  But you're like people are humans etc
[06:42:08.360 --> 06:42:12.680]  So I think he's like an a tier pick in solo queue because you can get countered like he's not blindable
[06:42:12.760 --> 06:42:14.760]  You can get countered pretty easily by good players
[06:42:15.320 --> 06:42:17.800]  People play like push comps people play dive comps
[06:42:18.440 --> 06:42:22.760]  Like early game. I mean in lane and shits like because Ezreal's lane is like not it's not bad
[06:42:23.160 --> 06:42:26.360]  But it's very difficult to play Ezreal well in lane fate
[06:42:26.360 --> 06:42:32.040]  You got to be good mechanically and I don't think even like I've seen like challenger players who can't play Ezreal so
[06:42:33.320 --> 06:42:35.320]  He's not easy
[06:42:35.640 --> 06:42:37.640]  You know what I'm saying
[06:42:49.480 --> 06:42:51.480]  What's up boys
[06:42:52.760 --> 06:42:54.760]  So
[06:43:15.400 --> 06:43:19.800]  I was gonna be in kindred but I couldn't find her I hate kindred
[06:43:22.760 --> 06:43:27.320]  Yo, how we doing tonight? How's everybody's day?
[06:43:46.760 --> 06:43:48.760]  Okay, so this guy's picking thresh again
[06:43:53.000 --> 06:43:55.000]  You
[06:44:07.240 --> 06:44:09.960]  Thresh into recon thresh is actually pretty good in the recon
[06:44:09.960 --> 06:44:21.960]  They have xyre thresh again
[06:44:40.920 --> 06:44:42.920]  Let's play jinx
[06:44:44.840 --> 06:44:46.840]  I like jinx here
[06:44:47.320 --> 06:44:52.040]  Even though it is against the rush jinx is a little scary right, but I kind of like her in this situation
[06:44:59.320 --> 06:45:04.520]  See what runs do I want free boots? No, I think I want I want to be able to get early boots this game
[06:45:07.480 --> 06:45:09.480]  Because their team comp is like
[06:45:10.120 --> 06:45:13.480]  Oh, yeah, their team comp is really really annoying. So I kind of want to get
[06:45:15.560 --> 06:45:17.560]  Early boots
[06:45:17.640 --> 06:45:20.680]  I'll probably go present some mines
[06:45:21.640 --> 06:45:23.640]  Although I think over hill isn't bad
[06:45:27.400 --> 06:45:29.400]  Actually, I'll go over hill
[06:45:29.960 --> 06:45:33.480]  So the yeah, let's these these runes look good actually let's do this
[06:45:35.320 --> 06:45:37.320]  What this this
[06:45:38.040 --> 06:45:40.040]  This
[06:45:43.000 --> 06:45:49.640]  Yeah, this is good. Okay. I kind of like these this is good. I'm gonna use these. Okay. I'm taking clients this game because
[06:45:50.600 --> 06:45:54.680]  They have lasandra and pantheon and thresh right so with lasandra pantheon and thresh
[06:45:56.760 --> 06:46:00.680]  The game's gonna be like really fast of like okay if they stun me
[06:46:00.680 --> 06:46:04.360]  I'm just gonna get cc chained and I'm just gonna die like after a bit right
[06:46:04.920 --> 06:46:07.720]  It's gonna be like a stunning. They're starting. They're starting. They're starting. I'm just gonna die
[06:46:11.400 --> 06:46:13.400]  So I'm like nah, fuck that shit
[06:46:13.400 --> 06:46:15.400]  All right
[06:46:40.200 --> 06:46:42.200]  Let's see if we can get this w boys
[06:46:43.560 --> 06:46:45.560]  I'm trying to kill
[06:46:49.640 --> 06:46:52.140]  Let's see if I can not fuck up the first three levels the lane
[06:46:56.360 --> 06:46:59.400]  Chatterstricted. Oh, yeah, it's for a while
[06:47:03.480 --> 06:47:08.840]  It's riot secret code to make it so I can actually play the game and climb without chatting
[06:47:13.800 --> 06:47:15.800]  I
[06:47:28.040 --> 06:47:30.760]  Okay, I should have warded this bush
[06:47:33.640 --> 06:47:39.320]  I was drinking my coffee. I didn't think about it. But yeah, if you guys are against the hook champ, uh, always ward this bush
[06:47:39.640 --> 06:47:44.760]  Right like right here you're gonna want to
[06:47:46.040 --> 06:47:48.120]  Ward here early against the most hook champions
[06:47:49.240 --> 06:47:51.560]  Because it gives you a very nice
[06:47:52.280 --> 06:47:55.480]  Like they can't walk in here and cheese you they can't walk in here and cheese you
[06:47:56.120 --> 06:47:58.360]  So you just don't get cheesed by anything
[06:48:10.120 --> 06:48:12.120]  I
[06:48:25.640 --> 06:48:27.640]  Mean that's just
[06:48:30.200 --> 06:48:32.200]  I don't even know what I just saw
[06:48:33.000 --> 06:48:35.240]  I'll be real. I don't know what the fuck just happened. But okay
[06:48:36.680 --> 06:48:38.680]  Trying to push this wave as fast as I can
[06:48:39.480 --> 06:48:41.980]  I'm not sure I can actually get it pushed fast enough, but we're gonna try
[06:48:52.600 --> 06:48:54.600]  Damn it was close
[06:48:59.720 --> 06:49:02.840]  No, I'm gonna let it just push it's not a huge deal
[06:49:03.960 --> 06:49:05.960]  It was very close though
[06:49:06.120 --> 06:49:08.360]  We can just break the freeze, right? Like it's not a huge deal
[06:49:09.880 --> 06:49:11.880]  Are
[06:49:12.440 --> 06:49:14.440]  They supposed to win level one
[06:49:14.440 --> 06:49:15.960]  It depends. I mean
[06:49:15.960 --> 06:49:17.960]  Ziya's not that good level one like
[06:49:18.600 --> 06:49:24.200]  She Ziya's good because she has her feathers, right? But if you can't stack your feathers level one jinx has more damage
[06:49:25.000 --> 06:49:27.240]  And they stacked up for my gat or for my rockets
[06:49:27.320 --> 06:49:34.120]  So I got like I full stacked my lethal tempo and I just double aoe rocketed them over and over and over and over again, right?
[06:49:34.280 --> 06:49:40.680]  And so when they finally all end they were just behind an hp
[06:49:42.120 --> 06:49:44.620]  Also thresh missed he only had flay
[06:50:04.600 --> 06:50:14.920]  Damn that was so close man like actually
[06:50:15.640 --> 06:50:17.640]  Okay
[06:50:29.880 --> 06:50:34.220]  If thresh had died there or not thresh it graves to died there we just win the game
[06:50:45.320 --> 06:50:51.000]  Yeah, this isn't good. Oh, I'm gonna get flayed. I'm dead
[06:50:52.520 --> 06:50:55.240]  Maybe oh, maybe I'm not dead. I have to walk up like this
[06:50:57.160 --> 06:51:00.360]  It was a really bad fight by the what what am I watching what the fuck
[06:51:02.200 --> 06:51:04.200]  That was just a bad fight because um
[06:51:05.720 --> 06:51:09.480]  We knew graves was bought and we knew that he was gonna kill in the jungle, right?
[06:51:10.440 --> 06:51:14.280]  So like my jungler already got outplayed by graves once top side
[06:51:14.760 --> 06:51:19.960]  You shouldn't ever take another fight like that bot side. You should just take the win, right? Like I rotated
[06:51:21.000 --> 06:51:24.360]  Now granted the rakan should have been there to help kill the graves
[06:51:24.920 --> 06:51:27.880]  Like when I rotated rakan was still jacking off in lane
[06:51:28.440 --> 06:51:33.400]  Right like when I was here rakan was like way down here. So the support should have rotated first
[06:51:34.680 --> 06:51:37.240]  Right like I rotated but the support should have been the one rotating
[06:51:37.240 --> 06:51:42.280]  But again, he's just a lot of the time you have support players who don't understand timers and how to help
[06:51:42.520 --> 06:51:44.120]  Nobody plays for jungle
[06:51:44.120 --> 06:51:46.280]  support players hate playing for jungle in low elo
[06:51:47.080 --> 06:51:48.200]  so
[06:51:48.200 --> 06:51:50.200]  It's just not a thing
[06:51:50.360 --> 06:51:54.600]  So I tried to go over and help him, but I misplaced my traps a little bit
[06:51:56.360 --> 06:51:59.400]  And then the graves had a flash, but he got away
[06:52:00.840 --> 06:52:04.600]  And uh, they tried to go in again when I was too low to actually help
[06:52:05.480 --> 06:52:07.960]  We we just got lucky we didn't lose the game off that shit
[06:52:12.120 --> 06:52:14.620]  Kind of does suck though Zyos really strong now
[06:52:29.480 --> 06:52:32.920]  Oh, not bad. I should have oh I should have I could have killed her
[06:52:34.600 --> 06:52:36.600]  I supposed I could have killed the guy
[06:52:38.040 --> 06:52:40.040]  No joke. I totally could have killed him
[06:52:41.000 --> 06:52:44.600]  If I had warded the lantern as he tried to take it I would have killed the zaya
[06:52:46.920 --> 06:52:48.920]  Could she ego'd the lantern there
[06:52:58.520 --> 06:53:02.280]  She ego'd the lantern so hard if I had if I had warded it she dies there
[06:53:02.600 --> 06:53:04.600]  That's my bad
[06:53:15.240 --> 06:53:17.240]  This game's really interesting because
[06:53:18.840 --> 06:53:20.840]  The enemy ball lanes actually misplaying a lot
[06:53:21.880 --> 06:53:26.440]  Like they're they're really really really misplaying these fights and trades and shit, but uh
[06:53:27.400 --> 06:53:29.400]  We can't abuse it
[06:53:30.360 --> 06:53:32.840]  Because the graves has so much control of the game right now
[06:53:33.480 --> 06:53:38.440]  That we have to basically play safe permanently at the moment and I can't do anything to help my team
[06:53:39.000 --> 06:53:41.000]  It feels really bad
[06:53:47.160 --> 06:53:49.160]  One of my guys again. Yeah, there we went
[06:53:56.680 --> 06:53:59.240]  See little graves have bought again man, this is so rough
[06:53:59.400 --> 06:54:01.400]  I
[06:54:08.520 --> 06:54:10.520]  Graves is man
[06:54:13.640 --> 06:54:15.640]  I want to kill this as fast as I can
[06:54:25.640 --> 06:54:27.640]  We can fight these guys to be to actually
[06:54:30.360 --> 06:54:32.360]  Wait, why didn't he just go in?
[06:54:41.960 --> 06:54:43.960]  I don't know why he didn't just double you immediately
[06:54:44.680 --> 06:54:46.840]  Like the rakan waited. Oh that helped me
[06:54:47.720 --> 06:54:51.880]  Like when she was against the wall here, he should have immediately w'd her
[06:54:54.280 --> 06:54:55.800]  Because
[06:54:55.800 --> 06:54:58.920]  If he w's from vision there, right and and she's against the wall
[06:54:59.560 --> 06:55:01.400]  It helps us so much
[06:55:01.400 --> 06:55:04.520]  Because then I can I can overlay my flame chomps on top of the
[06:55:05.880 --> 06:55:08.680]  I can overlay my flame chomps directly on top of the zaya
[06:55:09.480 --> 06:55:12.520]  Right as the fights happening rather than like having to
[06:55:13.320 --> 06:55:16.040]  Work around the fight because thresh is in my face type shit, you know
[06:55:20.520 --> 06:55:23.480]  So we're just we're honestly just losing because we're not pulling the trigger fast enough
[06:55:25.720 --> 06:55:28.520]  And we can't play aggressive when we can pull the trigger
[06:55:29.640 --> 06:55:35.240]  Right like we're losing because we can't pull the trigger fast enough and when we can't pull the trigger. It's uh the wrong time
[06:55:38.360 --> 06:55:42.280]  We do this right now we we get dragon the bot lane back do we get dragon here?
[06:55:49.080 --> 06:55:52.600]  I want to go uh, I actually want to go
[06:55:52.600 --> 06:55:54.600]  Oh
[06:55:56.120 --> 06:55:59.240]  Wait the enemy bot lane didn't back okay, they're trolling
[06:56:03.080 --> 06:56:07.480]  They lost an objective for free here. This is really good. So the enemy bot lane we fight this by the way
[06:56:07.480 --> 06:56:09.480]  We just we can just straight up fight
[06:56:10.040 --> 06:56:12.040]  Oh
[06:56:18.920 --> 06:56:22.680]  That right there is how you lantern how you've worn a lantern by the way
[06:56:25.400 --> 06:56:27.400]  Oh, I did that guy's so dirty
[06:56:32.280 --> 06:56:34.280]  Oh, I'm dead. Bye guys
[06:56:39.800 --> 06:56:47.160]  I didn't know pantheon was Mia. That was my bad. I was like going I was too happy with warding the lantern
[06:56:49.720 --> 06:56:51.720]  My bad
[06:56:55.320 --> 06:56:58.600]  I can't believe the enemy team greeted that hard though for gold
[06:57:02.840 --> 06:57:04.840]  Oh, that's actually nuts to me
[06:57:09.560 --> 06:57:14.680]  No, yeah the the zaias egoing like crazy
[06:57:16.360 --> 06:57:21.560]  The problem is I can't abuse it constantly because like obviously like I need teammates, right?
[06:57:22.680 --> 06:57:27.800]  But I can kind of abuse it like uh, but it's much harder by yourself
[06:57:31.960 --> 06:57:35.160]  Because as you can see like I'm not playing poorly, but we're getting like
[06:57:36.280 --> 06:57:38.120]  We're getting shit on
[06:57:38.120 --> 06:57:40.120]  Shitons a bad word. We're getting like
[06:57:56.040 --> 06:57:58.040]  Oh, come on man
[06:58:00.840 --> 06:58:02.840]  They misplayed that so badly
[06:58:03.400 --> 06:58:06.360]  But rakan just ate the fucking
[06:58:07.160 --> 06:58:13.320]  Whatever, I'm not gonna blame rakan. It's fun. I'm still sad about that though. They misplayed that so incredibly badly
[06:58:14.600 --> 06:58:16.600]  Like so badly
[06:58:16.760 --> 06:58:19.960]  It was just that like Rick Han all into the thresh with his ultimate
[06:58:20.360 --> 06:58:22.360]  but all he had to do there was
[06:58:22.760 --> 06:58:26.200]  Use his e to come back to me and then play front to back afterward
[06:58:26.440 --> 06:58:28.600]  But he's he he sat there auto-wing the thresh
[06:58:29.320 --> 06:58:35.880]  But you you don't need to auto him you just need to engage and then I can maybe play after it
[06:58:40.040 --> 06:58:42.920]  I probably could have double killed them there too. I kind of messed up
[06:58:45.880 --> 06:58:50.920]  My team wants out it's not it's it's silly because the game's not even over
[06:58:55.000 --> 06:58:57.480]  Like we actually can win this game so incredibly easily
[06:58:58.680 --> 06:59:00.840]  So easily if we just play it correctly
[06:59:01.480 --> 06:59:03.480]  Because their bot lane is really fucking bad
[06:59:04.040 --> 06:59:08.040]  I didn't want to be mean, but I'll just be mean their bot lane is really fucking bad
[06:59:15.640 --> 06:59:18.200]  Well, I'm dead they're still bad
[06:59:20.280 --> 06:59:22.680]  I'm just egoing. That was my ego
[06:59:25.080 --> 06:59:27.080]  I still stand by it. I still think they're bad
[06:59:27.800 --> 06:59:33.400]  This guy's just playing 1v3 mid the thresh has not been mid one time. So it must be the top laner
[06:59:38.840 --> 06:59:41.480]  I'm I am so frustrated right now with this game
[06:59:45.880 --> 06:59:52.520]  Because I feel like we should have won so many all-ins that we didn't win barely like one like barely right like barely didn't win small
[06:59:52.520 --> 06:59:54.520]  Inns I feel like we should have won all of them
[06:59:54.600 --> 07:00:00.760]  Like they they didn't land like a good all-in once thresh didn't land a single hook once
[07:00:02.680 --> 07:00:07.480]  And this is my rakan like he just tried to he just used his r to try and engage
[07:00:13.240 --> 07:00:15.560]  I think nocturne is done mentally
[07:00:19.400 --> 07:00:21.400]  Okay, so in games like this
[07:00:22.120 --> 07:00:24.120]  Like this thrash is so bad
[07:00:47.000 --> 07:00:49.000]  Oh, let's go, baby
[07:00:49.720 --> 07:00:51.720]  Huge
[07:00:55.640 --> 07:00:57.640]  That was so huge let's fucking go
[07:00:57.640 --> 07:00:59.640]  Like
[07:01:15.400 --> 07:01:21.080]  Like I I'm gonna hit no at 15 because dude, I really don't want to lose to this thrash in asiah
[07:01:22.760 --> 07:01:26.600]  Like this thrash is doing the most the most ego shit I've ever seen
[07:01:27.960 --> 07:01:32.680]  And he's just getting away with shit like right there thresh walks up whiffs every spell
[07:01:34.360 --> 07:01:40.520]  And expects to get away with that shit. No, no, no we win these we win these trust give me let me cook let me cook
[07:01:41.800 --> 07:01:43.800]  I see my team to let me cook a bit, you know
[07:01:44.840 --> 07:01:49.000]  Like we had a bad early game had to play weak side. Let me cook. Let me cook
[07:01:50.760 --> 07:01:52.760]  We are chilling
[07:01:57.800 --> 07:01:59.800]  Oh
[07:02:23.880 --> 07:02:25.880]  If I landed that that would have been sick
[07:02:27.640 --> 07:02:29.640]  I
[07:02:48.680 --> 07:02:50.680]  Damn
[07:02:53.720 --> 07:02:55.720]  Thresh is top two we can kill this guy
[07:02:58.600 --> 07:03:07.800]  Come on guys don't forfeit guys the game is winnable. Oh my god
[07:03:09.160 --> 07:03:12.360]  Dude the game is how is the rakan gonna forfeit?
[07:03:14.760 --> 07:03:17.560]  Dude that game is so winnable it hurts
[07:03:18.280 --> 07:03:20.280]  Uh
[07:03:22.920 --> 07:03:24.920]  Like dude really
[07:03:25.160 --> 07:03:30.040]  That actually is so infuriating
[07:03:33.320 --> 07:03:39.080]  That's so infuriating man that game was so incredibly winnable like look at this
[07:03:41.640 --> 07:03:44.360]  I did more damage than every single player on the enemy team
[07:03:45.560 --> 07:03:47.560]  If my team just relaxed
[07:03:48.920 --> 07:03:52.280]  We win the game a thousand times over that game
[07:03:53.080 --> 07:03:55.080]  Like the game is over
[07:03:55.960 --> 07:03:59.720]  We have a rakan a rumble and a wukong for me to sit and sit behind
[07:04:00.520 --> 07:04:05.320]  And we saw how bad their bot lane was right. I have quens for the only way they can kill me
[07:04:07.160 --> 07:04:12.680]  Whatever man, dude, I wish to god i'm gonna report them all like these fuckers. I guarantee I get a notification
[07:04:13.160 --> 07:04:15.160]  There's no way these people are not toxic
[07:04:17.400 --> 07:04:21.240]  There's no way you in this like you just want out of the game after a fucking
[07:04:21.880 --> 07:04:23.880]  Your team is just doing well
[07:04:25.320 --> 07:04:28.200]  Nah man the score is 10 to 14
[07:04:29.480 --> 07:04:31.480]  10 to 14
[07:04:33.960 --> 07:04:35.960]  You have a fed 80 carry
[07:04:41.320 --> 07:04:45.480]  Look at this dude we forfeited we were down 2.5k
[07:04:46.120 --> 07:04:52.760]  We had a better scaling comp than them like we outscaled them
[07:04:54.840 --> 07:04:57.640]  We have two dragons we outscale them
[07:04:58.760 --> 07:05:00.760]  And we're down 2.5k
[07:05:02.280 --> 07:05:04.680]  And my team rage hits forfeit
[07:05:06.440 --> 07:05:12.040]  Oh my god, that's so gross that is so disgusting
[07:05:15.720 --> 07:05:17.720]  So disgusting
[07:05:21.720 --> 07:05:23.720]  Why am I in a game
[07:05:24.760 --> 07:05:25.960]  With this player
[07:05:26.360 --> 07:05:29.560]  I'm 412 LP masters
[07:05:30.840 --> 07:05:35.640]  I was in a game just now with a 7 LP masters jungler
[07:05:37.720 --> 07:05:40.920]  And he's not on a smurf this is not a smurf account
[07:05:41.720 --> 07:05:44.680]  Because last season this guy was d4
[07:05:46.120 --> 07:05:50.200]  So he's not on a smurf. Why is this player in my game?
[07:05:53.240 --> 07:05:55.640]  Why is this player in a 400 LP master game?
[07:05:57.880 --> 07:06:01.240]  Why? Or rather why am I in a diamond one game?
[07:06:06.680 --> 07:06:08.680]  You can go to his previous game
[07:06:09.640 --> 07:06:12.680]  You can go to his previous games. He doesn't even have good MMR
[07:06:13.400 --> 07:06:17.480]  Like if you look at these games, they're all like what 100 200 LP, right?
[07:06:18.280 --> 07:06:21.000]  Why am I in this game? Why did you put me in a game with this player?
[07:06:23.080 --> 07:06:25.320]  Like this guy, I don't even care if he sucks
[07:06:25.480 --> 07:06:27.960]  I'm more frustrated the fact that these players
[07:06:28.440 --> 07:06:31.480]  Mental boom at the first sign of any negativity. Look at this
[07:06:32.920 --> 07:06:36.120]  They just give up first sign of anything negative they go next
[07:06:37.080 --> 07:06:40.840]  Like I actually could have won v9 to this game too like actually
[07:06:41.320 --> 07:06:46.920]  But I I'm not allowed to try and 1v9 because my team once out of the game at fucking four minutes or 15 minutes
[07:06:47.720 --> 07:06:49.720]  That sucks man
[07:06:50.520 --> 07:06:52.520]  The new system is trash
[07:06:52.920 --> 07:06:57.400]  Like I'm sorry, but the the forfeit 15 system is good sometimes
[07:06:58.360 --> 07:07:02.840]  They should have a requirement that you have to be losing by x amount of gold for it to kick in
[07:07:03.880 --> 07:07:05.880]  That should that should be it
[07:07:05.880 --> 07:07:07.640]  They should have a requirement
[07:07:07.640 --> 07:07:10.840]  You have to be losing by 5k plus for it to work at 15
[07:07:14.280 --> 07:07:16.280]  Like there needs to be something
[07:07:16.680 --> 07:07:20.680]  Where there's a requirement because people are so stupid
[07:07:21.400 --> 07:07:28.280]  Right like that game was 100 hours. We had two dragons. We're down 2000 gold at 16 minutes and
[07:07:28.840 --> 07:07:32.840]  Wukong's three and one we were down four kills Wukong's three and one
[07:07:36.840 --> 07:07:40.120]  I'm I'm I'm literally insanely strong
[07:07:41.320 --> 07:07:46.440]  Even though we got weak sided. I'm still winning. We just 2v2ed them bot side of the map right way. We just wanted 2v2
[07:07:48.440 --> 07:07:50.440]  Rumble's just like like ah
[07:07:51.160 --> 07:07:53.160]  Sorry, I'm just mad. I'm mad
[07:07:53.800 --> 07:07:58.920]  Like they need to require they need to require something other than four people like require four people and
[07:07:59.480 --> 07:08:01.720]  A gold lead or something like that's so cancer
[07:08:02.520 --> 07:08:05.480]  That's so fucking frustrating man
[07:08:07.320 --> 07:08:09.720]  Like I can't believe how bad people's mentals are
[07:08:11.000 --> 07:08:17.320]  Like the okay, I get it the the rumble and the the rumble and the nocturne. I understand wanting to forfeit. Okay?
[07:08:17.880 --> 07:08:21.880]  Okay, they're having a bad game. They want out. They're raging. They need to get their frustration. I get it
[07:08:22.200 --> 07:08:24.200]  But why are we forfeiting?
[07:08:26.840 --> 07:08:29.320]  When Wukong is three and one
[07:08:29.320 --> 07:08:32.920]  I have seven of our kp. I'm the 80 carry. I'm very strong. I just got my mythic
[07:08:33.800 --> 07:08:35.800]  We have two dragons
[07:08:36.360 --> 07:08:39.240]  And rakan's forfeiting two. I don't know man
[07:08:41.000 --> 07:08:43.000]  Ah
[07:08:43.000 --> 07:08:45.000]  That's just frustrating is all
[07:08:49.640 --> 07:08:52.680]  Like I'll be real I carry this game every day of the week
[07:08:54.200 --> 07:08:56.200]  Every day of the week I carry those
[07:08:57.160 --> 07:08:59.160]  Like every day of the week I carry those
[07:08:59.160 --> 07:09:01.160]  So
[07:09:01.560 --> 07:09:03.560]  I
[07:09:25.640 --> 07:09:30.680]  So apparently riot is doing something about smurfing though and I can't wait until they do
[07:09:31.240 --> 07:09:32.280]  this
[07:09:32.280 --> 07:09:36.840]  This is actually a really good thing that I wanted that I wanted to talk about earlier in the stream, but I forgot
[07:09:37.560 --> 07:09:43.080]  Apparently riot is like doing something to make smurfing harder because like apparently smurfing is outrageous right now
[07:09:43.800 --> 07:09:47.400]  and I I kind of think that they need to stop this too
[07:09:48.520 --> 07:09:52.520]  So there's a there's a thing you can do in solo queue right now where
[07:09:53.640 --> 07:09:55.640]  You can make a new account
[07:09:55.960 --> 07:09:57.960]  and you can duo with somebody
[07:09:58.920 --> 07:10:06.120]  On different accounts on a new account and your m mr doesn't actually get like lowered
[07:10:09.000 --> 07:10:12.280]  So if you win a game let's say you win a game
[07:10:14.120 --> 07:10:15.960]  Um
[07:10:15.960 --> 07:10:18.760]  I think this is just him leveling the account, but let's say let's say you win a game
[07:10:19.480 --> 07:10:21.480]  and in that game you
[07:10:22.440 --> 07:10:23.800]  Do
[07:10:23.800 --> 07:10:28.040]  With somebody in a lower m mr right now when you duo in a lower m mr
[07:10:28.040 --> 07:10:29.400]  I don't know if this guy did this or not
[07:10:29.400 --> 07:10:36.440]  But when you do it with somebody in a lower m mr your m mr is based on now the game thinks that you're in that m mr
[07:10:36.760 --> 07:10:38.760]  And you can do it in placements
[07:10:39.000 --> 07:10:43.160]  So in your very first games for some reason there's no m mr lock on placements
[07:10:43.720 --> 07:10:45.720]  So you can in your placements
[07:10:46.840 --> 07:10:48.840]  Duo with somebody who's like
[07:10:49.240 --> 07:10:51.400]  Bronze right and you can play with them
[07:10:52.200 --> 07:10:56.200]  And then the game thinks you're still winning so it keeps amplifying your m mr
[07:10:57.240 --> 07:11:00.840]  So when i'm describing this really poorly, but essentially you can duo in lower elos
[07:11:01.240 --> 07:11:03.960]  And the game doesn't know your m mr belongs
[07:11:04.440 --> 07:11:09.640]  In that elo because you're winning in that elo the game can't figure that out for some reason the algorithm
[07:11:10.280 --> 07:11:12.440]  So when they stopped duo queuing
[07:11:13.080 --> 07:11:15.080]  It still inflated them
[07:11:15.160 --> 07:11:18.440]  It still inflated their m mr to where it would be if they had solo queued
[07:11:19.080 --> 07:11:21.080]  Does that make sense and what i'm saying
[07:11:21.720 --> 07:11:24.840]  So it basically says that they went like 10 and 0 in their placements
[07:11:25.480 --> 07:11:28.040]  Right, so now they're in like a master tier m mr
[07:11:29.000 --> 07:11:31.000]  From a brand new account
[07:11:31.320 --> 07:11:37.000]  So now those people are in like d1 masters m mr, but they played they they won in gold
[07:11:39.320 --> 07:11:41.320]  I also don't think
[07:11:44.040 --> 07:11:46.600]  You smurfing should be so easily accessible
[07:11:49.560 --> 07:11:53.880]  Like this guy's not a bad player per se, but I don't think he's a master tier player
[07:11:54.200 --> 07:11:56.200]  Right like this guy's a rumble player on a new account
[07:11:57.000 --> 07:12:00.840]  I I from that game alone the fact he gave up tells me he's not a good player
[07:12:19.080 --> 07:12:22.840]  Dude, I'm I'm a heavy advocate for like
[07:12:23.640 --> 07:12:25.640]  Riot hat you have to attach
[07:12:25.720 --> 07:12:27.720]  Like a verification to your accounts
[07:12:29.240 --> 07:12:34.360]  I know riot would never do that, but I'm like a heavy advocate for like having to attach verification to play ranked
[07:12:37.480 --> 07:12:39.480]  I think it'd be great honestly
[07:12:41.720 --> 07:12:43.720]  I think it would help so much
[07:12:48.920 --> 07:12:50.920]  If
[07:12:55.080 --> 07:12:57.080]  You get your very very account banner you're done for it. Yeah
[07:12:57.880 --> 07:13:02.600]  You have to get like a vpn to play other than like you would have to that's my point though like
[07:13:03.720 --> 07:13:05.720]  If you get your verified account banned
[07:13:07.000 --> 07:13:09.560]  Right like okay that account's done
[07:13:19.800 --> 07:13:21.800]  You
[07:13:26.040 --> 07:13:29.960]  Like I said, I don't think riot would ever do it because it's too it's too uh
[07:13:30.840 --> 07:13:35.240]  Extreme and I don't think riot has the balls to ever do that shit vpn's only five dollars
[07:13:35.800 --> 07:13:38.600]  Yeah, but dude, are you gonna tell me that you're gonna you're gonna buy it?
[07:13:39.640 --> 07:13:44.600]  People who get banned on accounts typically get banned consistently. That's why they're making smurfs
[07:13:44.840 --> 07:13:46.840]  Right
[07:13:47.160 --> 07:13:52.840]  So you're telling me somebody's gonna be willing to pay five dollars for a new phone number verification or whatever
[07:13:53.880 --> 07:13:56.440]  Every time they have to make a new account. They're not
[07:14:07.480 --> 07:14:09.480]  Not you me
[07:14:09.480 --> 07:14:11.480]  Yeah, yeah, okay
[07:14:11.480 --> 07:14:13.480]  Don't I have smurfs? Yeah, I do
[07:14:14.280 --> 07:14:18.680]  And I stand by all my smurfs should be attached to the same like account
[07:14:19.560 --> 07:14:23.320]  Like if you make a smurf, okay, this is what I think should happen
[07:14:24.360 --> 07:14:27.240]  You should be able to put all of your smurfs on one account
[07:14:27.320 --> 07:14:32.520]  So you you can make smurfs and you can add that smurf verification to an account
[07:14:33.640 --> 07:14:36.040]  But it kind of like battle.net. Does that make sense?
[07:14:36.440 --> 07:14:41.400]  You know how like battle.net has all your accounts in the battle.net thing, but you can sign into battle.net
[07:14:42.040 --> 07:14:45.160]  I think that the way to make make it viable would be like
[07:14:45.640 --> 07:14:49.160]  You could put all if you didn't have a second phone number didn't want one
[07:14:49.480 --> 07:14:51.560]  You could put smurfs up to like a limit
[07:14:51.560 --> 07:14:54.520]  So you could have like three smurfs or like two smurfs and your main account, right?
[07:14:55.000 --> 07:14:57.000]  So you could have like three total accounts
[07:14:57.240 --> 07:15:02.520]  And you you would have to like you could add those to the same like omega account, right?
[07:15:02.600 --> 07:15:04.920]  And that omega account could be your verified account
[07:15:05.240 --> 07:15:10.520]  Now if any of your accounts get punished on your omega account all of your accounts get punished
[07:15:11.560 --> 07:15:17.480]  So if any of your accounts get punished all of them get punished
[07:15:29.800 --> 07:15:31.800]  Like I feel like that'd be a good play
[07:15:32.120 --> 07:15:36.440]  Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like it would work. Yo, what's up rush? I called you rush. What's up, R.F.
[07:15:37.160 --> 07:15:39.160]  I
[07:15:41.320 --> 07:15:46.280]  What do I want to play I don't know I don't know what I want to do here
[07:15:48.840 --> 07:15:54.600]  It's up ranged okay, I wish I didn't have cleanse cleanse is so worthless this game. Wait actually
[07:15:56.600 --> 07:15:58.600]  Cleanse does nothing this game at all
[07:15:59.240 --> 07:16:03.880]  I just down to some like maybe if the brand like tries to flash stun me or some shit
[07:16:04.440 --> 07:16:06.440]  But I'm just like down a summoner
[07:16:18.840 --> 07:16:22.680]  All right boys we got night blue three on our team
[07:16:25.640 --> 07:16:27.640]  Is a throwback
[07:16:33.880 --> 07:16:36.200]  Oh
[07:17:03.880 --> 07:17:05.880]  Oh
[07:17:29.320 --> 07:17:31.320]  We got him
[07:17:34.840 --> 07:17:38.360]  I'm not gonna lie. I kind of looked like I was scripting
[07:17:40.360 --> 07:17:44.120]  That that movement like if I was watching the game I'd be like what the fuck was that
[07:17:46.120 --> 07:17:53.800]  Like my movement was real sus on that like that that all in right there. That's some that's some that's some sus movement
[07:18:04.280 --> 07:18:06.280]  You
[07:18:25.800 --> 07:18:28.680]  We can gank these guys they have no oh there's gonna be a ward in here
[07:18:34.360 --> 07:18:36.360]  I
[07:18:39.240 --> 07:18:41.240]  These people have no flashes
[07:18:41.720 --> 07:18:44.760]  Enemy bot lane has no flash. This should be just be a free kill honestly
[07:18:46.360 --> 07:18:49.960]  We just let these guys push in they can't walk up and we just play for that
[07:18:55.000 --> 07:18:58.680]  Even if they try and 3v3 we should just win the 3v3 because we're stronger
[07:19:04.840 --> 07:19:07.480]  Oh this guy's just dead. Yeah, it's
[07:19:18.280 --> 07:19:20.280]  I need level three
[07:19:23.160 --> 07:19:27.160]  I kind of fucked my entire wave here. Yo, can we push?
[07:19:29.560 --> 07:19:31.560]  Is there any way we can just push this
[07:19:34.440 --> 07:19:36.440]  Oh nice
[07:19:49.960 --> 07:19:56.200]  Nice what plan nice job my Lulu's fucking fetish shit
[07:20:04.360 --> 07:20:08.120]  Oh, I should have gone free boots this game. I didn't think about it
[07:20:10.040 --> 07:20:11.800]  Because uh
[07:20:11.800 --> 07:20:15.720]  I don't need sork this game. You know how like the last game I told you I was going boots
[07:20:16.200 --> 07:20:18.200]  I went boots for the uh
[07:20:18.520 --> 07:20:22.600]  You know the fast boot to rush for thresh. I don't need that this game because
[07:20:23.720 --> 07:20:25.720]  We just went through like faster mythic
[07:20:30.040 --> 07:20:32.920]  So I should have gone free boots for like more efficiency
[07:20:34.120 --> 07:20:36.120]  I
[07:20:40.280 --> 07:20:46.440]  Can't understand and I could just kill a man you can't understand
[07:20:47.000 --> 07:20:49.000]  I could just kill a man
[07:21:03.880 --> 07:21:12.760]  I want to push this wave so we don't get like shit on
[07:21:33.880 --> 07:21:35.880]  I
[07:21:40.520 --> 07:21:46.920]  Just kill a man and you can't understand just kill a man
[07:21:51.160 --> 07:21:57.080]  Kill a man there is something you can't understand kill a man
[07:22:03.880 --> 07:22:05.880]  I
[07:22:24.760 --> 07:22:28.760]  Could go back here, but I don't see any reason to go back yet
[07:22:33.880 --> 07:22:35.880]  I think I'm dead
[07:22:41.400 --> 07:22:43.400]  Oh
[07:22:44.440 --> 07:22:49.400]  I misplayed that that was actually really good by lila cool down. It's not you're fine, man
[07:22:49.960 --> 07:22:54.440]  I wish I could I wish I could tell him that he played it fine. I messed up not him. I messed up
[07:22:56.440 --> 07:22:59.160]  I I feel bad. I want to like say no you're fine
[07:23:03.880 --> 07:23:05.720]  Because that was my bad
[07:23:05.720 --> 07:23:11.000]  I should have okay, so when I flashed and I was running away from the twitch right the second that twitch flashed on me
[07:23:11.000 --> 07:23:13.000]  I should have instantly started autoing him
[07:23:13.480 --> 07:23:18.600]  Like I it was one extra auto like one single extra auto and it would have been fine
[07:23:22.040 --> 07:23:24.040]  Why can't I tell her
[07:23:26.200 --> 07:23:29.720]  You know, I just choose not to type anymore it's my choice
[07:23:30.680 --> 07:23:32.680]  You know
[07:23:35.720 --> 07:23:37.720]  Yeah
[07:23:40.200 --> 07:23:42.200]  My choice
[07:23:59.720 --> 07:24:01.720]  That guy's actually doing that, huh?
[07:24:04.600 --> 07:24:09.720]  We win to be too really fucking hard especially with tier two boots, but I need a
[07:24:25.000 --> 07:24:28.200]  Dude, I'm doing some scripty shit. I don't be real
[07:24:30.440 --> 07:24:32.440]  I
[07:24:34.040 --> 07:24:38.600]  Dude Lulu wasn't six. I thought she was six. I'm so bad
[07:24:41.880 --> 07:24:45.240]  I wish I could tell her my bad again. I'm actually trolling
[07:24:46.440 --> 07:24:50.760]  like I ran out of mana because I'm bad and then I uh
[07:24:53.560 --> 07:24:55.320]  And then I thought she was six
[07:24:55.320 --> 07:24:59.320]  So I walked up to like take tank the turret for a second right because I was like, oh, shit
[07:24:59.320 --> 07:25:04.520]  Maybe I'll get like we move and kill this guy. Maybe Lulu has a spell or something. I just oh, I played bad my bad
[07:25:10.760 --> 07:25:13.000]  W that make sure anchor's not there
[07:25:18.280 --> 07:25:22.840]  I feel I actually just feel so bad because the Lulu is actually playing really this like the best support I've had all day
[07:25:23.720 --> 07:25:27.240]  Like this guy's actually impressing me, right? Like this guy's playing really well
[07:25:32.760 --> 07:25:34.760]  And I'm just griefing
[07:25:53.240 --> 07:25:55.240]  I
[07:26:00.760 --> 07:26:02.760]  Gave her life for me
[07:26:05.720 --> 07:26:07.720]  Lulu gave her life for me boys
[07:26:09.720 --> 07:26:14.440]  Can we get a salute for Lulu and chat boys? Can we get a salute?
[07:26:17.000 --> 07:26:19.000]  Can we get some love for Lulu?
[07:26:20.120 --> 07:26:22.120]  She gave her life
[07:26:23.080 --> 07:26:25.080]  I
[07:26:27.880 --> 07:26:29.880]  For the homie
[07:26:43.880 --> 07:26:46.840]  Honestly that was a really cool 2v2 by the way
[07:26:47.400 --> 07:26:52.680]  Oh, oh night was smurfing it. What the fuck? Yo kill that bitch, too
[07:27:09.720 --> 07:27:11.720]  Nice
[07:27:16.840 --> 07:27:18.840]  Oh
[07:27:23.240 --> 07:27:26.840]  If I lost that cannon I would have lost my life in game
[07:27:46.840 --> 07:27:48.840]  I
[07:27:56.840 --> 07:28:01.640]  I'm gonna go BT second item we have Lulu. Uh, so wait, what the fuck is this pathing?
[07:28:03.320 --> 07:28:06.360]  I clicked to go bot and it passed me in the weirdest spot ever we have Lulu
[07:28:06.680 --> 07:28:11.480]  So I could actually go ie second, but I think if I go BT I'll be actually unkillable
[07:28:12.920 --> 07:28:14.920]  Like it'll be the greatest thing ever
[07:28:17.080 --> 07:28:22.200]  I actually still might go ie as I'm thinking about it that loud by saying we have Lulu and not be stupid, but hey
[07:28:23.000 --> 07:28:29.160]  I still might you know, I still might go ie, but I don't know yet. We'll see because I took a lack already. So it's like
[07:28:32.600 --> 07:28:34.600]  Wow
[07:28:34.600 --> 07:28:37.160]  I
[07:29:05.560 --> 07:29:07.560]  I
[07:29:09.400 --> 07:29:11.400]  Mean I don't know why I flashed away
[07:29:13.320 --> 07:29:15.640]  I'm playing bad. It's my fault
[07:29:17.320 --> 07:29:21.720]  I think the game's over. So I'm just I'm playing bad. I'm like limit testing a little bit too much
[07:29:21.720 --> 07:29:23.720]  She
[07:29:32.680 --> 07:29:34.680]  Today
[07:29:51.720 --> 07:29:54.680]  He
[07:30:21.720 --> 07:30:24.440]  I
[07:30:52.040 --> 07:30:54.040]  I
[07:30:55.640 --> 07:30:58.200]  Surprised they haven't for put it though. What the fuck dude?
[07:30:59.080 --> 07:31:03.080]  How does this game? Oh, I'm even more mad. You guys have no idea
[07:31:04.440 --> 07:31:06.440]  so I
[07:31:07.000 --> 07:31:10.360]  It's 24 to 8 the enemy team doesn't forfeit
[07:31:11.080 --> 07:31:13.960]  But my team forfeits when the score is 10 to 14
[07:31:15.640 --> 07:31:17.640]  And we're only down a thousand golds
[07:31:22.680 --> 07:31:24.680]  So
[07:31:35.640 --> 07:31:39.320]  Sorry, I was that was my bad. I was tilted by uh
[07:31:41.800 --> 07:31:45.560]  You know, I was thinking about about how they weren't forfeiting and I was getting mad
[07:31:47.320 --> 07:31:49.720]  It is a little interesting because like I said, they still can't win
[07:31:50.360 --> 07:31:55.160]  So I don't know who the fuck's heading no, but it's probably echo. Well, no echo is definitely heading no, but like who else
[07:31:57.160 --> 07:31:59.160]  Maybe brand
[07:32:01.400 --> 07:32:03.560]  Maybe ribbon maybe ribbon's like, yeah
[07:32:07.480 --> 07:32:09.480]  They did just get a thousand gold
[07:32:12.440 --> 07:32:14.440]  All right, I should probably stop trolling
[07:32:14.600 --> 07:32:16.600]  I
[07:32:17.160 --> 07:32:19.160]  Feel pretty silly if we lost because I'm bad
[07:32:19.880 --> 07:32:24.200]  After we like dumpster them and laying that hard. I feel pretty silly if we lost because I keep getting caught
[07:32:41.800 --> 07:32:43.800]  All right, I should be unkillable now
[07:32:45.400 --> 07:32:47.880]  Like I'm not even farming I'm actually griefing
[07:32:48.840 --> 07:32:50.840]  I should probably go make dinner after this game
[07:32:51.160 --> 07:32:55.400]  I want to keep playing because I'm playing well today, but like dude my brain is starting to go like
[07:32:56.120 --> 07:32:58.120]  Like I probably need to go make some food
[07:32:58.360 --> 07:33:00.840]  I'm getting the full ADHD brain experience going
[07:33:00.840 --> 07:33:16.120]  So let's see if I can muster all my focus
[07:33:20.680 --> 07:33:25.560]  Let's see if I can muster up all my focus really quick just for push out and finish this game
[07:33:26.280 --> 07:33:35.160]  We'll go terminator mode for the the end of this game right now. We'll muster up all of the all of the focus
[07:33:44.200 --> 07:33:47.320]  Demon mode engaged boys god that sounded really cringe
[07:33:55.560 --> 07:33:57.560]  You
[07:34:26.040 --> 07:34:40.520]  I'm actually really impressed though night blue played this game really really well
[07:34:42.600 --> 07:34:47.960]  Like I'll be honest my last like thought of night blue was him being bad at league
[07:34:49.480 --> 07:34:51.640]  He played this game really well
[07:34:52.600 --> 07:34:53.880]  my
[07:34:54.880 --> 07:34:56.880]  men's gotten so much better
[07:35:02.900 --> 07:35:07.860]  Okay, nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that
[07:35:07.860 --> 07:35:13.080]  Nobody saw that nobody saw that nobody saw that not one of you saw me flash after the echo
[07:35:13.080 --> 07:35:14.680]  Old is not one of you
[07:35:14.680 --> 07:35:16.680]  You
[07:35:21.640 --> 07:35:29.340]  Wasted flash now that was assertive flash an assertive dominant flash not wasted at all
[07:35:35.440 --> 07:35:42.220]  They might actually go for Baron here we should look for this like they could try oh he's here
[07:35:44.680 --> 07:35:51.120]  Pretty sure the ribbons here too though
[07:35:52.800 --> 07:35:59.120]  Yep, I did not mean to do that. I didn't mean to hit the thing. I accidentally hit the blast plants
[07:36:00.480 --> 07:36:03.520]  That was that was an accident. It was a it was a literal pure accident
[07:36:06.360 --> 07:36:08.240]  Like I I
[07:36:08.240 --> 07:36:11.500]  Did not mean to hit it. I was like I know ribbons here
[07:36:11.500 --> 07:36:16.980]  I'm gonna wait for Yasuo before I go over or before I do this right and I'm gonna bait him and I just completely
[07:36:17.100 --> 07:36:23.340]  Whiffed every like I'm bad. We'll leave it at I'm bad. That's a good way to put I'm bad. I'm hungry. I'm old

[07:36:26.860 --> 07:36:28.860]  Short to short mad
[07:36:42.500 --> 07:36:45.100]  Yeah, that was a pedestrian flash
[07:36:46.340 --> 07:36:52.120]  It is she as well. Oh, yeah, it's it's a plethora a plethora of terrible things I
[07:36:56.420 --> 07:36:58.420]  Still got to go to the gym tonight, too
[07:37:11.500 --> 07:37:13.500]  It's
[07:37:22.780 --> 07:37:31.380]  Ed's bot okay, I'm a little nervous of like getting flanks right their junglers could just like sit in places
[07:37:42.500 --> 07:37:44.500]  I

[07:38:11.860 --> 07:38:13.860]  I
[07:38:18.180 --> 07:38:20.580]  I'm actually so sad I'm playing so bad
[07:38:21.900 --> 07:38:26.580]  Like I was playing so good at the start and now I'm playing so bad that actually makes me sad I
[07:38:36.060 --> 07:38:38.060]  Was tanking for that guy
[07:38:41.500 --> 07:38:43.500]  I
[07:38:49.340 --> 07:38:51.340]  Let's just leave I
[07:38:58.780 --> 07:39:04.540]  Don't want to I don't want to throw the game for my my teammates because like I'm getting like, you know
[07:39:06.980 --> 07:39:09.420]  I've already died five times like a dipshit
[07:39:11.500 --> 07:39:13.500]  Oh
[07:39:34.740 --> 07:39:36.740]  Where'd he go
[07:39:41.500 --> 07:39:45.980]  We should just push bot honestly, we don't even need this dragon
[07:39:56.100 --> 07:39:58.100]  Okay, we just I'm just gonna push bot
[07:40:11.500 --> 07:40:13.500]  I
[07:40:41.660 --> 07:40:43.660]  I
[07:40:43.980 --> 07:40:45.980]  Not bad
[07:40:58.660 --> 07:41:03.300]  Not bad at all I got to give it to I want to give it to night blue, but I got to give it to this Lulu
[07:41:04.340 --> 07:41:06.580]  Lulu played that game so good. I
[07:41:06.700 --> 07:41:11.300]  Got to give it to Lulu. She played so fucking good
[07:41:16.020 --> 07:41:18.020]  Like actually
[07:41:32.140 --> 07:41:34.140]  I don't even know if she's still in here
[07:41:36.580 --> 07:41:38.580]  I
[07:41:52.740 --> 07:41:54.740]  Not a script there
[07:42:01.940 --> 07:42:03.940]  She thinks I'm a sk- no I'm serious
[07:42:06.580 --> 07:42:14.220]  She thinks I'm a scripter
[07:42:19.180 --> 07:42:21.180]  Bro, I'm streaming
[07:42:37.580 --> 07:42:39.580]  I
[07:42:43.420 --> 07:42:46.700]  Don't I'll take it my ego feels good
[07:42:56.100 --> 07:42:59.340]  Honestly that feels good that feels good hi, well
[07:43:00.220 --> 07:43:02.220]  I
[07:43:03.940 --> 07:43:06.060]  Was a script dude, I'm not gonna lie though
[07:43:06.220 --> 07:43:14.300]  Some of those movements were sus as fuck that I was making like I was I like I like turned on the fucking mental scripts for that game
[07:43:14.660 --> 07:43:16.980]  Some of those movements early were nuts
[07:43:19.620 --> 07:43:21.900]  Like like just like this tiny little
[07:43:22.540 --> 07:43:26.020]  Tiny little movements I was doing early game and lame were crazy
[07:43:26.380 --> 07:43:30.140]  Like look at this watch this like this movement right here right like look I
[07:43:35.620 --> 07:43:40.940]  Dodge that right then I walk up cleanse the thing kite down
[07:43:46.300 --> 07:43:49.820]  Like that that movement is gross man look
[07:43:49.820 --> 07:44:01.220]  That was actually some gross ass movement, I'm not gonna lie. We this in the corner man in the corner
[07:44:03.180 --> 07:44:05.180]  My brain was like
[07:44:08.460 --> 07:44:12.580]  Yo Andromeda, thank you man. Yo you played really good now. I felt bad
[07:44:12.580 --> 07:44:16.380]  I felt so bad because I was grieving like I was
[07:44:16.940 --> 07:44:21.700]  Like at the start of the game we were just snow like I literally fucked up like three times
[07:44:22.500 --> 07:44:25.100]  During like the really important fights and I was like, oh no
[07:44:30.060 --> 07:44:33.580]  Yeah, maybe the beds can I play Calista I can
[07:44:37.820 --> 07:44:42.020]  I'm trying to figure out if I want to play a Calista game or if I want to go make dinner
[07:44:46.500 --> 07:44:54.260]  There was one other movement that I thought was kind of nuts I did a really good movement to somewhere
[07:44:54.260 --> 07:44:56.260]  I don't remember what it was
[07:44:58.300 --> 07:45:01.140]  Here's where I fucked up so right now I
[07:45:01.620 --> 07:45:07.060]  Should have just been I for some reason my brain lagged and I should have just been sitting here um I
[07:45:07.780 --> 07:45:10.300]  Should have just cleansed and then started fighting the twitch
[07:45:11.140 --> 07:45:16.460]  For some reason I didn't cleanse but this wasn't like your fault at all like I the second the twitch flashed
[07:45:16.460 --> 07:45:20.020]  I should have insta cleansed the ignite and I should have just been killing him
[07:45:20.460 --> 07:45:25.060]  Like right now just like autoing because I can't get away from him right but it took me an extra second
[07:45:25.060 --> 07:45:27.060]  See how I I started fighting him now
[07:45:29.580 --> 07:45:36.180]  Like I barely died I wouldn't have died had I cleansed and had I just turned initially it was fine
[07:45:41.300 --> 07:45:46.020]  And then like here I fucked up too because I went in and I thought we were six
[07:45:54.220 --> 07:45:56.220]  Oh, I could have killed that guy I
[07:45:57.060 --> 07:46:00.780]  Should have gone forward one more. Oh, you know what I should have done there
[07:46:00.780 --> 07:46:03.420]  I should have gone forward one more auto killed this guy
[07:46:03.700 --> 07:46:05.820]  Lulu would have gotten six off of the kill
[07:46:05.820 --> 07:46:10.500]  I would have used my speed to come back out then she could have altered me we could have killed the
[07:46:11.540 --> 07:46:14.540]  We could have got the twitch and then we could have turned on this echo too. Oh
[07:46:21.820 --> 07:46:27.380]  This was a really cool 2v2 I actually thought this 2v2 was really sick
[07:46:27.700 --> 07:46:29.700]  I
[07:46:32.500 --> 07:46:39.580]  Lulu is a real one for this man. Listen, you're a real one for this one. You just took the death to save me
[07:46:44.660 --> 07:46:47.380]  Respect your real one for that
[07:46:52.620 --> 07:46:54.620]  That is so good
[07:46:58.220 --> 07:47:02.500]  Jesus was fun. Yeah, geez you were the best support I've had today
[07:47:02.940 --> 07:47:08.380]  Like legitimately you played better than all the other players in the sealer. That was really good. Like I was surprised
[07:47:08.380 --> 07:47:15.140]  I was telling my stream. I was like, yeah, this she's actually like they I said she's here. I don't know, you know, but I was like, yeah
[07:47:16.020 --> 07:47:19.500]  She's playing super good. She's playing way better than all of my fucking teammates
[07:47:19.500 --> 07:47:21.500]  Yo
[07:47:26.060 --> 07:47:28.060]  What time is it it's six
[07:47:28.380 --> 07:47:34.100]  Man, do I want to do I want to keep streaming or do I want to go to or do I want to go get food and go to the gym?
[07:47:36.140 --> 07:47:42.340]  I can't like 24 hour fitness is not actually 24 anymore, so I'd have to go soon if I'm gonna go to the gym
[07:47:46.540 --> 07:47:48.540]  But it is only like six
[07:47:49.500 --> 07:47:51.500]  I
[07:47:57.940 --> 07:47:59.940]  Hmm
[07:48:00.900 --> 07:48:03.220]  But I could just end on I
[07:48:04.180 --> 07:48:08.420]  Could just end on the hitting the like 400 LP mark and just chill for now
[07:48:11.180 --> 07:48:13.980]  Right like we had 400 LP we'll probably hit GM tomorrow
[07:48:15.660 --> 07:48:18.420]  So I could just chill for now and then we just hit GM tomorrow
[07:48:19.940 --> 07:48:21.940]  That's
[07:48:22.020 --> 07:48:28.020]  Probably a better idea because then I won't get mad like say say we get like like say we get another game like this, right?
[07:48:29.340 --> 07:48:34.340]  Like say we get another game like this where like we're literally winning the game and my team's like no
[07:48:34.340 --> 07:48:37.940]  Let's forfeit like that's gonna make me mad. I was mad. This is gonna make me mad, right?
[07:48:37.940 --> 07:48:43.220]  Like I so I'd rather just like get off on a good note like a happy note. You know like not be tilted
[07:48:49.620 --> 07:48:55.380]  GM tomorrow, yeah, I hope so. I've been I think I can get challenger back this year, but we got to get to GM first
[07:48:55.980 --> 07:49:00.860]  I'm telling you I this elo is so miserable like master tier is
[07:49:01.540 --> 07:49:08.160]  The worst elo I've ever played in in my 12 years of playing this game
[07:49:09.340 --> 07:49:13.300]  Whatever and a 300 400 LP masters is is
[07:49:14.380 --> 07:49:15.540]  literally
[07:49:15.540 --> 07:49:23.140]  Disgusting these these are not real people like I feel like half these games we are playing with NPCs
[07:49:24.700 --> 07:49:29.900]  Who quite literally don't even like I don't even know what to say other bots and
[07:49:30.500 --> 07:49:35.340]  They can't be real humans. They get mad over nothing. They rage quit over nothing
[07:49:35.340 --> 07:49:40.900]  They they they give up at 15 minutes when we're winning the game. These cannot be real people
[07:49:41.420 --> 07:49:43.420]  So I
[07:49:43.820 --> 07:49:51.700]  Swear to God the game has to get better in GM. It has to get better. There's no world that it gets worse
[07:49:52.860 --> 07:49:54.860]  Like I refuse to believe that
[07:49:55.780 --> 07:49:58.460]  Because this is this is the worst grind I've ever had
[07:50:02.460 --> 07:50:04.460]  Is it bad to be a bot
[07:50:06.340 --> 07:50:08.340]  Are you saying I'm boddest
[07:50:09.340 --> 07:50:10.020]  I
[07:50:10.020 --> 07:50:16.580]  Really cancel me because I because I because I don't like bots. I said it. I'm saying it. I don't like fucking bots. Whoa
[07:50:17.300 --> 07:50:21.780]  Okay, I didn't need to add fuck it. You know what? We're just gonna get off. I'm gonna. Yeah, that's it. That's it for me
[07:50:22.860 --> 07:50:24.860]  I'm gonna get off voice. I'm tired
[07:50:24.860 --> 07:50:28.620]  I need to go to the gym before I run out of juice make some dinner
[07:50:28.620 --> 07:50:34.420]  I will be live tomorrow same time as today. I've been starting my stream at 10 a.m. My time
[07:50:35.420 --> 07:50:40.900]  Maybe I'll do it tomorrow at 9 a.m. I don't know it's 10 or 9 1 between there
[07:50:40.900 --> 07:50:42.900]  I always start my stream and so
[07:50:43.420 --> 07:50:47.060]  And that's my time so it's like 7 8 9 PST
[07:50:47.820 --> 07:50:51.620]  You're good at 80. Thanks, man. I think I suck my goal is
[07:50:52.620 --> 07:50:54.620]  Hopefully I can get challenger back and
[07:50:55.180 --> 07:51:01.060]  Then I'm not gonna play like I just want to my goal is challenger so that I can prove to myself
[07:51:02.060 --> 07:51:04.060]  It's a really stupid thing
[07:51:04.060 --> 07:51:06.820]  But I want to prove to myself that I can still do it at 32
[07:51:07.260 --> 07:51:10.300]  Because 10 years ago was the first time I started streaming this year
[07:51:10.300 --> 07:51:13.980]  I've been streaming for 10 years this year and so I want to get challenger
[07:51:15.060 --> 07:51:19.060]  Because when I first started streaming I was in challenger and I want to see if like after 10 years
[07:51:19.060 --> 07:51:21.060]  I can still do it and
[07:51:21.940 --> 07:51:23.940]  Then I'm never gonna care again
[07:51:24.380 --> 07:51:27.180]  This will be the only time I ever give a shit about getting challenger
[07:51:27.180 --> 07:51:30.700]  I just want to get it see if I care and then play for content, you know
[07:51:32.060 --> 07:51:36.540]  But uh, yeah, it's just it's like welcome to the league of Draven
[07:51:37.340 --> 07:51:40.740]  See if the old man who has fucking arthritis and
[07:51:41.500 --> 07:51:45.060]  Fucking carpal tunnel and all that shit, you know what I mean? See if I can still do it
[07:51:46.740 --> 07:51:49.780]  Yo, thank you for the twitch prime man, I appreciate it. Thank you so much
[07:51:50.380 --> 07:51:51.700]  Appreciate it a lot dude
[07:51:51.700 --> 07:51:53.380]  All right guys, that's gonna be it for me
[07:51:53.380 --> 07:51:58.740]  If you like to stream don't forget to follow all my socials and tiktok and Facebook and Instagram and all that shits all the clickable
[07:51:58.740 --> 07:52:00.780]  Garbage is underneath the stream. Don't forget to check it out
[07:52:02.060 --> 07:52:04.220]  I'll be back tomorrow same time in the morning
[07:52:05.020 --> 07:52:08.980]  I tomorrow's my last day for the weekend though. I'm not gonna stream on Saturday
[07:52:08.980 --> 07:52:11.860]  I might do some off off stream grinding on Saturday
[07:52:12.020 --> 07:52:15.300]  I've been taking I've been like forcing myself to take a day off of streaming
[07:52:15.780 --> 07:52:21.380]  Every week just so like I can mentally recharge and I think it's actually been really good for my stream
[07:52:21.780 --> 07:52:25.740]  Because like I've been in a much better mood while streaming and I've been much less tilted and I've been
[07:52:26.700 --> 07:52:30.940]  Even if I play league off stream or whatever it's just like it doesn't feel as forced
[07:52:30.940 --> 07:52:35.880]  So I feel like the brakes nice. So yeah tomorrow no stream on Saturday tomorrow for sure and Sunday
[07:52:35.880 --> 07:52:41.140]  I might I might do a short stream, but yeah, I'll see you guys then. Thanks for watching. I appreciate it guys
[07:52:43.300 --> 07:52:46.220]  And yeah, that's it I'm gonna go make dinner
[07:52:48.340 --> 07:52:50.740]  Oh, we guys have a good night day wherever the fuck you are
[07:52:51.340 --> 07:52:55.420]  Later dudes, but we guys have a good one. It was fun playing with it in drama
[07:52:55.740 --> 07:52:58.820]  Go out on the games. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Peace
