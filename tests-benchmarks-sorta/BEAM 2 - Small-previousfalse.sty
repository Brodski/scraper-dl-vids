[8546.00s -> 8548.00s]  5
[8548.00s -> 8555.84s]  right? This person doesn't ever take risks, doesn't ever do anything to try and win the game outside
[8555.84s -> 8563.12s]  of like just like existing and hitting buttons. And what they do is they will always have good
[8563.12s -> 8568.88s]  KDAs and they will they will sit here and never like I know why they're losing. They will sit
[8568.88s -> 8572.72s]  here and they will do this shit where they have good KDAs they they don't ever die that much
[8572.72s -> 8578.56s]  blah blah blah. But what they do is they lie to themselves and they say look how good my KDAs are.
[8579.36s -> 8581.44s]  If I had better teammates I'd always win.
[8584.88s -> 8592.08s]  Like I cracked the code actually. That's totally what it is. The players actually like
[8592.72s -> 8598.64s]  play so safe and they play to like for statistics right. They play like purely for the stats
[8598.64s -> 8604.48s]  And then they can say that it was their team's fault that they didn't win because they played
[8605.20s -> 8607.28s]  Really bad, but they didn't die
[8612.24s -> 8616.84s]  Because I mean in theory I could have a perfect KDA on every 80 carry I play
[8617.36s -> 8623.64s]  Right all I'd have to do is literally walk walk up get one kill and then AFK and stand in the base the rest of the game
[8625.24s -> 8628.12s]  And I could be like yo, why is my team not able to carry what's happening?
[8628.64s -> 8633.64s]  But you could literally do that.
[8633.64s -> 8636.64s]  No, I seriously think the person is self-gaslighting himself.
[8636.64s -> 8638.64s]  Like, I'm serious.
[8638.64s -> 8641.64s]  I think this person is self-gaslighting where they're like,
[8641.64s -> 8643.64s]  oh, it's my team's fault every game.
[8643.64s -> 8646.64s]  Like, they're always blaming their team for their loses
[8646.64s -> 8648.64s]  and their mistakes and shits.
[8648.64s -> 8651.64s]  And it's sad because there's a reason you're D2.
[8651.64s -> 8653.64s]  And I'm not saying that to be toxic.
[8653.64s -> 8655.64s]  I'm saying that you haven't improved in four years.
[8655.64s -> 8657.64s]  And you haven't improved because all you're doing
[8657.64s -> 8661.80s]  playing to blame your team every single game when I just saw like 500 mistakes
[8661.80s -> 8672.24s]  that you made that we could have won the game off of early game here I remember
[8672.24s -> 8676.56s]  somebody wanted me to play a Caitlyn game last game so we're gonna play Kate I
[8676.56s -> 8680.28s]  don't remember I don't remember who it was in the chat somebody's like two
[8680.28s -> 8684.92s]  people said Kate but we'll do a cake game for you guys I got your voice
[8684.92s -> 8686.92s]  Don't worry
[8702.84s -> 8704.68s]  All right, I'm gonna take
[8704.68s -> 8710.36s]  Ghost flash because they have three melee champs four melee champs. They've they have for conzed clad cragas
[8710.36s -> 8712.36s]  So I'm gonna take a ghost flash
[8712.36s -> 8716.50s]  These are going to be my runes this game, I'm going to take a little more MR because
[8716.50s -> 8719.50s]  I don't think we're going to be fighting too much in lane, we're pretty much just going
[8719.50s -> 8723.82s]  to be poking them with Karma Kate, so I'm going to take a little bit of extra MR because
[8723.82s -> 8728.02s]  I'm going to be playing for mid delay game, I'm just scaling.
[8728.02s -> 8737.50s]  And these are going to be the runes that I take.
[8737.50s -> 8743.14s]  class on adc or the easier to play ones in adc I usually do like when I'm
[8743.14s -> 8746.74s]  playing on this account right now this is like my teaching account it's a little
[8746.74s -> 8752.68s]  lower mmr right it's like d1 low masters I usually play adc that like
[8752.68s -> 8755.98s]  the chat wants to see me play so that you guys can learn like good and bad
[8755.98s -> 8761.34s]  matchups and things like that's the last two games I got way too tilted by
[8761.34s -> 8765.82s]  shitty support players like egos and all that shit I got way too frustrated
[8765.82s -> 8768.22s]  I played bad the last two games. So we're gonna
[8769.14s -> 8771.64s]  Honestly, I'm just gonna I think I'm just gonna mute these people at the very start of the game
[8772.50s -> 8777.34s]  Normally, I wouldn't suggest you meet people because like playing as a team is really important
[8778.54s -> 8782.14s]  Because like, you know, you need to communicate and all that shit, but I am just like I'm gonna mute them
[8783.74s -> 8785.74s]  Cuz I
[8785.78s -> 8789.86s]  Dude my mental is taking a fucking hit right now. So we're gonna just chill and play I
[8793.62s -> 8795.62s]  Just don't know how to play now
[8795.82s -> 8798.54s]  I think Nyla's really good. I just don't know how to play her.
[8800.14s -> 8801.34s]  I think she's a great champ.
[8804.26s -> 8806.66s]  Like, I've been getting shit on by Nyla on my main account.
[8808.06s -> 8810.42s]  Like, a lot of Grandmaster Nyla's have been dumpstering me.
[8820.10s -> 8822.82s]  I think she's just really good at abusing solo queue.
[8823.86s -> 8825.26s]  Like, the issue with Nyla...
[8825.82s -> 8829.42s]  is from what I've seen all the losses I've had with Nyla.
[8829.42s -> 8833.12s]  People don't, it's like the thing I was telling you about before.
[8833.12s -> 8836.52s]  People don't play aggressively in the lower Elos,
[8836.52s -> 8837.88s]  like even in Grandmaster,
[8837.88s -> 8839.52s]  people don't play aggressively enough.
[8839.52s -> 8841.72s]  It sounds crazy to say that, but it's true.
[8841.72s -> 8843.22s]  They don't play aggressively enough in lane,
[8843.22s -> 8846.52s]  so you can get away with just picking Nyla and scaling.
[8846.52s -> 8849.72s]  And Nyla at one item, you'll always be up in levels, right?
[8849.72s -> 8852.52s]  Because that's how the champion works.
[8852.52s -> 8854.62s]  The champion works and you'll always be up in levels
[8854.62s -> 8861.58s]  because of her passive so you basically just like scale through existing it's
[8861.58s -> 8869.46s]  pretty it's pretty interesting all right so we're playing cake karma oh I missed
[8869.46s -> 8875.42s]  the minion because I suck I'm gonna ward this bush just because I don't
[8875.42s -> 8878.50s]  want the recon in the bush
[8878.50s -> 8887.86s]  So now that the bush isn't warded anymore, um, okay, he warded nice.
[8887.86s -> 8893.56s]  I was gonna say what I want to do is I actually want to play, aww I suck.
[8893.56s -> 8897.32s]  I actually wanted to play, oh man, I'm so bad at Cait, I wanted to play on the top
[8897.32s -> 8901.42s]  side of the wave so that I'm not standing near the bushes, right?
[8901.42s -> 8905.70s]  Because if you stand near the bushes, the Rakan can obviously like W me and I just
[8905.70s -> 8906.70s]  get fucked.
[8906.70s -> 8908.70s]  I'd rather play in a safer spot
[8909.50s -> 8911.50s]  Can't believe I missed 2 CS. I'm so fucking bad
[8912.34s -> 8916.62s]  Now I want to push in wave 3 and I want to go buy a call. So I'm gonna ping to push
[8925.38s -> 8927.02s]  Okay
[8927.02s -> 8931.80s]  So I actually want to back here and I'm gonna go buy a call. So this is called a cheater recall
[8931.80s -> 8937.08s]  You usually have perfect CS the back on this timer
[8937.82s -> 8939.82s]  Go and you can go by a call. Okay
[8940.32s -> 8944.32s]  This is like something that you can do if you're in a lane that's going to be perma shoving
[8944.48s -> 8951.30s]  So what happens is the reason it's called the cheetah recall is because we push the wave in they had to stay and form the wave
[8951.60s -> 8953.60s]  Right now watch
[8956.04s -> 8961.40s]  They have to push this wave in right now if karma was here instead of roaming this room is fine by the way
[8961.40s -> 8964.08s]  But if she was here instead of roaming she could actually hold the wave
[8965.20s -> 8970.26s]  And if you notice here, I don't actually miss that many minions, right? We're chillin
[8974.60s -> 8978.96s]  Now we can slow push this we're safe I should actually fast push this
[8979.84s -> 8987.88s]  Because I wanted to bounce I don't want to so push this but I can't I can't fast push this at level 3 by myself
[8992.36s -> 8994.36s]  So we're just gonna chill
[8994.72s -> 9000.60s]  Kaelin's really good at abusing like early lane phase bullying just based on like what our kit does
[9000.92s -> 9003.48s]  We see recon on the map top side you get you see that's
[9004.48s -> 9006.48s]  So because we see we're con I
[9007.96s -> 9011.16s]  Can walk up a bit and we could play a little aggro here
[9011.16s -> 9022.46s]  You can kind of see like I don't have to play behind the minion wave you see what I'm doing to this guy, right I
[9023.50s -> 9026.54s]  Hate this game we can quit we can we can forfeit. It's fun. I
[9029.58s -> 9031.58s]  Hate this game
[9032.58s -> 9037.76s]  I really hate this game dude. What is wrong with me right now? It's like my brain doesn't work
[9037.76s -> 9042.46s]  It's the 280 K nerf telling you
[9047.22s -> 9049.36s]  So we're cons gonna be bought right now I
[9050.80s -> 9056.30s]  Know he's gonna be bought so I need to be a little care now my karma is here
[9058.98s -> 9062.38s]  There we go, so you notice I didn't use any spells I'm not I'm just chilling
[9062.38s -> 9071.06s]  Dude, are you kidding me, man?
[9071.06s -> 9075.22s]  I'm gonna be honest, I'm getting really tilted by these players now.
[9075.22s -> 9081.02s]  Like the Recon W's in, they just stand there and watch me die.
[9081.02s -> 9082.82s]  Okay, it's fine.
[9082.82s -> 9084.30s]  Listen, I'm not gonna get too mad about it.
[9084.30s -> 9085.30s]  It's fine.
[9085.30s -> 9086.98s]  I should have flashed the knockup, I guess.
[9086.98s -> 9089.90s]  Even though in reality, I should never have to flash the knockup.
[9089.90s -> 9095.74s]  I should have flashed it because I can't trust the teammates. So what I'm saying is right there karma and fiddle were both right here
[9095.74s -> 9101.50s]  I was being chased down they stood here. They didn't they didn't walk up to do anything. They just stood and waited
[9102.62s -> 9105.26s]  That pisses me off because I hate when players
[9106.38s -> 9108.38s]  play
[9108.38s -> 9110.88s]  Selfish and scared. It's my biggest pet peeve
[9113.58s -> 9115.58s]  It drives me fucking crazy man
[9116.66s -> 9118.66s]  Sorry, I'm getting I'm losing my mind
[9119.90s -> 9129.70s]  Like it's so easy it's fine though. I shouldn't have walked up an ego did it's on man
[9140.54s -> 9142.54s]  Yeah, I want to so push this wave
[9142.54s -> 9144.54s]  Stay out of my way
[9148.54s -> 9150.54s]  Yeah, I'm losing it
[9154.30s -> 9157.92s]  This by the way would be an example of a bad time for karma to run she needs to come back bot
[9161.92s -> 9164.12s]  There's absolutely no reason for it to roam on that timer
[9165.02s -> 9167.10s]  There's also no reason for it to be in that bush over there
[9167.10s -> 9169.78s]  We should be playing up to try we're playing cake karma, right?
[9169.78s -> 9172.72s]  We should be playing forward so that we can actually be aggressive
[9173.68s -> 9175.10s]  K karma's a lane bully lane
[9175.10s -> 9179.22s]  We don't want to sit here and just do nothing if you pick karma you want to be aggressive
[9179.22s -> 9182.98s]  You want to be playing up you want to be stunning you want to be doing like aggressive things playing the game
[9186.22s -> 9189.02s]  We're level six I'd really like to like go in yeah like
[9189.02s -> 9201.30s]  That was actually not bad by the karma. She w'd the Zyah and then I got to trap off of
[9201.30s -> 9225.90s]  it so that wasn't too bad. Not the worst. Not bad. That was good, that was good. Really
[9225.90s -> 9229.02s]  nice really nice okay so I'm gonna back here cuz I don't want to overstay for the wave
[9243.02s -> 9243.82s]  I'm gonna grab boots
[9247.90s -> 9252.78s]  you know what I think a lot of it is too I think a lot of it is people get really scared when
[9252.78s -> 9254.98s]  Like, Rakan is really strong in this meta, right?
[9254.98s -> 9256.38s]  Like, he's very, very powerful.
[9256.38s -> 9258.58s]  His numbers are a little too high right now,
[9258.58s -> 9261.08s]  so everything he does is just a little too good.
[9261.08s -> 9262.74s]  So I think people get nervous around Rakan,
[9262.74s -> 9263.86s]  especially with Zyah,
[9263.86s -> 9265.46s]  because it's like when people would get nervous
[9265.46s -> 9266.66s]  around non-milution.
[9266.66s -> 9268.54s]  The lane plays itself, it's very strong,
[9268.54s -> 9269.86s]  it's very hard to beat,
[9269.86s -> 9271.74s]  but you can still see people making mistakes
[9271.74s -> 9272.58s]  when they play the lane,
[9272.58s -> 9274.58s]  so you gotta watch for that type of stuff.
[9280.34s -> 9282.70s]  Now, a good way to play against a Zyah
[9282.70s -> 9293.30s]  once you hit six is you don't want to you don't want to ever walk melee range of
[9293.30s -> 9297.50s]  her or give her the ability to just kill you with the feathers your main goal
[9297.50s -> 9302.82s]  here is gonna be try and stay in a good spot when it comes to feathers like I
[9302.82s -> 9306.58s]  want to be to the side of her the side of her is the best option like where
[9306.58s -> 9309.82s]  she can't pull in like I'll get hit by maybe a few but she can't pull in
[9309.82s -> 9317.38s]  all of them. That's a really key thing when playing versus her. Because I remember back
[9317.38s -> 9320.74s]  in the day I didn't know how to play Versaia and I would always get fucking frustrated as
[9320.74s -> 9329.86s]  shit. So Rakan's 5. I want to hit Tab, see Rakan's 5. We shouldn't be able to die here.
[9329.86s -> 9333.82s]  I want to push this wave in, but I also need to stay away from where the Rakan could
[9333.82s -> 9340.82s]  be. So if you want to push waves in and reset the wave, make sure that you're
[9340.82s -> 9349.42s]  standing as far away as you can from where they can engage on you. Now they're
[9349.42s -> 9353.18s]  about to be six, Rakan is. So they have a really strong level six. She has pickaxe
[9353.18s -> 9356.42s]  and noon quiver. We do want to be a little hesitant here. We don't want to
[9356.42s -> 9362.74s]  fight. Now I'm gonna kind of push this in a bit. We should have been spam
[9362.74s -> 9366.78s]  pushing the whole wave because that's how k karma plays we just push push push
[9366.78s -> 9374.82s]  push but we played that that early roam by karma kind of put us behind on that
[9374.82s -> 9383.98s]  it's not a big deal it's just something that we have to adjust why does this say
[9383.98s -> 9390.74s]  88 and this say 90 which one is it
[9392.74s -> 9410.94s]  is it 88 or 90? I mean that guy is dead. I don't know what that
[9410.94s -> 9421.34s]  Karmus thinking but we probably have to give this Drake. I mean maybe we could fight it
[9421.34s -> 9424.86s]  Fiddle had ulti but him not having ult, yeah there's no way
[9431.02s -> 9433.98s]  The higher one counts ward kills why?
[9436.22s -> 9439.10s]  I think that's so stupid so they might try and engage here
[9441.02s -> 9446.14s]  Unless they somehow know fiddles in the bush, which would be impressive because we know it's not warded
[9448.38s -> 9450.38s]  So that'd be pretty impressive if they knew that
[9451.34s -> 9477.38s]  We could actually refs I'm just going to ghost.
[9477.38s -> 9478.66s]  This is crazy.
[9478.66s -> 9479.66s]  What the fuck?
[9479.66s -> 9481.66s]  Oh, this is interesting
[9485.86s -> 9490.18s]  They saw Fed 100% yeah, I don't know where though it must it because he used this thing
[9491.60s -> 9493.60s]  Little used his whatever it's called
[9495.54s -> 9498.22s]  His effigy I'd have to go look
[9502.26s -> 9504.26s]  One million. Oh, I guess I didn't see it
[9504.26s -> 9506.44s]  I
[9506.44s -> 9512.48s]  Should back I can get dove here. We don't know where Gragas is like if Gragas happens to be like he ease over this wall or something
[9512.48s -> 9515.98s]  I think it don't really easy. I'm greeting really hard
[9517.10s -> 9521.62s]  Greeting usually gets you killed typically I shouldn't be doing this
[9524.02s -> 9528.90s]  They're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right? It's like
[9529.82s -> 9532.66s]  If you know something it's gonna be a bad habit. You should not do it
[9535.24s -> 9537.24s]  Just cue the bush
[9537.92s -> 9540.20s]  Okay, that was I meant use like an actual cue
[9543.08s -> 9546.20s]  They could also be in the alcove so I'm a little hesitant, but it's fine
[9552.04s -> 9556.24s]  Okay, so the reason I stayed was because now I have my I have my mythic right
[9556.94s -> 9561.08s]  Because we we finished the coal and we finished the mythic at the same time or finished the wave so
[9561.08s -> 9570.38s]  Now I have two options. I go gale force here to dodge a lot of their shits or I can do what sounds like a fun option
[9571.76s -> 9573.76s]  We're gonna do shield bow
[9574.12s -> 9577.04s]  I'm gonna show you guys why I like shield bow on Caitlyn
[9577.92s -> 9579.92s]  It's not the best mythic
[9579.96s -> 9582.40s]  But it's good into certain comps
[9583.52s -> 9585.52s]  If you don't want to get
[9585.52s -> 9587.52s]  Yeah
[9587.52s -> 9589.52s]  Yeah
[9589.60s -> 9595.04s]  Because I have a lack ready this game. I don't have bloodline right so I kind of want to go shield bow
[9600.36s -> 9604.42s]  And then I'm gonna end up going either ie or I'm gonna end up going
[9607.84s -> 9613.50s]  Like bloodthirster seconds ie or BT probably ie just because
[9615.52s -> 9617.84s]  I think it's actually easier to go IE in this game.
[9624.76s -> 9626.70s]  But yeah, this is not a kind of boring game.
[9626.70s -> 9628.54s]  Our team's doing really well though, so we just chill.
[9637.16s -> 9639.26s]  We got to be a little care, okay.
[9645.52s -> 9659.64s]  It was kind of hard to do anything there even though I got like a few autos on the Gragas
[9659.64s -> 9662.12s]  It's a little difficult to actually play the game there
[9667.00s -> 9672.52s]  Because if I walk up too far like see we're cons there if I walk up too far I just get killed by Rakan
[9672.52s -> 9677.02s]  All right, I'm just gonna reset and go get boots
[9679.80s -> 9688.86s]  Typically any carry is really fucking boring in games like this where you can't really blow the game open
[9692.80s -> 9697.28s]  Oh, I'm dead maybe wait karma shield me I'm not dead
[9697.28s -> 9703.28s]  Nice. Fuck!
[9721.28s -> 9723.28s]  Motherfucker, co-read me, man.
[9723.28s -> 9725.28s]  Yours is like, co-read me.
[9725.28s -> 9728.24s]  We can fight this though they have no ults
[9734.20s -> 9738.08s]  Like this is actually fightable they have no Zyra R and no dragon star
[9741.56s -> 9746.08s]  And this is also why it's really important that you relate to your team the cooldowns of your team
[9747.00s -> 9749.76s]  Remember that don't forget that if somebody uses a big cooldown
[9749.88s -> 9753.20s]  Tell your team because that was an illegal dragon, right?
[9753.20s -> 9759.92s]  Like they just that was one of the most illegal things I've seen in the while homie completely griefed that
[9759.92s -> 9782.72s]  That's another very very very important thing that you need to take away from playing league
[9782.72s -> 9787.24s]  and being like this is what I was saying about team work and shit earlier being good at the
[9787.24s -> 9791.40s]  The game is a lot of spreading knowledge as well, right?
[9791.40s -> 9795.56s]  Like if your team doesn't know if a flash is up or down, you have to play completely
[9795.56s -> 9796.56s]  differently, right?
[9796.56s -> 9799.08s]  Like, you gotta think about the game and that in terms of that as well.
[9799.08s -> 9802.40s]  How many times have you seen, like, you know, you're like, oh, I can walk up here if
[9802.40s -> 9806.04s]  this guy can't flash ult me or something, right?
[9806.04s -> 9810.36s]  It happens all the time.
[9810.36s -> 9814.56s]  I wonder if I can kill a Duskblade Zed.
[9814.56s -> 9837.36s]  I don't know I probably could I should go mad what do you think about Timo and other top
[9837.36s -> 9844.70s]  when as ad carry I play Timo ad carry when I'm playing for fun sometimes it's
[9844.70s -> 9846.74s]  okay
[9853.34s -> 9859.20s]  yo go look on your game man so during the mid game is Caitlyn a few things that
[9859.20s -> 9862.66s]  I can kind of teach you this was kind of a boring lane phase right like we
[9862.66s -> 9866.70s]  didn't really do that much the lane phase was essentially just like we died
[9866.70s -> 9870.98s]  once and then you know everything all hell broke loose when you're walk up the
[9870.98s -> 9877.70s]  fights like this make sure that you're putting traps down in places where the
[9877.70s -> 9880.50s]  enemy has to walk
[9883.70s -> 9888.72s]  just like that playing 80 playing Caitlyn is not always about just like
[9888.72s -> 9892.74s]  auto-ing and getting cues and shits if you noticed during that fight I put two
[9892.74s -> 9897.70s]  traps here, two traps here. I forced the enemy team into like a location where they had to eat traps
[9900.26s -> 9904.18s]  or they uh they can't find us right and even if like
[9907.30s -> 9909.94s]  they avoid the traps they're still having to like move their character
[9910.58s -> 9914.34s]  in a very unique specific way that they probably don't want to do.
[9918.34s -> 9920.98s]  So you should always be thinking where should I put these traps down at the start of the
[9920.98s -> 9925.30s]  fight not like how do I get autos off think about using your traps to zone and
[9925.30s -> 9930.06s]  like control the team fight before the fight starts rather than using it to do
[9930.06s -> 9935.66s]  damage because they'll step in the traps themselves people will just people
[9935.66s -> 9941.06s]  are stupid they're bad people aren't paying attention everything I'm bad you
[9941.06s -> 9943.86s]  know I mean people can't pay attention to every bush that you're putting traps
[9943.86s -> 9949.82s]  in during a big fight it's it's too much attention span nobody has it
[9950.98s -> 9951.98s]  Nice.
[9951.98s -> 9966.26s]  I'm gonna go grab this red.
[9966.26s -> 9969.78s]  Oh, big tip for all the AD carries in chat.
[9969.78s -> 9975.86s]  Guys, I'm gonna tell you right now, once the 20 minute mark happens in League, your jungler's
[9975.86s -> 9978.26s]  camps are no longer his.
[9978.26s -> 9979.26s]  I know.
[9979.26s -> 9980.26s]  I know.
[9980.26s -> 9984.36s]  Listen, if you're a jungle player and you're like, fuck this guy now, I hate him, listen,
[9984.36s -> 9985.54s]  you know it's true.
[9985.54s -> 9991.14s]  You know, at 20 minutes, your camps no longer, like, they're not yours anymore, man, okay?
[9991.14s -> 9994.18s]  Like, you are full items at this point, okay?
[9994.18s -> 10000.44s]  Like, I want to be honest, you would, I'm taking your camps.
[10000.44s -> 10003.04s]  I'm trying to get my third item as fast as humanly possible.
[10010.64s -> 10014.24s]  Because AD carries spike on three items extremely hard.
[10021.14s -> 10023.84s]  And I want to walk top, but we have no vision of this area.
[10023.84s -> 10024.64s]  So it's a little scary.
[10024.64s -> 10034.80s]  Like I said, I typically don't like to take jungles camps early game, ever, because like
[10034.80s -> 10039.62s]  that's why I say like at 20 minutes, usually you have two items at this point.
[10039.62s -> 10042.70s]  If you're like farming decent and you know, etc.
[10042.70s -> 10045.16s]  Sometimes they'll be faster, but usually it's around average of like you'll have
[10045.16s -> 10049.12s]  your items at this point.
[10049.12s -> 10073.76s]  Always be tabbing to the teamfights even if you're farming as well.
[10073.76s -> 10076.64s]  That is in this bush.
[10076.64s -> 10080.44s]  Wait, where is he?
[10080.44s -> 10081.44s]  Wait, I'm stupid.
[10081.44s -> 10082.44s]  Where'd he go?
[10082.44s -> 10083.44s]  Oh, he died.
[10083.44s -> 10084.94s]  I killed him.
[10084.94s -> 10093.36s]  Wow, I'm really smart.
[10093.36s -> 10096.32s]  I didn't notice that I killed that guy.
[10096.32s -> 10099.32s]  I'm so dumb.
[10099.32s -> 10103.96s]  80 carry brain right boys. I
[10107.42s -> 10111.20s]  Was like playing that so scared too because I was like I was like easy there
[10121.02s -> 10123.02s]  Pull the dragon out
[10123.80s -> 10128.50s]  Why ask this yesterday, but what do you guys think the coolest looking dragon is I swear it's the
[10129.32s -> 10131.88s]  I think mountain drake looks fucking sick
[10159.32s -> 10161.32s]  I
[10173.40s -> 10176.40s]  That's mainly because we our karma just got picked off
[10177.80s -> 10183.60s]  And I don't want to give them the option of pushing the wave so by pushing the lane
[10189.32s -> 10208.94s]  hold on nice by pushing the lane in it takes away an option for the enemy that's something
[10208.94s -> 10211.98s]  that a lot of people think like oh I just want farm I don't care about the farm right
[10211.98s -> 10216.34s]  like when I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game and I'm pushing like
[10216.34s -> 10223.02s]  a mid wave in before a fight. If we're just sieging around the Baron, having that wave
[10223.02s -> 10228.38s]  pushed in gives us another option on what we can do in the game. And it takes you three
[10228.38s -> 10235.26s]  seconds to push it in. So if the fight's already over and you have time, always be
[10235.26s -> 10240.30s]  paying attention to trying to push in waves so that you can create a little bit of that
[10240.30s -> 10244.26s]  pressure. Yo, hail! Thank you so much for the 14, man. Welcome back. What do I
[10244.26s -> 10253.06s]  get next I kind of want to get BT I'm gonna get BT I could get Dom's but I
[10253.06s -> 10257.14s]  think BT's better because the I already have over here right so the shield from
[10257.14s -> 10261.62s]  BT plus shield bow plus IE I don't think I'll be able to die okay I think I'm
[10261.62s -> 10267.06s]  unkillable actually actually unkillable so here I'm gonna actually
[10267.06s -> 10269.58s]  give these camps the federal because he's literally pathing to them I don't
[10269.58s -> 10271.58s]  to be an asshole, but...
[10286.14s -> 10287.14s]  Wow.
[10287.14s -> 10288.50s]  What just happened?
[10288.50s -> 10290.74s]  I'm bad.
[10290.74s -> 10294.54s]  I feel like I got hooked by Kled.
[10294.54s -> 10296.22s]  Oh, he flashed.
[10296.22s -> 10297.90s]  Okay.
[10297.90s -> 10301.98s]  I was like, I feel like what just happened was like, I mispositioned because like I went up here, right?
[10301.98s -> 10304.98s]  Like I ghosted one up here because there was two people here two people here
[10304.98s -> 10310.54s]  I put traps down these kind of sloppy traps and then I positioned here and then clad flashed cued me under the
[10310.54s -> 10312.54s]  Yeah, okay, that makes sense
[10312.54s -> 10314.54s]  I'm just bad
[10315.90s -> 10317.90s]  It was okay though because
[10319.22s -> 10322.34s]  If the entire enemy team has to literally
[10322.34s -> 10329.26s]  Like double flash on you to kill you under the turret and then your team follow us up
[10329.26s -> 10332.86s]  It's not that big of a deal. Galeforce would have saved me there though. Actually
[10334.46s -> 10336.46s]  Loki
[10339.30s -> 10343.02s]  Galeforce totally gonna save me because he has serpents
[10345.66s -> 10350.14s]  Serpents definitely shits on Chobo. I'm kind of stupid for going to show about this game
[10352.34s -> 10357.70s]  I wanted to try it out because I when I before when I was playing Caitlyn like before the IE rework and everything
[10358.14s -> 10359.74s]  everybody would go
[10359.74s -> 10363.58s]  Or there was like one guy in Challenger would go shield bow into shit every game
[10363.58s -> 10368.56s]  And I wanted to see if like it was still viable, but there might just be better options now like always scale for
[10369.74s -> 10371.74s]  Bt or something. Oh
[10374.54s -> 10376.54s]  My god, I flashed late I'm dead
[10376.54s -> 10383.94s]  Dude I flashed late for some reason I'm so dumb my bad
[10385.58s -> 10387.22s]  I was giving him B
[10387.22s -> 10391.78s]  Like my brain is moving slowly like I can feel it turning
[10392.66s -> 10394.66s]  I'm just playing bad
[10394.70s -> 10398.30s]  Like I was baiting the Kled to go in on me because karma was there
[10398.42s -> 10401.18s]  But what I need to do is I need to trap on top myself when he goes in
[10401.74s -> 10404.76s]  Then I need to flash knit and the clutch does
[10406.54s -> 10416.26s]  you can also just kill him I was gonna say they have nothing we just play for
[10416.26s -> 10424.74s]  dragon here I don't know why I'm playing so bad today I played bad yesterday
[10424.74s -> 10427.46s]  I don't know what's going on my like brain is broken
[10444.98s -> 10446.98s]  Dude our con was trying so hard
[10454.74s -> 10484.66s]  Oh, I've made so many mistakes this game.
[10484.66s -> 10492.30s]  I fucked up positioning mechanics farm all kinds of shit
[10499.58s -> 10501.84s]  I still don't want our Dom's actually
[10508.14s -> 10510.14s]  I don't think we're Dom's is good this game
[10510.14s -> 10515.14s]  Like they have no armor like Kled has murk treads
[10516.88s -> 10518.88s]  Which I feel like
[10519.86s -> 10521.86s]  Really bad indoor team, but
[10530.98s -> 10534.86s]  Oh a little tip that you guys can have for Caitlyn too when you are
[10534.86s -> 10537.96s]  Like Barren's up in 50 seconds, right?
[10537.96s -> 10543.42s]  So a little thing you can do that's actually kind of fun is you want to be at the objective before the like
[10543.70s -> 10545.58s]  Rule with them one of the objectives coming up
[10545.58s -> 10548.30s]  You always want to be on that side of the map before the before the objective comes up
[10549.14s -> 10550.94s]  but
[10550.94s -> 10552.94s]  You can put down traps
[10553.14s -> 10555.14s]  in the bushes
[10555.82s -> 10559.42s]  Around the objectives and people will face check them and you can just one tap on my game
[10561.18s -> 10563.18s]  It's actually incredibly fun
[10564.86s -> 10569.58s]  But you just put them in the corners of the bushes where people have to walk
[10575.70s -> 10577.98s]  Like right here I can put it right between the turret
[10589.58s -> 10593.88s]  I don't know why I didn't ghost I'll be honest. I have no idea why didn't ghost
[10594.86s -> 10599.34s]  I was like saving it for something. I'm not sure what
[10602.42s -> 10605.30s]  Next year a birthday present who the fuck knows I
[10609.30s -> 10611.42s]  Could have one shot that guy if I was better at Kate I
[10613.18s -> 10616.50s]  Did a really classic combo right there. I just didn't queue cuz I'm bad I
[10618.50s -> 10621.78s]  Should have when he hit the trap your two headshots sit on him for a few seconds
[10621.78s -> 10625.68s]  So what I should have done is I should have instantly cued on top of the trap then auto auto and he would have died
[10626.16s -> 10631.28s]  Because your cue does the max damage when they're trapped too. So it would have been like just a perfect three shot
[10631.76s -> 10636.32s]  But I said I don't play kate enough and my muscle memories kind of trash sometimes so
[10637.66s -> 10639.66s]  That was my bed
[10649.74s -> 10651.74s]  We're getting cluttered
[10651.78s -> 10653.78s]  I don't know where he is, but...
[10669.78s -> 10671.78s]  Fuck. I shouldn't have done that.
[10674.78s -> 10676.78s]  I'm limit testing really hard right now.
[10676.78s -> 10678.78s]  I suggest you guys don't limit test.
[10678.78s -> 10682.88s]  Well, actually I do think you should limit test but not if you want to win like play safer like right there
[10682.88s -> 10687.58s]  The play wasn't to go back in the play was the like back off, but I wanted to see if I could like I
[10690.24s -> 10692.24s]  Wanted to see if I was terrible or not
[10693.28s -> 10695.54s]  You know I was
[10697.30s -> 10703.70s]  But yeah, I mean the combo with Kate is like if they're trapped you want to queue while they're in the trap essentially because
[10703.70s -> 10707.46s]  because your auto will always give you the range
[10707.46s -> 10709.18s]  so if you auto and then Q,
[10711.54s -> 10713.58s]  when they're trapped they get,
[10713.58s -> 10715.06s]  not a lot of people know this
[10715.06s -> 10717.02s]  because I just found this out like a few years
[10717.02s -> 10719.30s]  or like after I should have.
[10721.06s -> 10723.22s]  When you Q on top of a K trap,
[10723.22s -> 10725.54s]  the way K's Q works is when you Q,
[10725.54s -> 10727.38s]  the initial like it hits initially
[10727.38s -> 10728.38s]  and then it does less damage
[10728.38s -> 10730.58s]  to the targets behind it, right?
[10730.58s -> 10732.66s]  It's very narrow and then it like gets bigger.
[10732.66s -> 10738.44s]  So when they're trapped though, it does the maximum Q damage that it can do in like the
[10738.44s -> 10740.02s]  isolation of the Q.
[10740.02s -> 10745.50s]  So that's why when people are trapped you want to open up with your Q.
[10745.50s -> 10750.82s]  You either want to net into the Q and then double auto, or you want to net or you want
[10750.82s -> 10756.38s]  to like you want to Q, then trap net at the same time, then double auto.
[10756.38s -> 10759.22s]  You basically, it's a very interesting way to play.
[10759.22s -> 10762.10s]  You always want to try and overlay a trap on your trap.
[10762.10s -> 10766.90s]  So when they get trapped, you can overlay a second trap to either in front of them or
[10766.90s -> 10767.90s]  behind them.
[10767.90s -> 10772.46s]  And what will happen is there's actually like a little mini, like I want to say one second
[10772.46s -> 10773.98s]  cooldown of being able to be trapped, right?
[10773.98s -> 10776.34s]  Like a little 1.52 second cooldown.
[10776.34s -> 10778.22s]  But what can happen is they sit in the trap.
[10778.22s -> 10780.32s]  Then what you can do is your neck can slow them.
[10780.32s -> 10783.14s]  So you can actually cue in the first trap.
[10783.14s -> 10787.30s]  Then you can drop a second trap, net slow them into the second trap, and then triple
[10787.30s -> 10791.14s]  auto headshot them from all three of the two traps.
[10791.14s -> 10805.84s]  It's really complicated sounding, but this man does redeemed end my stream whenever
[10805.84s -> 10809.94s]  you want.
[10809.94s -> 10813.54s]  What?
[10813.54s -> 10815.54s]  Why?
[10815.54s -> 10817.54s]  Why?
[10817.54s -> 10823.54s]  Why would you want to end my stream right now?
[10823.54s -> 10830.54s]  Why would you want to be that guy?
[10830.54s -> 10839.54s]  Wow. Okay.
[10839.54s -> 10854.66s]  Don't end, just change the camera position.
[10854.66s -> 10862.58s]  Did you just spend 1 million points to tell me to put the camera back on the right side
[10862.58s -> 10863.58s]  of my fucking-
[10863.58s -> 10878.10s]  No way, no way, you just did that.
[10878.10s -> 10881.30s]  I was like, this man is just flexing.
[10881.30s -> 10883.82s]  He's just like, yeah, I got some points to spare.
[10883.82s -> 10887.66s]  I guess I could like throw him, you know, eh.
[10887.66s -> 10902.14s]  All right, fine.
[10902.14s -> 10903.90s]  There's that better.
[10903.90s -> 10910.54s]  Is that better?
[10910.54s -> 10911.54s]  Drink water.
[10911.54s -> 10912.54s]  Actually, that's a good one.
[10912.54s -> 10913.54s]  I'll be right back.
[10913.54s -> 10916.42s]  I'm going to get some water.
[10916.42s -> 10918.14s]  Should we plan our main?
[10918.14s -> 10920.34s]  I kinda wanna try and hit GM.
[10920.34s -> 10921.30s]  Yeah, let's get on our main account.
[10921.30s -> 10924.22s]  It's like 1 PM, so it's like 3 PM Eastern.
[10924.22s -> 10928.16s]  I think I can get queues at the moment.
[10930.34s -> 10933.18s]  Let me get some water and then we'll queue up.
[10933.18s -> 10935.18s]  Or we'll queue up then get some water, okay?
[10943.22s -> 10944.26s]  Cause I think it's late enough
[10944.26s -> 10953.06s]  day I can get queues now without waiting 40 minutes.
[10953.06s -> 10957.50s]  By the way, it is a teaching stream when I'm doing that like 80 carry academy thing, so
[10957.50s -> 10960.70s]  if you guys have any questions you want to ask or like you guys can ignore that.
[10960.70s -> 10964.46s]  If you guys have any questions you want to ask or anything like that, you know, if
[10964.46s -> 10967.34s]  we're just chilling between games, just ask whatever you want.
[10967.34s -> 10971.94s]  I can answer a lot easier between games that I can't in-game, you know, it's
[10971.94s -> 10973.26s]  a lot easier for me to see that shit.
[10973.26s -> 10976.64s]  I try and answer in-game, but sometimes I'm like focusing and shit.
[10976.64s -> 10984.92s]  So it's a little harder.
[10984.92s -> 10989.64s]  I am gonna get some water though, so I'll be right back.
[10989.64s -> 10991.88s]  Talk amongst yourselves.
[10991.88s -> 10993.36s]  Is Kraken troll on Cait?
[10993.36s -> 10996.10s]  No, Kraken's good on Cait.
[10996.10s -> 11000.96s]  You can go Kraken into Bloodthirster or Kraken into IE if you really need it.
[11000.96s -> 11005.56s]  they have like tanks so they have like Scion, Sujuani, stuff like that you have
[11005.56s -> 11008.68s]  to like you're the only damage let's say you're like the only tank killer on the
[11008.68s -> 11013.88s]  team you're the only 80 damage you have to go cracking sometimes
[11030.96s -> 11033.02s]  you
[11060.96s -> 11073.94s]  Papa Papa Papa Bo
[11073.94s -> 11080.94s]  Best day of my life, my life.
[11103.94s -> 11105.94s]  You
[11523.94s -> 11528.94s]  .
[11528.94s -> 11531.94s]  .
[11531.94s -> 11535.94s]  .
[11535.94s -> 11536.94s]  .
[11536.94s -> 11537.94s]  .
[11537.94s -> 11540.94s]  .
[11540.94s -> 11541.94s]  .
[11541.94s -> 11552.94s]  .
[11552.94s -> 11559.94s]  if you take cleanse.
[11559.94s -> 11561.94s]  What?
[11561.94s -> 11566.94s]  Hmm.
[11566.94s -> 11569.94s]  I'm gonna greed. I might regret this though.
[11569.94s -> 11572.94s]  Like, my gut is telling me to take cleanse.
[11572.94s -> 11576.94s]  Because if I take cleanser, they only have one way to kill me.
[11582.94s -> 11595.54s]  Oh look guys it's 20 yo it's all stylish I think no this is the fake stylish wait isn't
[11595.54s -> 11602.22s]  21 stylish the fake stylish is that the real one or the fake one there's like a fake one
[11602.22s -> 11609.62s]  out there and I don't know if that's the real one or the fake one oh it's stylish nice
[11609.62s -> 11618.94s]  What are we verse again? I'll take long long three
[11639.62s -> 11646.70s]  We'll take long three this game just because I'm
[11654.14s -> 11656.14s]  Warm up a bit
[11658.50s -> 11663.02s]  Actually like long three more against double range because you can't get poked out
[11669.62s -> 11674.26s]  Why don't you like ghost over hill? I do like ghost
[11676.40s -> 11679.32s]  This game particularly I don't think ghost has more value though
[11680.70s -> 11682.22s]  because
[11682.22s -> 11685.70s]  The only like ghost is really good against like triple melee
[11688.34s -> 11691.82s]  Like I like ghosts a lot against like triple melee jumps or comps
[11692.46s -> 11696.16s]  But there's only two male is and one of them. I don't even consider heck or my melee
[11696.16s -> 11701.40s]  That comes like a fucking you motherfucker
[11704.76s -> 11706.76s]  How comes like an assassin song
[11721.80s -> 11723.80s]  You know it's interesting
[11723.80s -> 11726.26s]  This Lulu is bullying the fuck out of us.
[11728.60s -> 11730.60s]  I'm trying to get level 2.
[11736.56s -> 11738.56s]  So I think Lulu has...
[11739.56s -> 11743.02s]  We could, we could just double E that guy.
[11746.72s -> 11748.72s]  Why would you do that?
[11753.80s -> 11760.48s]  I'm confused as to like what's happening here
[11766.44s -> 11768.44s]  Why aren't we fighting these guys
[11770.16s -> 11772.16s]  This this senator this this
[11772.84s -> 11774.26s]  Seraphine's trolling
[11774.26s -> 11776.26s]  So all she had to do there was double e
[11776.80s -> 11781.92s]  That's it if she double e'd either of them they instantly die because we have healed they don't have heal and we have exhaust
[11781.92s -> 11786.24s]  They have they have they have ghosts so all you have to do to win that is double e
[11786.48s -> 11789.44s]  Walk up exhaust the aphelios and we win like he dies
[11792.72s -> 11797.56s]  I'm impressed that this guy's I I don't want to be mean nevermind I
[11799.52s -> 11801.52s]  There's no reason to be mean
[11801.84s -> 11805.34s]  Maybe he just doesn't play seraphine that much. I
[11807.32s -> 11810.16s]  Mean yeah, he like the seraphine should be walking up right now
[11810.16s -> 11814.92s]  You see how like far back she is I can't walk up like at the moments. I just can't
[11825.32s -> 11830.84s]  Oh, that was good fucking Duke I really want to push this oh
[11834.36s -> 11836.52s]  My stylish in God
[11840.16s -> 11842.16s]  At least that was just kind of a god.
[11846.64s -> 11847.14s]  Yeah.
[11848.16s -> 11850.16s]  What the fuck? That was just insane.
[11851.44s -> 11853.44s]  My man's fucking smurfing.
[11856.24s -> 11856.74s]  Jesus.
[11858.16s -> 11860.16s]  Like, that was dirty.
[11862.72s -> 11864.72s]  Guys, nuts.
[11870.16s -> 11892.72s]  I didn't put any points in my e because when we were in the lane I didn't have enough
[11892.72s -> 11899.44s]  I didn't have enough mana to use E anyway.
[11899.44s -> 11902.40s]  So there was no real point to put it in there at the time.
[11902.40s -> 11906.16s]  I kind of wish I had E now, but...
[11906.16s -> 11925.94s]  Oh, that was a misposition. Jesus. I'm just off today. I don't know why. I don't need
[11925.94s -> 11931.44s]  to push this. I can just let it sit. I thinned it a tiny bit. Now, what we can do here
[11931.44s -> 11934.32s]  We just let it sit there. The Felios can't walk up
[11936.76s -> 11941.76s]  Now I would want the seraphine to be like in the bush over there like like up a bit, right?
[11942.28s -> 11947.00s]  Because if she stands in that bush a Felios can't walk up whereas if she's behind me a
[11947.52s -> 11953.68s]  Felios can walk up stand in that bush and soak XP. So stopping the XP soak is very important. I
[11956.68s -> 11961.16s]  Need to run to this fight. I think the fight's over already. I think my team trolled but I'm still gonna run to it
[11961.44s -> 11982.96s]  Not bad, nice.
[11982.96s -> 11986.02s]  So I'm very low right now.
[11986.02s -> 11988.54s]  I think the only thing to do is actually just the back.
[11988.54s -> 11991.08s]  So the way the wave is set up right now?
[11991.08s -> 11993.64s]  I can't push it before they get back to lane.
[11993.64s -> 12000.88s]  It will slow push towards them, but I don't think I have a choice.
[12000.88s -> 12003.32s]  This is something that I'm actually, I'd have to actually rewatch.
[12003.32s -> 12008.84s]  I, no, I think it's actually frozen, but I think maybe I should have cleared one minion,
[12008.84s -> 12015.64s]  maybe two, so that it doesn't crash and it stays frozen.
[12015.64s -> 12018.12s]  Unless I did it correctly.
[12018.12s -> 12019.12s]  Maybe I'm overthinking it.
[12019.12s -> 12024.90s]  All right, I think I did it right. Yeah, I did. Okay, nevermind. I thought I was like overthinking it
[12039.04s -> 12041.86s]  What I think about ghosts instead of healing Jinx, I think it's great
[12042.70s -> 12046.34s]  Like I said, um, this game specifically I think he'll has more value
[12046.34s -> 12049.52s]  But I think in a lot of games ghost is very good
[12050.94s -> 12053.40s]  Ghost is good on ash good on jinx good on a felios
[12053.94s -> 12059.98s]  Zerry like 80 carries at the moment the ghost meta is really good because they're like there's a really heavy like tank
[12059.98s -> 12064.54s]  bruiser meta going on right coupled with like an enchanter e meta or like a
[12065.06s -> 12070.38s]  Bot lane where it's like a bunch of mail is I suck Jesus and because of that. I think it's actually
[12072.06s -> 12073.96s]  Ghost is super good. I just this game
[12073.96s -> 12081.46s]  there's only two melee's in the enemy team and I didn't want to just farm lane
[12081.46s -> 12086.54s]  this I wanted to be able to fight early well okay so the reason you take ghosts
[12086.54s -> 12092.14s]  is because you farm lane you're not looking to fight early when you take
[12092.14s -> 12095.62s]  ghost that's the whole point of ghost it's a scaling it's a hundred percent a
[12095.62s -> 12101.98s]  scaling summoner so if you're playing in lower elo and you you know you want
[12101.98s -> 12108.46s]  to take ghost you want to try it out just realize that like you are trying to scale oh somebody
[12108.46s -> 12120.70s]  afk'd okay that's cringe like if you're in say you're in like gold silver plat whatever
[12120.70s -> 12125.14s]  elo you're in that's like you deemed as like you know a bit of the lower elos I don't even
[12125.14s -> 12129.74s]  think plots that low but a golden silver right um because gold is average so it's like
[12129.74s -> 12136.62s]  not even low typically but everybody says it's low. If you if you take ghost just
[12136.62s -> 12140.38s]  understand that you are playing for mid game bronze still you're playing for
[12140.38s -> 12144.94s]  mid game yeah ghost is fun I would take personally I would probably take heal in
[12144.94s -> 12149.58s]  bronze just because I think you can take advantage of lane phase really hard
[12149.58s -> 12157.02s]  in bronze. Like bronze healer to me is like I should have reported that guy
[12157.02s -> 12159.34s]  I'm stupid bronze able to me is like
[12160.18s -> 12162.18s]  You can learn how to
[12162.86s -> 12168.66s]  Abuse people's lane phase really hard because people will fight a lot in bronze right like they will take bad trades
[12168.66s -> 12172.30s]  Or they will like try and fight because they don't know typically if you're bronze
[12172.30s -> 12176.34s]  You probably don't know like the champions very well and the damage stuff and stuff like that
[12176.58s -> 12181.22s]  So what ends up happening is like you probably just die a bunch or there are probably a lot of deaths and bronze
[12181.66s -> 12183.66s]  so I
[12184.62s -> 12186.62s]  would say
[12186.62s -> 12192.38s]  Playing to like be able to help yourself early game with all the fighting going on is gonna have a lot more value than ghost
[12194.18s -> 12198.54s]  Ghost is more of like a we hit mid game or a giant fight broke out
[12198.54s -> 12202.00s]  And I can like it's an extended long fight and I can get ghost utilization
[12202.54s -> 12205.42s]  Also ghost is really valuable when you have good mechanical skill
[12205.86s -> 12208.52s]  Well, I ghost requires very good positioning typically
[12209.06s -> 12213.86s]  Because you're repositioning a lot in the fight and that's why ghost is so good because you can reposition back for it
[12213.86s -> 12216.12s]  back for it back for it and you can essentially like
[12216.62s -> 12220.22s]  uh, space the enemy and get free damage.
[12223.22s -> 12224.22s]  Free boots too.
[12224.22s -> 12226.02s]  Depends on the champion and the matchup.
[12226.72s -> 12230.42s]  Like, if I'm playing Jinx and I'm playing into like,
[12231.12s -> 12231.92s]  I don't know.
[12232.22s -> 12234.52s]  Let's say I'm playing into like Kaisa Lulu, okay?
[12234.72s -> 12236.12s]  You can take free boots.
[12236.12s -> 12239.62s]  You don't need early boots in that matchup because it's an enchanter farm,
[12239.62s -> 12242.42s]  adc versus an enchanter farm adc, okay?
[12242.72s -> 12245.32s]  Now, if I'm versus, let's say I'm versus like a Blitzcrank.
[12245.32s -> 12247.72s]  Let's say I'm playing Jynx and I'm versus Blitz.
[12247.72s -> 12250.68s]  Like, I typically don't want to have to wait till 9 minutes to get boots
[12250.68s -> 12252.84s]  because Blitzcrank's gonna shit on me.
[12252.84s -> 12258.60s]  So, I will take different runes versus that Blitzcrank to allow myself
[12258.60s -> 12262.52s]  the option of like, let's say I have 1100 gold in my back, I can get early boots,
[12262.52s -> 12266.20s]  and now the Blitzcrank has a much harder time.
[12270.84s -> 12274.20s]  Dude, I almost want to ban Zed because I don't want to get shit on by Stylish,
[12274.20s -> 12278.20s]  But I think it's cringe. I don't want to like ban stylish outs.
[12294.92s -> 12299.24s]  How often does AD carry bot do you play parallel to your support? You try to always.
[12299.24s -> 12306.48s]  Essentially the perfect way to play bot lane is you're both hitting one target at the same
[12306.48s -> 12310.72s]  time trading on one target at the same time you're making like a little triangle and you're
[12310.72s -> 12315.88s]  both just like standing next to each other and you're both hitting that one target right?
[12315.88s -> 12318.64s]  That's the best way to play bot lane but it's very hard in solo queue obviously to
[12318.64s -> 12319.64s]  do that.
[12319.64s -> 12323.72s]  But if you only get duo you can practice it.
[12323.72s -> 12325.80s]  Sorry it went down the wrong pipe.
[12325.80s -> 12328.08s]  80k out of tier list.
[12328.08s -> 12335.80s]  should make one. I have this thing where even though I'm like grandmaster level, I still
[12335.80s -> 12340.40s]  think I suck. I have this like really lack of confidence because I used to be challenger
[12340.40s -> 12344.16s]  and now I'm like hard stuck GM. So like I have this lack of confidence in what I'm talking
[12344.16s -> 12349.04s]  about. So like I feel like if I were to make a tier list, it would be based on like a
[12349.04s -> 12357.12s]  GM players skill. And I don't know if like I don't want to get ripped apart by people.
[12357.12s -> 12364.12s]  But I guess I could make a tier list from my own opinion.
[12364.12s -> 12378.84s]  Hey, let me see tier list maker.
[12378.84s -> 12381.16s]  I'm sure there's a tierless maker with champions, right?
[12408.84s -> 12416.48s]  Yeah, there it is wait this is terrible. What is what are these pictures?
[12422.72s -> 12428.40s]  I'm just what what is this? What is this? Why is Nico on here?
[12438.84s -> 12441.84s]  I want to use this one, but this one doesn't have Zary.
[12445.84s -> 12448.84s]  I'm trying to find one with Zary on it that doesn't look like shit.
[12448.84s -> 12453.84s]  It says this one has Zary, but it looks like it looks shitty. I don't enjoy that.
[12464.84s -> 12467.84s]  Hold on, we're gonna play Ash this game because they picked Zareth.
[12468.44s -> 12471.60s]  Like I just saw him first pick Zerath so I want something that can engage on the Zerath
[12473.24s -> 12476.76s]  So we're gonna go ash these gonna be my ashrines this game boys
[12481.16s -> 12483.16s]  Don't want to go presence of mind I
[12485.84s -> 12487.84s]  Don't know I
[12490.04s -> 12495.92s]  Kind of do but I kind of don't I think presence of mind kind of sucks. It feels kind of shitty
[12497.84s -> 12504.74s]  Hmm we can just do overkill we can go Lackardy I
[12507.26s -> 12510.22s]  Probably won't go crack inside of this game, so we could probably just go Lackardy
[12511.90s -> 12515.06s]  Even though crack inside is not battle Nash. I kind of want to go board crush
[12521.86s -> 12523.86s]  But I could go
[12527.84s -> 12531.80s]  Actually don't know what I want to take if I want to take borderline or a lacquerty. I'm gonna take a lacquer. We'll try it out
[12533.00s -> 12535.00s]  And then we'll do ghost. Okay. Um
[12535.96s -> 12537.96s]  Was I gonna say? Oh
[12538.68s -> 12541.20s]  Yeah, yeah, I need to find the right tier list
[12545.64s -> 12549.94s]  I mean I could just use this right I can't where's Zerry
[12549.94s -> 12563.82s]  Oh, there we go. Yeah, this is good. Okay. I was like, I was trying to figure it out.
[12563.82s -> 12570.10s]  I was like, what the fuck? I think just straight out of the gate, I was putting Jinx and S tier.
[12570.10s -> 12578.26s]  I think Jinx is just an S tier champion. She's crazy OP. Like Jinx just does whatever champion
[12578.26s -> 12584.04s]  Wants to do but like better than them. She's blind pickable her two item three Adam spike is crazy
[12585.00s -> 12589.18s]  She's doesn't have a lot of like really bad matchups and lane phase anymore
[12589.74s -> 12592.94s]  They gave her scaling like crazy high like she's just good
[12594.30s -> 12597.06s]  Good build paths, etc. I guess she's just a good champion
[12599.90s -> 12604.90s]  I would say it's also hard to do tier list because you have to do tier list for like low elo and high elo
[12604.90s -> 12608.10s]  Right because if I'm doing like a low elo tier list
[12608.74s -> 12610.74s]  You're putting a math like here
[12611.58s -> 12615.66s]  Right like MF super good. If you're doing a high elo tier list MF's like here
[12617.10s -> 12623.94s]  It's it's hard to explain and like in low elo I'm putting Calista here, but in high elo I'm putting her here
[12625.46s -> 12627.46s]  So it's it's really interesting
[12631.22s -> 12634.06s]  Right because it's all based on like people's mechanical skill too
[12634.90s -> 12637.18s]  Yeah, we do the tier list between games, I guess
[12638.26s -> 12643.22s]  So far, I think Jinx is definitely asked here. I wish there was like an s-plus here
[12645.26s -> 12647.26s]  But Jinx is definitely asked here
[12647.70s -> 12652.94s]  Draven's hard to choose for me like I want to put him in a tier because he has a lot of counter matchups
[12652.94s -> 12655.94s]  But in solo queue Draven feels insane
[12658.46s -> 12662.74s]  So it's hard because I don't think I think Draven's overrated personally
[12662.74s -> 12669.50s]  because I know how to beat Draven players, but I also think in high elo when
[12669.50s -> 12678.02s]  people also know how to deal with Draven players the game I also do feel like a
[12678.02s -> 12681.58s]  good Draven players and good people who know how to play around Draven players
[12681.58s -> 12685.30s]  make Draven OP but it's also the opposite where good players you know
[12685.30s -> 12688.62s]  how to play around Draven can counter pick Draven and make him worthless so
[12688.62s -> 12695.62s]  So it's really, it's really hard.
[12695.62s -> 12718.06s]  All right, let me say Morgana versus a Moo Moo, E Moo Moo.
[12718.06s -> 12724.54s]  players. Gin players are psychopaths man. I don't think Gin's very good right now. I
[12724.54s -> 12727.94s]  think he could be good if they gave him a quality life change. Isn't he getting buffed
[12727.94s -> 12737.66s]  next patch? I think he's getting buffed. I think he should do. Gin's such a fun
[12737.66s -> 12749.86s]  champ, he's just like a little shitty.
[12749.86s -> 12756.22s]  We can actually just straight fight them right now, if Mumu just queues.
[12756.22s -> 12760.66s]  Because Morgana's worth us level one.
[12760.66s -> 12769.54s]  Like I actually just straight up want to fight these guys right now go go go
[12780.54s -> 12786.30s]  I hope he missed both his cues dude this guy this a move was killing me man. Oh
[12788.22s -> 12790.22s]  My god, I
[12790.66s -> 12806.46s]  bro what am I watching what are the what are these cues brother all right
[12806.46s -> 12809.38s]  should have taken a long sword
[12809.38s -> 12811.38s]  I
[12811.62s -> 12814.34s]  Moomoo is not feeling himself today. Let me tell you what
[12817.10s -> 12819.10s]  He is not feel himself
[12834.54s -> 12837.02s]  Chase even if there's comes chase
[12837.02s -> 12839.02s]  Okay, we run
[12845.66s -> 12850.06s]  I don't know if we can fight this we can try I'll follow
[12864.02s -> 12866.02s]  Well, I mean that guy should die
[12867.02s -> 12876.22s]  Dude what I don't even know what's happening right now. This is this is crazy
[12879.78s -> 12884.44s]  This is ridiculous both mid laners just got like three kills out of nowhere
[12884.44s -> 12899.04s]  We went from like a ridiculously we went from like a grandmaster game to like a diamond game
[12899.04s -> 12909.28s]  like somehow like the emu moves like kind of whipping some shit I took a bad trade early
[12909.28s -> 12912.48s]  Then fucking this shit is funny as fuck
[12915.76s -> 12918.02s]  So I'm gonna I'm gonna actually rush tier two boots this game
[12919.30s -> 12921.30s]  Because I actually really
[12921.56s -> 12923.56s]  really really
[12923.72s -> 12925.72s]  Want to be mobile against their team
[12925.96s -> 12931.48s]  Like I'm just gonna straight up leave go by T2 boots and that's gonna be my my power spike for ash right now
[12933.32s -> 12938.68s]  They have so many things that I can dodge on their team like look at the shit right like morgue binding
[12939.28s -> 12942.36s]  T2 boots, super easy to dodge if she can't flash it on me, right?
[12942.36s -> 12944.56s]  Or if she can't flash melee range with the Morg bind.
[12944.56s -> 12948.00s]  It's, I should never get hit by it unless I have no fingers.
[12948.00s -> 12950.20s]  Ezreal Q, easy to dodge.
[12950.20s -> 12952.08s]  Xerath, easy to dodge.
[12952.08s -> 12954.24s]  This guy, whatever the fuck,
[12954.24s -> 12956.28s]  Kozak, Bugman, he's a melee champ,
[12956.28s -> 12958.36s]  so boots have value, et cetera.
[12963.20s -> 12965.84s]  Also, the cool thing about boots, Boots Rush Ash,
[12965.84s -> 12967.24s]  is she does enough damage
[12967.24s -> 12972.24s]  That if I'm good at spacing like the better at spacing you are
[12973.56s -> 12975.56s]  You can actually just 1v2
[12976.60s -> 12978.60s]  Especially against double skill shots like this
[12979.72s -> 12981.72s]  It's pretty fun
[12997.24s -> 13008.36s]  Fuck, if I juke that last Q I would've killed that guy.
[13008.36s -> 13011.76s]  Dude, Zerath actually fucked us so bad though.
[13011.76s -> 13015.92s]  That was a good fight until Zerath just showed up and beat our ass.
[13015.92s -> 13031.64s]  Yeah, just get the minion wave.
[13031.64s -> 13035.92s]  It's kind of funny to watch though because I do so little damage but I also like just
[13035.92s -> 13042.08s]  perma slow so they can't do anything about it.
[13042.08s -> 13047.58s]  Maybe when TF gets 6, he can come bot and we can fuck over their bot lane.
[13047.58s -> 13049.88s]  I'm hoping that that's the case.
[13049.88s -> 13057.28s]  Oh, we're gonna roam to mid.
[13057.28s -> 13059.28s]  Cosx is also mid.
[13059.28s -> 13061.28s]  TF's dead.
[13061.28s -> 13066.88s]  That was a good roam.
[13066.88s -> 13074.84s]  I'm gonna push this so that maybe we can play for a dragon because they might go for a dragon here
[13074.84s -> 13076.84s]  And I think we can stop it
[13078.40s -> 13080.40s]  We have tf ults
[13084.04s -> 13086.04s]  Yep
[13088.08s -> 13090.08s]  Nice we just leave
[13090.24s -> 13093.76s]  We don't need to actually chase or do anything crazy. We're just stopping the dragon. That's all we're doing
[13093.76s -> 13102.46s]  Right, we don't want to give them a free drink.
[13102.46s -> 13104.06s]  See the t2 boots are just broken.
[13104.06s -> 13112.06s]  They're broken as shit.
[13112.06s -> 13117.86s]  You can just see like I can pretty much just, I'm just too fast for them to deal with.
[13117.86s -> 13130.90s]  Like look at this, it's insane.
[13130.90s -> 13136.06s]  And that's why I value like the tier 2 boots on champions, especially like Ashe where you
[13136.06s -> 13141.42s]  can be extra egregious with it, because like, her slow, imagine it's like, you know, it's
[13141.42s -> 13144.02s]  the same idea as Vayne, right, when you think about it.
[13144.02s -> 13146.66s]  It's like, okay, so what's really annoying
[13146.66s -> 13149.14s]  trying to run away from a vein, right?
[13149.14s -> 13150.34s]  She gets boots too and you're like,
[13150.34s -> 13152.26s]  God damn it, man, she's so fast.
[13152.26s -> 13155.30s]  Same thing with Ash, oh wait, now you're slow.
[13155.30s -> 13156.26s]  So it's even more annoying.
[13156.26s -> 13158.38s]  You try and go in on her, she just spaces you,
[13158.38s -> 13160.30s]  walks away a bit, now you're just sitting there
[13160.30s -> 13162.30s]  waddling towards her slowly, just upset,
[13162.30s -> 13163.56s]  tilted, frustrated.
[13164.90s -> 13167.10s]  You know, it's like your middle school dance.
[13174.02s -> 13194.82s]  You know what I think this is actually a shield bow game it is I was gonna go
[13194.82s -> 13199.62s]  Bork but I think this is a shield bow game it could be a gale force game too
[13199.62s -> 13206.34s]  both both are both are viable but uh i actually i might be one of the i might be in the minority
[13206.34s -> 13213.06s]  here with this i think bork rush on ash is actually good sometimes like i think if i was
[13213.06s -> 13217.30s]  versus some tanks like you know like a scion or something like that i actually think bork rush
[13217.30s -> 13222.42s]  on ash is kind of cracked like yeah it stalls out like you make the argument like it stalls
[13222.42s -> 13229.94s]  or three item or two item but it feels kind of nuts. Also this is a really OP thing that you
[13229.94s -> 13235.14s]  can do I should have hawkshotted sooner. I knew that they were doing a rift but I'm not paying
[13235.14s -> 13247.06s]  attention as much as I should be so because what you can do is you can hawkshot to tell your team
[13247.06s -> 13249.46s]  Where the enemy jungler is and get information yourself
[13253.54s -> 13255.54s]  I mean this morgana is level five
[13257.54s -> 13259.94s]  We could fight just because morgan's five right now
[13261.78s -> 13263.78s]  Uh, I kind of want to try
[13268.50s -> 13272.10s]  Uh-oh my moomoo didn't want to go in my bed
[13272.10s -> 13280.78s]  I'm a little sad. I'm not gonna lie because I do feel like we win these fights, but a
[13280.78s -> 13286.04s]  moomoo wants to wait for six, which is fine. But like I said, you guys know me. I like to
[13286.04s -> 13292.50s]  actually fight and be active in the lane early because I know that we can fight, right?
[13292.50s -> 13294.50s]  So it's like obviously, you know
[13303.50s -> 13306.92s]  This is really rough I can't do anything
[13309.54s -> 13311.54s]  Because there it's here
[13312.38s -> 13317.38s]  Tf's coming with old though. I don't have old. Damn it if I don't this would be so God tier
[13317.38s -> 13325.38s]  God, you have no idea how OP this would be if I had ulti, man, whatever, I'm bad.
[13325.38s -> 13332.02s]  I want to push this wave out, I'm assuming they're all backing.
[13332.02s -> 13336.02s]  I think we penta there, we even killed the top laner, oh I'm dead.
[13336.02s -> 13338.34s]  Why did I stay?
[13338.34s -> 13340.78s]  I knew Koziks would do that.
[13340.78s -> 13344.26s]  I have to retrain my brain, Koziks players are rats, and I have to retrain my brain
[13344.26s -> 13349.38s]  Remember that they will sit in a bush for 30 minutes lose all of their farm to get one kill. I
[13350.10s -> 13352.10s]  Like always forget that
[13355.02s -> 13357.46s]  Like cause expires are absolute fucking rats
[13361.50s -> 13368.00s]  Like I respect Rengar players more than cause expires. Yeah, I said it I know hot take I know but I do
[13371.54s -> 13373.54s]  I'm gonna try an arrow right here
[13374.26s -> 13380.46s]  Got him.
[13380.46s -> 13383.66s]  You know that guy's pissed by the way.
[13383.66s -> 13385.86s]  God damn it.
[13385.86s -> 13393.78s]  He's gonna try and ult me from the bush.
[13393.78s -> 13397.86s]  You can always tell that you're about to get ulted when an Ezreal, big tip for you guys.
[13397.86s -> 13403.58s]  If an Ezreal ever walks out of vision, expect that he's ulting you.
[13403.58s -> 13408.74s]  You would not believe the amount of people that I kill with Ezreal by simply walking into
[13408.74s -> 13414.14s]  a bush and ulting them and they forget that I exist.
[13414.14s -> 13416.74s]  It happens so often.
[13416.74s -> 13421.42s]  They're just like, oh yeah, he went in the bush, he's going to hit his ult key.
[13421.42s -> 13424.42s]  It is comical how often it happens.
[13424.42s -> 13429.98s]  And I'm sure you guys have died to it too, because it's like a thing where you barely
[13429.98s -> 13434.66s]  You don't see Ezreal that often, right? So because you probably don't see Ezreal too often you're always like oh
[13437.02s -> 13439.02s]  Interesting type shit
[13442.94s -> 13445.64s]  I'm gonna grab this plate and then I'm gonna back up
[13447.58s -> 13450.02s]  Cosics is coming down here, so I'm gonna back the fuck up
[13451.32s -> 13456.10s]  So I don't have arrow for 20 Ezreal has triforce. We need to back up a bit
[13456.10s -> 13463.94s]  We might have to give dragon I could see giving dragon being okay though. It's not that bad
[13472.42s -> 13477.44s]  Yeah, it's not it's not the worst to give Drake here I can even back so we don't get dove
[13479.26s -> 13482.34s]  Like if we back now we might lose bot turret, but I can't walk up
[13482.34s -> 13489.22s]  Yeah, that's what I didn't want to have happen see that's
[13492.46s -> 13496.14s]  I'm telling you bad rats absolute rats
[13500.50s -> 13504.10s]  Cosics players are rats man absolute literal rats
[13512.34s -> 13527.26s]  Oh that's classy. That's a good dodge. I can't even walk up bot. I can wait for the
[13527.26s -> 13534.02s]  turret but I can't walk up. I'll just die. That's another thing you have to just accept.
[13534.02s -> 13539.34s]  Like I'm down 40 CS this game because we've just been getting weak-sided and we've also
[13539.34s -> 13546.78s]  been getting uh like umumu is not very good i don't i don't have a better way to say it
[13546.78s -> 13552.06s]  i don't have like a nice way to say it he's not having a good game and when your support
[13552.06s -> 13556.54s]  doesn't have a good game you don't have a good game early so the best thing you can do is just
[13556.54s -> 13564.86s]  try and uh farm up what you can don't die and scale for late it's all you can really do
[13564.86s -> 13572.44s]  as an AD carry when your support sucks. It feels really bad but sometimes you just
[13572.44s -> 13575.16s]  got to accept it, right?
[13581.06s -> 13586.78s]  The Cezaril's not bad but he's not good either. Oh, this guy's gonna try and
[13586.78s -> 13607.94s]  help me I'm an old kill ran chair nice I don't have all up yet guys I don't have
[13607.94s -> 13616.14s]  all top yet I can't ulti I have all now but we need to bait them in a bit I don't
[13616.14s -> 13622.54s]  even want to use my ult right now to be honest with you. Like I really don't. You know what's
[13622.54s -> 13625.26s]  funny that Xerath's actually pretty good. I've played against him a few times in the
[13625.26s -> 13631.86s]  past few seasons. He's actually not bad. He used to be a support main. Like he played
[13631.86s -> 13645.86s]  Xerath's support. That's why I recognized his name. We should not go for this ref.
[13645.86s -> 13653.86s]  I'm on a bad timer for this because I'm really low HP and mana.
[13653.86s -> 13671.30s]  Ooh, I don't have mana to arrow here guys.
[13671.30s -> 13674.86s]  I do not want to arrow that because the Fiora can totally...
[13674.86s -> 13683.96s]  The Fiora can do whatever it's called and the Fiora can, uh, what's it, whatever it's
[13683.96s -> 13689.16s]  called, uh, W it if she's fast enough and I didn't want to get my team killed.
[13689.16s -> 13692.76s]  The real issue here is that we're forcing, okay, I'll tell you exactly what the real
[13692.76s -> 13695.72s]  issue is.
[13695.72s -> 13698.52s]  We're forcing too many fights for no reason right now.
[13698.52s -> 13701.20s]  So like we're all forcing tons of fights at the moment, right?
[13701.20s -> 13703.20s]  But there's no reason for us to force these fights.
[13704.84s -> 13707.12s]  That's why my team's getting tilted, right?
[13707.12s -> 13711.04s]  Like, for some reason, the Amumu and the TF
[13711.04s -> 13712.80s]  are both just like inting,
[13712.80s -> 13713.84s]  and they're both getting frustrated,
[13713.84s -> 13716.40s]  but we actually win the game if we play it slow.
[13717.76s -> 13719.60s]  Like, we can slow play this game out in scale,
[13719.60s -> 13720.84s]  but it just takes time.
[13727.40s -> 13729.28s]  Cause I specifically picked Ash
[13729.28s -> 13731.20s]  so that we had an answer for Xerath.
[13732.08s -> 13733.56s]  Because we have TF and Ash, right?
[13733.56s -> 13735.80s]  So we have a really good answer for him.
[13735.80s -> 13739.80s]  The problem is, we need to stop tilting
[13739.80s -> 13742.76s]  and just understand that we can deal with him later.
[13742.76s -> 13744.80s]  He's not like an A-Soul, right?
[13744.80s -> 13746.16s]  Like, A-Soul is one of those champs
[13746.16s -> 13747.92s]  that you can't deal with.
[13751.36s -> 13753.88s]  Why did my Moo Moo wait to use ulti?
[13755.16s -> 13756.00s]  What?
[13757.28s -> 13758.56s]  He was in range.
[13759.28s -> 13775.06s]  I know he was oh nice okay we gotta kill we need TF to play the game too though our
[13775.06s -> 13782.62s]  TF is really tilted so he's just sitting bot a moomoo is extra tilted too but I
[13782.62s -> 13786.58s]  mean I'll be honest the moomoo is playing worse than TF it's just that
[13786.58s -> 13791.04s]  He's dude. I hate when stuff happens like this stop stop pinging the guy man
[13791.46s -> 13794.50s]  He's already frustrated you pinging him is not gonna make him less frustrated
[13795.38s -> 13797.38s]  You're just gonna piss him off more
[13798.54s -> 13800.54s]  Like just play dude
[13802.54s -> 13808.18s]  We have a really good team comp like we're behind right now, but we have a good team comp
[13814.26s -> 13816.26s]  We should give this dragon by the way
[13816.58s -> 13819.84s]  They got 1000% we don't have tfholtz
[13819.84s -> 13825.20s]  Like maybe we could fight this but the morg's here so she can spell through my arrow
[13825.20s -> 13830.20s]  They got rift, like we should give the drink
[13830.20s -> 13832.48s]  We also have no vision control of this area
[13832.48s -> 13838.28s]  So this is another thing of like why, you guys wonder like why I play support in this hero
[13838.28s -> 13841.28s]  Like I get asked a lot like why are you a support man now
[13841.28s -> 13844.56s]  I'm still an 80 man but the thing is it's really hard
[13844.56s -> 13849.20s]  to play the game when your supports don't word correctly
[13849.20s -> 13852.92s]  we can give this guy's we can give it's not a huge deal and ours top
[13852.92s -> 13856.72s]  we do not have to fight this guys we don't have to fight this
[13856.72s -> 13863.72s]  it's back up yeah like this isn't fight
[13864.64s -> 13871.64s]  it's only second dragon it's nothing wow I suck at CSing
[13874.56s -> 13882.52s]  But you see how little vision control we have on the map right now?
[13882.52s -> 13885.60s]  We have one ward here and that's about it.
[13885.60s -> 13889.28s]  Vision control is, I say it's 90% of the game in solo queue.
[13889.28s -> 13892.40s]  That's why I feel like supports are like the unsung hero, like when you get a support
[13892.40s -> 13899.12s]  who knows how to properly throw out vision control, it feels insane.
[13899.12s -> 13905.00s]  We just got to push.
[13905.00s -> 13907.00s]  I do have Hawkshot in a second.
[13907.00s -> 13909.00s]  We can see if they're on this.
[13909.00s -> 13912.36s]  Okay, they're not.
[13912.36s -> 13913.36s]  I can voli.
[13913.36s -> 13916.84s]  We can back up.
[13916.84s -> 13920.64s]  Kozix is above me right now.
[13920.64s -> 13924.84s]  Okay, Kozix wasted his ult.
[13924.84s -> 13927.28s]  That's not bad.
[13927.28s -> 13928.28s]  We should back.
[13928.28s -> 13931.60s]  I don't want to take this fight TF could ulti, but he's not
[13932.48s -> 13934.20s]  right
[13934.20s -> 13938.44s]  Like this this is one of those moments where like I actually think we actually could have killed two of them right there
[13938.80s -> 13940.80s]  If you have ulted
[13940.96s -> 13942.96s]  Because they were out of position really hard
[13945.36s -> 13947.36s]  But again, it's not like I
[13948.96s -> 13951.64s]  Think they're gonna walk. I think Cos Exis
[13953.08s -> 13955.08s]  Yeah, he's he's somewhere up here. I don't know where he is
[13955.08s -> 13960.04s]  And I can't I think I can't hawk shot I wasted my hawk shot for this dragon or this Baron
[13962.10s -> 13964.10s]  They could be on Baron
[13964.40s -> 13966.40s]  We need to check but I have no hawk shots
[13966.92s -> 13970.64s]  Okay, they're not they're not we're chilling good. Good. I need a hundred golds
[13970.64s -> 13986.96s]  Yeah, I'm aware I'm getting ganked I'm fully fucking aware trust me
[14000.64s -> 14006.64s]  I'm just trying to force them to make a choice probably wasn't a great use of my ghost, but
[14017.64s -> 14019.64s]  I say we bail I need to go get my item
[14021.64s -> 14024.64s]  Israel's just pushing aside somehow I'm contested over there
[14030.64s -> 14038.22s]  Somebody just TP'd bot, what?
[14038.22s -> 14040.90s]  What the fuck is this Amumu doing?
[14040.90s -> 14041.90s]  What is my team doing?
[14041.90s -> 14042.90s]  What are you guys doing?
[14042.90s -> 14053.58s]  This is so awkward, man.
[14053.58s -> 14056.14s]  I mean, guys?
[14056.14s -> 14057.58s]  Guys kill the Causics.
[14057.58s -> 14066.70s]  Oh thank god. I don't know why Cosyx just dove to kill me of all people. My man just
[14066.70s -> 14076.26s]  like wanted me dead. He was like yeah fuck that 80 carry guy. Like okay. Sure. Fuck me.
[14076.26s -> 14083.62s]  What do I want? I feel like I need damage but I don't know what gives me the highest
[14083.62s -> 14085.96s]  Damage here maybe just
[14091.58s -> 14095.90s]  No, maybe just PD I'm not actually sure I
[14098.02s -> 14103.78s]  You would be good, but it doesn't give me like more it gives me like eyes interesting in this position
[14105.46s -> 14108.02s]  Like I almost want more movement speed from the like PD
[14108.02s -> 14113.78s]  Even though normally like the utilities better like maybe BT is still the best and I'm just trolling
[14119.90s -> 14121.90s]  We can just do dragon right now
[14122.46s -> 14126.02s]  They have no TP here Baron. I think we totally actually could do this
[14127.06s -> 14129.28s]  I'm down to try if you if you want to rain gar
[14131.02s -> 14134.22s]  They got two people bought they're setting up for dragon vision right now
[14134.22s -> 14137.82s]  I'm actually kind of down to just try and play for Baron here
[14144.72s -> 14149.02s]  Like we could bait Baron here and force them to walk into us with my arrow
[14164.22s -> 14179.24s]  I want to stay together because I don't know where the
[14179.24s -> 14197.96s]  Kha'zix's. Found him. What is my Mumu doing? Dude, he has smite. Like, I pull it out if
[14197.96s -> 14198.80s]  if you're gonna do this, right?
[14198.80s -> 14201.40s]  Like, like use your brain, man.
[14217.56s -> 14219.74s]  All right, now we do Baron though, we have to.
[14219.74s -> 14220.78s]  We have to do Baron.
[14224.64s -> 14226.16s]  This is like one of the worst players
[14226.16s -> 14227.16s]  I've ever seen this in Moomoo.
[14227.16s -> 14230.24s]  He has no clue what he's doing, by the way.
[14230.24s -> 14231.64s]  Like, he's so dumb.
[14236.36s -> 14238.48s]  He's like, flaming the TF.
[14238.48s -> 14240.44s]  In his mind, he's so angry at this TF
[14240.44s -> 14243.52s]  that he's ignoring every single thing that's going on.
[14243.52s -> 14244.60s]  Like, he's ignoring that, like,
[14244.60s -> 14246.64s]  the dragon was a bad call to begin with.
[14247.84s -> 14249.12s]  And if we are gonna do that dragon,
[14249.12s -> 14251.24s]  we have to zone the fucking jungle
[14251.24s -> 14254.28s]  because he has fucking, it's might, right?
[14254.28s -> 14255.12s]  So it's like,
[14255.12s -> 14263.34s]  Like what are you talking about, but these players are crazy. It just feels to me like they're so angry at everything
[14263.34s -> 14265.34s]  It's kind of funny
[14266.30s -> 14271.02s]  Okay, I got three items now I went for the PD because I kind of think the extra movement speed and the extra
[14271.98s -> 14273.98s]  It'll help a lot I
[14275.54s -> 14279.54s]  Will say both the junglers are playing really well this game is like
[14280.66s -> 14282.58s]  interesting
[14282.58s -> 14286.38s]  Like both the assassin junglers are playing pretty well the enemy Xerath's playing pretty decent
[14293.26s -> 14299.70s]  What that is not a I I mean that was embarrassing like I don't even have words for that
[14301.46s -> 14303.78s]  Like I genuinely don't have words for that shit. I
[14306.14s -> 14308.14s]  Missed I
[14308.14s -> 14314.10s]  I can't see we have no vision man
[14320.66s -> 14326.18s]  Like we have no vision nothing's warded because the moomoo didn't put any wards down
[14329.22s -> 14334.66s]  So I can't fight because literally we're standing there in this area and there's nothing warded
[14338.14s -> 14343.66s]  The best part is all a moomoo had to do was not die before that fight and we auto win
[14344.06s -> 14346.30s]  But we were winning so hard
[14346.30s -> 14349.96s]  But this a moomoo is actually solo losing us the game with this fucking ego
[14350.82s -> 14353.16s]  God support players are so bad at league
[14356.02s -> 14358.02s]  Actually
[14359.02s -> 14365.38s]  And they'll deflect support players will will lie to themselves about how good they are and tell them that it's always their
[14365.38s -> 14372.50s]  team's fault, but they'll drop 9 deaths, have 9kp in a fucking 23 kill game, and then blame
[14372.50s -> 14375.34s]  their fucking team.
[14375.34s -> 14385.06s]  It's crazy.
[14385.06s -> 14394.62s]  Please ward things, man.
[14394.62s -> 14396.56s]  Oh my god.
[14396.56s -> 14397.50s]  He's dead again.
[14404.46s -> 14407.54s]  Guys, why are we up here top?
[14407.54s -> 14408.84s]  Why are we top guys?
[14415.40s -> 14417.30s]  Why are we three manning top right now?
[14418.62s -> 14419.92s]  Holy crap.
[14421.38s -> 14423.42s]  My teammates are absolute apes.
[14423.42s -> 14438.66s]  like what am I watching men they just three man's top oh my god like these are
[14438.66s -> 14444.06s]  the worst players I've ever fucking seen like we had the game in our hands and
[14444.06s -> 14448.30s]  then all of a sudden my team's like you know what I don't actually want to win
[14448.30s -> 14449.30s]  And I'm like, why?
[14449.30s -> 14452.38s]  And they're like, well, you see.
[14452.38s -> 14453.38s]  I have an ego.
[14453.38s -> 14455.58s]  And you're like, oh, I see.
[14455.58s -> 14457.74s]  This is why I can't play AD Carry in the Zelo.
[14457.74s -> 14458.74s]  I'm sorry.
[14458.74s -> 14459.74s]  I can't.
[14459.74s -> 14465.42s]  I have to play support in the Zelo because AD Carry is actually not playable when the
[14465.42s -> 14470.70s]  entire game is decided by jungle, support, and mid.
[14470.70s -> 14475.14s]  AD Carry does not decide any of the League of Legends games below Grandmaster.
[14475.14s -> 14476.14s]  Not one of them.
[14476.14s -> 14480.94s]  Last game, we popped off and won because we were the better AD carry.
[14480.94s -> 14483.14s]  This game, it doesn't matter.
[14483.14s -> 14490.14s]  Because TF does 11k damage, doesn't ulti bot more than one time, Rengar did well, Narr
[14490.14s -> 14495.58s]  did well, but they also had a horrible macro.
[14495.58s -> 14500.66s]  It is insane to me how easy support is as a role and at just how dogshit every support
[14500.66s -> 14503.18s]  player is on the server.
[14503.18s -> 14506.18s]  Your role requires zero thought.
[14506.18s -> 14512.16s]  Your thought when playing support is, do I get vision or not?
[14512.16s -> 14515.78s]  If no, where can I be the most useful?
[14515.78s -> 14523.00s]  Your thought should never be, this game's over, my team sucks.
[14523.00s -> 14525.98s]  It drives me ludicrous.
[14525.98s -> 14531.90s]  I'm sorry that I have to play support on this account to climb, but it's crazy
[14531.90s -> 14535.30s]  how dog shit adc is when you're solo queuing in masters.
[14535.30s -> 14540.42s]  Like, in GM, if it's a full GM game, adc is easy as fuck.
[14540.42s -> 14544.66s]  If everybody has a brain activity and they're not idiots, adc is amazing.
[14544.66s -> 14545.92s]  Favorite role in the game.
[14545.92s -> 14549.08s]  When you're playing with people who don't know what they're doing and you're actively
[14549.08s -> 14554.10s]  trying to climb and improve, it genuinely feels like I'm pulling out a ball hair with
[14554.10s -> 14559.10s]  my tweezers.
[14559.10s -> 14561.10s]  It is so painful.
[14564.10s -> 14566.10s]  It's crazy.
[14568.60s -> 14572.10s]  Let's take a look at this support main right now.
[14572.10s -> 14575.10s]  97 LP, negative win rate, right?
[14576.10s -> 14583.10s]  I could literally tell that he was not a good player in the first 30 seconds of that game.
[14583.10s -> 14589.98s]  I'm sorry I'm being mean, but dude this has been driving me crazy
[14594.10s -> 14600.34s]  Like look at the way the support I had last game also, can I ask a question? Why am I even allowed?
[14601.10s -> 14608.82s]  Why am I even allowed to be in games with a challenger support one game? I win the game
[14608.82s -> 14622.30s]  then immediately it puts me in a game with a 97 LP master support. What is this matchmaking?
[14622.30s -> 14634.74s]  This is insane!
[14634.74s -> 14635.58s]  That's crazy!
[14652.30s -> 14660.98s]  I don't even I'm wondering why
[14664.90s -> 14668.18s]  So I'm gonna go on a rant for a second. Why is this allowed?
[14668.82s -> 14674.42s]  Why can you be in a game? Why can I be in a game with a literal guy who's about to promote to challenger?
[14675.58s -> 14681.82s]  Right we win the game and then the very next game it puts me in a game with a guy who's 97 LP
[14682.30s -> 14689.30s]  This is insane.
[14689.30s -> 14709.38s]  Sorry, that's just frustrating as fuck, because it's like such bad game design, right?
[14709.38s -> 14718.30s]  Like that's 900 LP difference.
[14718.30s -> 14722.98s]  And the thing is, this guy doesn't have good MMR, right?
[14722.98s -> 14728.06s]  Like it's not like this guy has good MMR, right?
[14728.06s -> 14729.82s]  Because look at his games.
[14729.82s -> 14732.14s]  He's playing with all master's players.
[14732.14s -> 14737.26s]  They're all like 100 LP masters, 70 LP, 30 LP, right?
[14737.26s -> 14738.26s]  It doesn't make sense.
[14738.26s -> 14744.80s]  like his MMR is high so why is this guy getting into like a 600 LP grandmaster
[14744.80s -> 14750.10s]  game? Why are we putting that guy in the game? That's so frustrating so I just I
[14750.10s -> 14752.58s]  needed the vents.
[14756.46s -> 14760.88s]  How do you know which AD carry pick in each situation? It's a lot of knowledge.
[14760.88s -> 14762.88s]  a lot of knowledge.
[14764.16s -> 14766.16s]  Like you have to know a
[14766.72s -> 14768.08s]  lot of shit.
[14768.08s -> 14773.96s]  Like what the enemy champions do, what your champions need to do to win the game, what the win cons are.
[14774.96s -> 14776.96s]  You can just pick,
[14776.96s -> 14778.96s]  and I'm being honest though, you could just pick a...
[14781.28s -> 14784.48s]  Like there are 80 carries in the current meta where you can just pick that are blind.
[14784.48s -> 14786.48s]  Like I was making a tier list, I forgot about it.
[14786.88s -> 14789.64s]  But I mean you can blind pick Jynx pretty much every game.
[14790.88s -> 14795.08s]  Like Jinx is just blindable every game pretty much. She's insane. She's super OP
[14795.84s -> 14801.52s]  So like if you if you ever just want to play a champion and you think like okay, I want to practice AD like Jinx is insane super good
[14805.40s -> 14810.88s]  Draven's not blindable, but I do think he's really good if you're good at the game Draven's very good
[14811.80s -> 14815.40s]  He's he's he's harder than Jinx by a mile like Draven's a lot harder
[14815.68s -> 14819.50s]  But he's definitely like good at carrying with a lead as well
[14820.88s -> 14825.52s]  Like another blindable AD that I think is like A tier is like Varus.
[14825.52s -> 14830.84s]  You can blind pick Varus really easily because Varus doesn't really have counters.
[14830.84s -> 14832.96s]  Like he doesn't get countered by anything.
[14832.96s -> 14838.24s]  He's more of like a, you can pick him and then go even and your ulti will always be
[14838.24s -> 14839.24s]  useful.
[14839.24s -> 14840.60s]  You can look to like win lane.
[14840.60s -> 14847.12s]  You can look to like engage things like that, right?
[14847.12s -> 14872.80s]  Okay, so this game as the support I need to be tracking the jungler
[14872.80s -> 14880.48s]  So I'm gonna think we're always be thinking what the enemy jungler wants to accomplish and how to stop it
[14880.48s -> 14883.04s]  That's like a pretty big tip of advice. I can give you guys
[14884.88s -> 14889.64s]  Like think to yourself like okay if I was the enemy jungler, what would I be wanting to do against this Graves right as Lee Sin?
[14891.08s -> 14894.78s]  He's probably gonna want to either gank early like gank bot early or he wants to
[14897.56s -> 14902.60s]  Invade on certain timers right because that's like what Lee is really good at is ganking and invading
[14902.80s -> 14911.12s]  So what I think I'm going to try to do this game is I'm going to try and watch for early
[14911.12s -> 14914.64s]  ganks and early pressure bot lanes like level 2, level 3 ganks.
[14914.64s -> 14920.02s]  We're still going to be aggressive but Lux took TP which means this Lux does not plan
[14920.02s -> 14922.24s]  on playing aggressive at all.
[14922.24s -> 14927.44s]  Like she basically, if anybody takes TP like this in a lane, I already know from start
[14927.44s -> 14930.20s]  of the game that they're not planning on doing anything.
[14930.20s -> 14932.96s]  So I'm probably going to end up roaming a lot this game.
[14932.96s -> 14949.10s]  This is going to be a game where I roam a ton.
[14949.10s -> 14951.10s]  We do have some good ways to roam too, too.
[14951.10s -> 14969.50s]  top and med is both really good. I just want her to ward early because I don't want to
[14969.50s -> 14977.14s]  get shit on by way. So okay I'm just gonna flash immediately. There's no reason to not
[14977.14s -> 14983.06s]  flash there because Alistar used this flash to get my flash which is totally fine. It's better for
[14983.06s -> 14993.30s]  him because he has hex flash but it's not that bad because I can outrange him and I can stay away
[14993.30s -> 15002.10s]  from his his shit so we know he's in the bush we just chill there it is he fucked up now we go
[15002.10s -> 15007.40s]  forward I don't know why Lux isn't throwing spells at this guy like I don't
[15007.40s -> 15011.36s]  know why she didn't cue him like he fucked up the Alistar should have died
[15011.36s -> 15016.74s]  there and she's pinging me okay the Alistar should have died there if Alistar
[15016.74s -> 15020.88s]  ever fucks up on a gauge like that where he hex flashes in gets stuck like cue
[15020.88s -> 15023.92s]  his cooldown yeah I don't know why it was thrown is what I'm saying you don't
[15023.92s -> 15030.32s]  throw you don't throw spells that that aren't gonna land so there's no
[15030.32s -> 15034.40s]  No point in Lux ever throwing her Q until Alistar fucks up the combo.
[15034.40s -> 15039.08s]  Like she should just poke with E and then because it's almost like a Blitz hook, right?
[15039.08s -> 15040.64s]  Think of it like a Blitz hook.
[15040.64s -> 15043.64s]  If she throws the Q out, right?
[15043.64s -> 15049.16s]  Now they have an opportunity to be aggressive because they know the hook is down.
[15049.16s -> 15054.00s]  So it's better for her to just hold the hook essentially, right?
[15054.00s -> 15058.64s]  Hold the Q and now when Alistar does go in they have to be nervous about that
[15058.64s -> 15063.04s]  Q because they can't just think oh the Q's down let's let's engage right so
[15063.04s -> 15072.08s]  they can't actually think about that this is why I don't like a lot of the
[15072.08s -> 15079.48s]  time doing this like push push the wave they can't engage on us without like
[15079.48s -> 15083.08s]  flashing so it doesn't matter like luck
[15083.08s -> 15088.08s]  Did she queue the wave again? Or am I an idiot?
[15088.08s -> 15093.08s]  Like, just... oh man, I'm losing my mind here.
[15093.08s -> 15096.08s]  Aw, these... I'm tilting. It's fine.
[15096.08s -> 15100.08s]  I need to not tilt, I need to just chill, but I'm getting frustrated because we're like,
[15100.08s -> 15104.08s]  not using cooldowns properly and it's driving me fucking crazy.
[15107.08s -> 15110.08s]  Because these are very simple things to do.
[15110.08s -> 15112.76s]  You guys gotta walk the wave in, by the way. You can't let them freeze, okay.
[15113.52s -> 15116.36s]  They're very simple things to do. I know I'm being annoying as shit, whining about this,
[15116.36s -> 15119.64s]  but this is stuff that you need to be thinking about when you're playing the game.
[15120.20s -> 15121.80s]  Well, you should actively be thinking,
[15124.24s -> 15128.52s]  what can I do with my champion's toolkit to stop their champion's toolkit?
[15129.24s -> 15131.92s]  And you should be thinking, okay, I have Q, right?
[15132.68s -> 15135.80s]  So what do they want to do? They want to go in, okay?
[15136.24s -> 15138.32s]  And when you're thinking they want to go in,
[15140.98s -> 15146.64s]  Right you should be thinking okay when they go in I can just queue and that should be your entire thought process
[15147.48s -> 15149.48s]  Your thought process should never be oh
[15150.82s -> 15154.28s]  Maybe I can land a random queue at max range and we can get a kill
[15156.84s -> 15163.56s]  She queued the wave yes, that's what I mean like you should never queue the wave on Lux either unless you're going to 100% reset
[15163.56s -> 15171.48s]  That would be like if I hooked the wave as like Blitzcrank or some shit. Why is my locks bait-pinging my graves?
[15172.20s -> 15175.70s]  Dude, I gotta keep this a hundred percent honest to the men
[15177.50s -> 15184.02s]  You don't get you you don't get to be mad here. Why are dude these players are such babies
[15187.68s -> 15190.88s]  Jesus Christ what pussies men these people are such babies
[15193.56s -> 15196.08s]  The graves played correctly by the way like a hundred percent
[15197.28s -> 15199.48s]  The he's mad at the graves for taking a wave
[15199.72s -> 15202.88s]  He wanted to not like he wanted to be able to TP back and get the wave
[15203.20s -> 15211.00s]  That's what this locks is so trash that she actually believes that's the graves faults that graves misplayed by pushing the bot wave
[15211.56s -> 15213.56s]  But it was the right play
[15214.36s -> 15217.88s]  Pushing the bot wave was the correct play there because then she doesn't have to TP
[15218.08s -> 15220.68s]  The whole reason that he's pushing it is to save her teleport
[15221.12s -> 15223.12s]  So that she doesn't have to TP to lane
[15223.56s -> 15231.84s]  Players like this are why the game is hard to play right now in the current meta.
[15231.84s -> 15233.68s]  Why it feels bad.
[15233.68s -> 15235.40s]  Because this Lux is trash.
[15235.40s -> 15237.16s]  You guys can all see this Lux is terrible.
[15237.16s -> 15238.56s]  She's already made a bunch of mistakes.
[15238.56s -> 15239.88s]  She's blaming her team.
[15239.88s -> 15242.16s]  She's being a dipshit, right?
[15242.16s -> 15251.12s]  But she can climb up to this elo being this bad because of the system, the current
[15251.12s -> 15270.96s]  system in place okay we should immediately do Baron here dragon I mean we
[15270.96s -> 15280.56s]  should do this come you don't have time for this just come do dragon bro the
[15280.56s -> 15297.56s]  The leasing just showed top, we should be doing dragon.
[15297.56s -> 15302.48s]  When this shit happens by the way, where you have enemy jungler shows on one side of
[15302.48s -> 15306.92s]  the map, you should always be playing on the other side of the map to make a counter
[15306.92s -> 15308.48s]  play.
[15308.48s -> 15312.68s]  So jungler show is on top side, we go for dragon, right?
[15312.68s -> 15313.68s]  Easy.
[15317.68s -> 15318.88s]  Yo, be careful.
[15318.88s -> 15320.88s]  Alistar is going to be there, Zerath is going to be there.
[15320.88s -> 15321.88s]  Just leave.
[15321.88s -> 15322.88s]  Just leave.
[15322.88s -> 15325.38s]  Leave, leave, leave.
[15325.38s -> 15326.38s]  I'll do it for you.
[15326.38s -> 15327.38s]  I'll make you leave.
[15327.38s -> 15328.88s]  I got you, man.
[15328.88s -> 15334.88s]  But we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and I need a back now.
[15334.88s -> 15338.08s]  But we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back.
[15338.08s -> 15348.48s]  Not only did their bot lane have to back, but the enemy was top.
[15348.48s -> 15349.48s]  I tried, man.
[15349.48s -> 15354.80s]  I tried to flash, Q him.
[15354.80s -> 15356.48s]  But yeah, it's really, I don't know.
[15356.48s -> 15360.56s]  A lot of junglers don't, I don't think they know what their, oh I'm dead by the way.
[15360.56s -> 15364.20s]  I'm not even going to pop exhaust, I'm just dead.
[15364.20s -> 15368.46s]  A lot of junglers don't know what the goal of the game actually is.
[15368.46s -> 15371.20s]  A lot of them think that was a bad insect, but...
[15371.20s -> 15376.20s]  A lot of junglers think the goal of the game is to get as much farm as you can and run over the enemy team and shit.
[15376.20s -> 15377.30s]  But it's actually... it is.
[15377.30s -> 15384.30s]  But it's also about getting early objectives and turning those small leads into big leads through objective control.
[15384.30s -> 15386.70s]  Right?
[15386.70s -> 15389.00s]  So right now, I want to rotate top.
[15389.00s -> 15392.40s]  Rift is up. I know Lee Sin's going to be on top side of the map right now.
[15392.40s -> 15393.90s]  I want to rotate top.
[15393.90s -> 15397.50s]  so that I can help my team by being in the top side of the map
[15397.50s -> 15399.50s]  because that's where the next play is gonna be made.
[15403.82s -> 15406.32s]  Well the play is made mid, but I mean I'm here so it's fine.
[15413.42s -> 15414.42s]  Oh my god.
[15418.62s -> 15422.76s]  I did not think the fucking Lee Sin would be there too.
[15423.90s -> 15425.90s]  Oh
[15428.94s -> 15435.06s]  This is rough, I don't really know how to how to play this because I got there in time to counter the gank
[15435.86s -> 15441.26s]  right, I exhausted the guy saved the Zareth. I got there in time to counter the gank but
[15443.74s -> 15445.74s]  Ooh well played
[15446.74s -> 15449.22s]  That's actually mega well played
[15450.90s -> 15452.90s]  That was really good
[15453.90s -> 15456.22s]  I want to push this wave in but I can't
[15465.06s -> 15470.84s]  Like you guys are noticing there's no objectives taken on the map yet at 10 minutes, which is kind of crazy
[15471.50s -> 15475.38s]  The alley's doing really good. The house is not a bad support player. He's playing well
[15483.90s -> 15496.46s]  like he's playing very well a lot of this is more of like I need I don't have
[15496.46s -> 15500.82s]  anything to do on the map because I'm trying to help my jungler but my jungler
[15500.82s -> 15506.70s]  is trolling it's really rough because like I'm trying to rotate over and help
[15506.70s -> 15510.38s]  my jungler on cooldown basically right but my jungler doesn't want to fight
[15510.38s -> 15514.14s]  You see like I'm countering the Alistar's fight or ganks. It's just
[15520.82s -> 15522.82s]  I'm just dead
[15524.30s -> 15526.30s]  Dude
[15527.02s -> 15533.34s]  Like we shouldn't have made that play mid because we knew that they were all there and we knew that our jungler is doing this
[15534.74s -> 15537.02s]  This might just be a jungle diff honestly
[15537.02s -> 15542.74s]  Like our adc sucks, but it might just be a straight-up jungle diff game. They do happen
[15544.78s -> 15548.34s]  Especially in this illo where jungle has so much control of the game. They do happen
[15552.90s -> 15555.94s]  It's a pretty big jungle diff chip hoppy, you know it I know it
[15557.54s -> 15562.84s]  But yeah, he's saying yeah, like he knows the jungle is getting out outclassed insanely hard
[15562.84s -> 15571.80s]  Because Graves counters Lee Sin, it's a massive counter.
[15571.80s -> 15575.76s]  But this guy doesn't know what he's doing.
[15575.76s -> 15578.88s]  I think he's a Rengar one-trick and Rengar got banned.
[15578.88s -> 15581.52s]  I think that's what's going on.
[15581.52s -> 15585.52s]  It's a Rengar one-trick who got banned out and he tried to play a champion that requires
[15585.52s -> 15586.52s]  thought.
[15586.52s -> 15588.56s]  Not just a I jump you die champ.
[15588.56s -> 15589.56s]  Right?
[15589.56s -> 15591.56s]  And he just gets shit on for it.
[15596.70s -> 15599.66s]  I mean dude, I can't even do anything this game.
[15601.04s -> 15604.04s]  Our top laner is getting his ass whipped too. It's really fucking rough.
[15608.50s -> 15610.50s]  I mean, he's in here, I'm pretty sure.
[15611.20s -> 15613.20s]  It's not, it was just, it was warded though.
[15614.56s -> 15617.36s]  I mean, we can't really do anything here. I'm dead I think.
[15618.30s -> 15619.20s]  Yeah, I'm just dead.
[15620.28s -> 15624.38s]  This is just rough I I kind of want to go next because I don't think I
[15625.12s -> 15627.44s]  Don't think we have the skill on the team to win
[15629.20s -> 15634.28s]  The jungle depth is huge the 80 depth is huge and I'm just I can't I can't impact the map
[15634.28s -> 15651.32s]  Like I can't I just can't do anything this game to impact the map and it feels really bad
[15651.32s -> 15653.32s]  Oh
[15662.68s -> 15664.68s]  Son of a bitch I should have flashed I
[15667.68s -> 15671.20s]  Got like creep walked a little bit when he knocked me in I like had to walk through it should just flashed up
[15671.20s -> 15675.36s]  That's my man. Like what was that TP man? Oh God get me out
[15676.04s -> 15679.48s]  I'm gonna be a hundred percent real get me out that TP was miserably bad
[15680.24s -> 15682.24s]  Dude just tp'd to the wave
[15690.68s -> 15695.92s]  Like what is our blocks doing to like I just feel like everybody's late to the fights
[15697.60s -> 15699.60s]  Locks is always late to the fights
[15700.04s -> 15703.92s]  The graves doesn't want to take fights even though he's playing graves in the Lee Sin
[15704.64s -> 15707.64s]  Like I feel like oh, this is rough. This is a rough game
[15708.52s -> 15710.48s]  Games like this tilt me and I kind of just want to go next
[15711.40s -> 15715.80s]  Because games like this they are winnable, but I feel like I want to go next to save mental, you know
[15716.64s -> 15718.88s]  Like low-key. I just want to save my mental
[15728.84s -> 15730.84s]  Cuz oh, it's so gross
[15732.36s -> 15736.88s]  Like watching what Lux did in the early stages the lane phase just wasting her Q on repeat
[15736.88s -> 15741.68s]  That was one of the most embarrassing things ever and then like look at that. She just killed a minion
[15753.12s -> 15755.12s]  Oh
[15756.52s -> 15760.22s]  Bro like oh my god, you gotta push the wave man
[15764.04s -> 15766.04s]  Holy shits
[15766.88s -> 15770.36s]  I mean, I can't even walk oh
[15776.20s -> 15781.16s]  My god, I don't even have help from my fucking team
[15782.72s -> 15784.72s]  That's the worst part about this
[15788.40s -> 15791.60s]  Dude these games feel so unplayable man
[15791.60s -> 15797.20s]  Like I don't know how else to say it except for they just feel miserable to play
[15800.04s -> 15806.04s]  Like I'm trying to focus on playing like improving myself, but it's so hard to know how to improve in games where like
[15807.96s -> 15811.30s]  You genuinely just get no help
[15811.30s -> 15822.14s]  My Lux has been tilted since like minute two for some reason and my Graves has been completely
[15822.14s -> 15827.70s]  pathing wrong doing wrong shit. It's hard to know how to help like I went mid to help
[15827.70s -> 15834.58s]  countered two of the early ganks. Lux still griefed the game. So like yeah it's just
[15834.58s -> 15836.58s]  It's hard to know and then top lane lost
[15839.70s -> 15841.70s]  It's so rough man
[15845.86s -> 15851.70s]  Like I'm gonna keep it a hundred percent honest with you if you are a one-trick do not try and play other champs
[15853.18s -> 15855.18s]  You you will int
[15858.42s -> 15863.02s]  You will play badly always and you will int and you will you will
[15863.02s -> 15873.98s]  like look at this this is 2.9k damage as a dude like what are we doing how are
[15873.98s -> 15880.70s]  these people getting into this elo how does this locks like in the game she was
[15880.70s -> 15887.70s]  against an Alistar bot and she did 1.2.9k damage in a 16 minute game
[15887.70s -> 15896.48s]  against a melee heavy team like what is this what is happening this guy was d4
[15896.48s -> 15905.12s]  30 LP last season and now he's magically in masters
[15905.12s -> 15910.68s]  No, we need to fix matchmaking.
[15910.68s -> 15913.44s]  This is insane.
[15913.44s -> 15918.96s]  Like this is just a matchmaking diff.
[15918.96s -> 15920.84s]  It's nothing else.
[15920.84s -> 15927.60s]  My man literally does not belong in Master Tier 400LP MMR at all.
[15927.60s -> 15937.60s]  You can see that he's not at this level.
[15937.60s -> 15951.60s]  Dude, I have the Lux player on my team again.
[15951.60s -> 15962.02s]  There's a Zerath one trick and a Rengar one trick on the enemy team.
[15962.02s -> 15963.82s]  I don't know man.
[15963.82s -> 15970.74s]  I guess I care more about the Rengar than the Zerath, but this is rough.
[15981.60s -> 15987.50s]  Oh, what's up Tripopi dude? Sorry I hit yes on that man. I know the game was winnable
[15987.50s -> 15993.62s]  I'm gonna be real, but dude you didn't see what I saw during the early game of that game Tripopi like man
[15996.12s -> 15998.74s]  The entire early game of that game was like
[15999.36s -> 16007.76s]  We lost lane because Lux wouldn't use her Q to fight the Alistar. She was using it to farm minions
[16007.76s -> 16014.12s]  Like, she was so scared of being engaged on by the Alistar and the Callista that she would
[16014.12s -> 16020.44s]  use her Q to max-range farm minions instead of save it so when the Alistar engages we just
[16020.44s -> 16023.04s]  kill him, right?
[16023.04s -> 16026.60s]  Because if Alistar ever engages on me in Lux, he just gets killed.
[16026.60s -> 16030.36s]  We just bind him, walk away, and he's stuck there and he dies, right?
[16030.36s -> 16036.04s]  But for some reason, she didn't understand how to do that so she was just throwing
[16036.04s -> 16038.40s]  it to farm so we would just get engaged on.
[16038.40s -> 16043.08s]  So I started roaming and every time I was roaming to an objective or something, the Graves
[16043.08s -> 16046.32s]  would always walk away and not fight.
[16046.32s -> 16050.20s]  He wasn't attempting to fight, he was basically just like, oh I'm gonna go farm some more.
[16050.20s -> 16051.80s]  But I'm like dude, you can't do that.
[16051.80s -> 16055.68s]  If the Alistar is ganking mid and I'm countering mid, you can't just farm before coming
[16055.68s -> 16059.08s]  mid or you can't just not take dragon and shit like that, right?
[16059.08s -> 16062.56s]  It blows my mind that these players can get, it's like this guy too.
[16062.56s -> 16065.24s]  Same thing, like that jungler last game, right?
[16065.24s -> 16069.24s]  Look at this, it's the same thing as the last game, NA has riddled with this shit, it's
[16069.24s -> 16070.24s]  so miserable to play.
[16070.24s -> 16075.52s]  Look at this, this jungler last game, he's not a D1 player, he's not a bad player, he
[16075.52s -> 16078.64s]  peeps D1, but why is this guy in this game now?
[16078.64s -> 16083.28s]  He artificially inflated to the silo, getting lucky with his first few games, and now
[16083.28s -> 16084.72s]  we have to play with this guy.
[16084.72s -> 16089.20s]  Oh, it's an account share.
[16089.20s -> 16091.52s]  The person, it's a different player.
[16091.52s -> 16093.76s]  Look, on the account.
[16094.96s -> 16096.60s]  D flash, F flash.
[16098.52s -> 16101.30s]  So, it's a fucking account share.
[16103.20s -> 16104.60s]  That's frustrating.
[16112.18s -> 16113.64s]  Sorry for whining so much, guys.
[16113.64s -> 16115.84s]  This shit's just really frustrating to me.
[16116.80s -> 16117.92s]  Like, I know I should play it
[16117.92s -> 16122.16s]  like specifically only care about like improving and then while you're improving you'll climb
[16122.16s -> 16129.28s]  automatically and shit but it's really frustrating when like the players in the game would rather be
[16129.28s -> 16134.00s]  idiots and assholes to each other than play the game right like the game before the amumu right
[16134.00s -> 16138.16s]  the game before this the amumu was just being toxic the whole game and into the went away
[16138.16s -> 16141.76s]  the last game the lux and the graves were being toxic to each other the whole game
[16141.76s -> 16148.72s]  We entered the game away. It's like, it's not fun to lose because one player gets mad
[16148.72s -> 16156.96s]  at another player over them both being idiots. I'm sorry, it's not fun. It's so unfun.
[16158.40s -> 16161.44s]  But we'll try and win this one.
[16171.76s -> 16176.12s]  All we can really do is try and carry the games, right?
[16176.12s -> 16179.16s]  It's about it.
[16179.16s -> 16180.16s]  What is?
[16180.16s -> 16181.16s]  What?
[16181.16s -> 16182.16s]  What?
[16182.16s -> 16195.16s]  Man, what do you think they're going to do to me?
[16195.16s -> 16196.16s]  Welcome to the League of Dreams.
[16196.16s -> 16198.16s]  Yo, I've been thinking for the seven months, man.
[16198.16s -> 16199.16s]  Welcome back.
[16199.16s -> 16200.88s]  Like, I really don't want to mute all.
[16200.88s -> 16205.58s]  I don't I don't want to mute all because like I want to like value the penguins and shit, but dude
[16216.62s -> 16220.22s]  If they walk up I'm gonna flank them that's why I'm standing here
[16230.88s -> 16257.88s]  That was a big Q. I need to get level 2 first here, 100%
[16257.88s -> 16281.84s]  Ash should have just been autoing there that whole time because we have heal so she should
[16281.84s -> 16283.64s]  have just walked up and autoed.
[16283.64s -> 16286.56s]  As soon as, uh, this is what I mean by tracking cooldowns,
[16286.56s -> 16289.00s]  as soon as the Niko missed her,
[16289.00s -> 16291.12s]  as soon as the Niko missed her cooldown,
[16291.12s -> 16292.72s]  as soon as she missed her E,
[16292.72s -> 16295.84s]  the Ashe just walked up and immediately started fighting.
[16297.20s -> 16299.56s]  Right, like, because they can no longer kill us.
[16301.16s -> 16303.40s]  The, uh, Niko doesn't actually have spells
[16303.40s -> 16305.20s]  outside of her E, right?
[16305.20s -> 16308.12s]  So she misses that snare and she used her W too, right?
[16308.12s -> 16310.28s]  So it's like, we just go ham.
[16310.28s -> 16311.88s]  You don't need to be too scared.
[16313.64s -> 16317.26s]  It happens quite a bit sometimes where people will just be like really nervous
[16322.12s -> 16324.12s]  It's fun
[16335.04s -> 16338.66s]  Damn if I had dodged that Q I actually would have killed all three
[16338.66s -> 16344.26s]  Damn. I don't know if it was worth the flash after the guy. I think it was. If I had dodged
[16344.26s -> 16351.34s]  the Q, I would have been fine. It's whatever. It also doesn't miss any creeps here. So it's
[16351.34s -> 16359.30s]  not the end of the world. I'm pretty sure Lee Sin did not have his top camps by the
[16359.30s -> 16374.70s]  way. Damn, if I was a little better mechanically, I turned that by the way. 100%. We should push
[16374.70s -> 16399.68s]  this wave so that I can go get vision because yeah that guy can't freeze that
[16399.68s -> 16426.68s]  wave so it's not too bad we since top you can kind of see some really good
[16426.68s -> 16434.56s]  What is this why's my cart this AFK turret
[16439.00s -> 16441.00s]  What is happening right now
[16453.62s -> 16455.62s]  Why was he AFK
[16456.68s -> 16470.32s]  I mean, I guess it worked out, but yeah, maybe you had to go let his cat out and I don't know
[16470.32s -> 16473.16s]  Happens
[16473.16s -> 16485.00s]  We do their ball lanes not very good. They're trying too hard to force fights that they
[16485.00s -> 16494.28s]  win. Like they genuinely can't win half these fights that they're trying to force. Maybe if
[16494.28s -> 16497.72s]  they were against people who like don't push their buttons they could win those but it's like
[16497.72s -> 16502.28s]  all I have to do is stand there and fight back and they lose. They're on dragon a thousand percent
[16502.28s -> 16507.88s]  right now. There's not a lot I can do about that. We just have to chill. There's almost
[16507.88s -> 16512.44s]  Nothing I can do about it Kai says trying to fake act like she's big, but it's just
[16515.76s -> 16517.76s]  There's just nothing we can do
[16519.24s -> 16521.86s]  Cuz our car this is top so we just chill
[16526.44s -> 16529.20s]  They finish the chairless no not yet
[16533.84s -> 16535.84s]  Leason could be bought right now
[16535.84s -> 16541.94s]  Mmm, I don't think it's too bad if he's bought though. They can't really dive us especially with card assaults
[16556.98s -> 16559.12s]  Why why does my ash just run?
[16559.12s -> 16567.72s]  She like just straight up runs away. It's kind of silly
[16576.82s -> 16581.84s]  Because we have we have Carthus ulti like we can win that five or we can win a fight bot right now I
[16585.44s -> 16588.78s]  Guess I guess I'm just gonna have to get them low enough for Carthus to kill them
[16589.12s -> 16595.40s]  Like without the ashes help, which I think I can do it's not too bad
[16597.56s -> 16602.52s]  Okay, the Akali's coming bought we just killed them. I mean let's just fight I
[16610.72s -> 16615.78s]  Don't know why we just ash arrow honestly just ash arrow
[16619.12s -> 16623.20s]  Okay, that was pretty bad ash arrow, but
[16630.52s -> 16638.64s]  Filled I think he's filled I think he's just having a bad game. I got it happens, you know, whoa, okay
[16642.48s -> 16644.64s]  Do it ult me I fucking dare you
[16649.12s -> 16652.78s]  I'm trying to keep some mana so that I can ulti
[16666.88s -> 16668.88s]  Oh, Karthus already used his ult, fuck
[16675.18s -> 16677.36s]  They both backed there, wow
[16679.12s -> 16684.20s]  My bad, I honestly didn't think they were both gonna back there
[16686.68s -> 16693.76s]  Like I thought the kaisa was gonna back right where I saw her like lasts that was my bed hmm. I should be I
[16694.84s -> 16696.84s]  Think we sin can come bot here and kill me. I
[16699.88s -> 16701.88s]  Should actually stop this guy's back
[16701.88s -> 16712.36s]  Yeah, I should stop his back because it's more value to stop the back now even if Lee Sin isn't but it's more value
[16713.56s -> 16715.56s]  Because he's so low
[16716.40s -> 16718.96s]  Collie is Mia though, so we got to be care I
[16720.68s -> 16726.92s]  Wasted my ult though, which makes me kind of scared the other thing that kind of sucks about this is we don't have good vision
[16731.88s -> 16737.44s]  And I can't really help anybody on the map because the same thing is happening as before
[16738.52s -> 16741.56s]  We're like we're missing opportunities to get kills on timers
[16744.72s -> 16746.86s]  I mean the dog lighting guy's playing fine this game
[16746.86s -> 16751.08s]  I think he's trolled a lot like he's he's trolling. This isn't like his best game
[16752.24s -> 16756.36s]  But it's also I don't know why we're getting so tilted around the map right now
[16757.00s -> 16759.94s]  Because if I'm if I'm being honest, we should just win the game off of like
[16759.94s -> 16781.06s]  being better players I don't know what this car this is thinking but do it do it
[16781.06s -> 16791.34s]  it. Guard this, we can fight, we can fight, just fight. Bro, what are we doing? I'm losing
[16791.34s -> 16797.34s]  it man. Ah, no no no, I'm tilted. I'm tilted as fuck. He didn't walk in- just go onto the
[16797.34s -> 16805.06s]  Akali Shroud man. Well, just walk a foot to your right and stand on the Akali Shroud.
[16805.06s -> 16807.94s]  She just eats your damage while she's in the shroud.
[16807.94s -> 16809.26s]  She can't stop that.
[16809.26s -> 16817.22s]  Holy shit, I'm losing my minds.
[16817.22s -> 16822.66s]  Ashe is just inting bot waves right now, not trying to do anything.
[16822.66s -> 16829.30s]  Lux is really far up on CS, which is really good, but I'm losing it, man.
[16829.30s -> 16831.94s]  We see exactly where they are every game.
[16831.94s -> 16837.06s]  We see where everybody is on the enemy team permanently and we still can't manage to like walk to the right location
[16837.82s -> 16839.82s]  This is driving me crazy
[16841.74s -> 16846.24s]  My my Carthus 80 my Carthus jungles getting out farmed
[16846.88s -> 16850.70s]  Like a Carthus jungles getting out farmed by a Lee Sin jungle. That's insane
[16851.66s -> 16854.74s]  Like I don't think I don't think I can stress enough how crazy that is
[16857.46s -> 16860.46s]  Like there should never be a world where Carthus ever gets out farms
[16861.94s -> 16872.16s]  no way I'm dead dude no way I just fucking ate the end of that now I'm
[16872.16s -> 16876.60s]  playing that just kill the Lee Sin man
[16883.60s -> 16890.40s]  I fucked up there that was my fault cuz I got hit by the tip of the that was
[16890.40s -> 16893.74s]  my fault. I got barely clipped by the tip of the Neeko ult when I was trying to space
[16893.74s -> 16898.36s]  because I'm bad. And if I was alive there and I could have saved my flash for the Lee Sin
[16898.36s -> 16906.04s]  Q, we just win. I am confused at why we decided to like not fight that immediately though.
[16906.04s -> 16910.34s]  Like we caught out two of their members and we just got scared for whatever reason.
[16910.34s -> 16917.34s]  Wait we win this, fight. We 1000% win this, fight this, fight this, fight this.
[16920.40s -> 16932.34s]  Bro, do not throw a fucking temper tantrum right now.
[16932.34s -> 16933.34s]  Just one kill?
[16933.34s -> 16938.40s]  Do not throw a temper tantrum.
[16938.40s -> 16940.76s]  Oh my god, here we go.
[16940.76s -> 16941.76s]  I took one kill.
[16941.76s -> 16957.28s]  about to lose his mind guys. I need to mute all. I'm gonna mute all in a second. Like I can't
[16957.28s -> 16965.48s]  with these people right now. Like I can't man. You people are disgusting. Like you guys
[16965.48s -> 16971.40s]  It's just wine. You play bad, you whine and you bitch about every little mistake that everything happens
[16971.40s -> 16973.16s]  Even though it's like in the middle of a fight
[16973.16s -> 16978.56s]  I guarantee I'm a better player than you are and you're still whining and crying over one shutdown that like
[16979.08s -> 16985.28s]  You didn't even walk to until I spam pinged you like I literally 1v2ed them you hit 1e and now you're mad
[16988.08s -> 16990.96s]  Dude I swear league players are fucking psychopaths
[16995.48s -> 17002.16s]  At least I got the exhaust off surely she dies right surely she dies here or not, okay
[17003.36s -> 17005.36s]  Okay, at least she died
[17005.96s -> 17007.96s]  Help each other guys
[17008.56s -> 17010.56s]  Help each other teamwork
[17012.44s -> 17014.44s]  Teamwork teamwork teamwork teamwork
[17019.48s -> 17021.48s]  Wait this ash is insane
[17025.48s -> 17031.04s]  Okay, I'm not gonna lie that ash played that so good. I only saw the end of it and she still played that good
[17032.44s -> 17034.44s]  That was sick
[17034.88s -> 17037.28s]  Well, well done. That was actually really good
[17039.84s -> 17042.96s]  She almost stopped the dive that's crazy
[17047.48s -> 17052.44s]  This game is definitely 1,000% still winnable though we just have to play
[17052.44s -> 17059.42s]  Or late game and not lose our fucking minds. I'll let that push back into my ash. I'll go mid and get some vision
[17062.22s -> 17066.50s]  That's pretty much all we have to do play for late and not lose our mind early
[17071.78s -> 17078.34s]  We could play to kill this Akali right now, she doesn't know there's no ward here we could also invade here
[17078.34s -> 17091.70s]  oh that's so unlucky that was such a close queue kill that guy
[17108.34s -> 17115.34s]  Jesus Christ.
[17115.34s -> 17122.26s]  I feel like we should have won that fight.
[17122.26s -> 17125.22s]  I feel like something awkward happened and we lost.
[17125.22s -> 17129.26s]  Did my Ash just walk directly into the Sikale and not use her ulti?
[17129.26s -> 17130.26s]  Use your ulti.
[17130.26s -> 17131.26s]  You have ulti.
[17131.26s -> 17132.26s]  Use your ulti.
[17132.26s -> 17133.26s]  Oh, oh my God.
[17133.26s -> 17152.12s]  god what the fuck oh my god I don't even know what to say right now this is
[17152.12s -> 17156.96s]  insane this genuinely feels like everybody in the game is losing their
[17156.96s -> 17161.24s]  mind in the freest game I've ever seen in my life
[17163.26s -> 17168.48s]  like that's what we're losing to right there that guy the guy who like doesn't
[17168.48s -> 17173.28s]  understand how Senna works like that player that's why I'm frustrated like
[17173.28s -> 17179.88s]  that player right there has no idea how Senna works tries to fight me and we're
[17179.88s -> 17183.92s]  like losing to that guy like I'm trying really hard not to be an asshole but
[17183.92s -> 17190.68s]  like it's flooding out right now from these games it's crazy
[17190.68s -> 17200.76s]  like he's so toxic look at this he went proto belt I only a boot Nico but like
[17200.76s -> 17205.24s]  what that doesn't do anything to help his team
[17205.24s -> 17232.24s]  You could arrow that guy. I mean it's not impossible. Or don't. That's fine.
[17232.24s -> 17249.52s]  oh my god guys I think my luck since afk she's been sitting in base for like
[17249.52s -> 17259.92s]  five minutes I think she's like it literally just throwing there some
[17259.92s -> 17273.64s]  Alright, let's push this wave.
[17273.64s -> 17278.72s]  We could make a pick right now.
[17278.72s -> 17281.92s]  Jax, what are you doing, man?
[17281.92s -> 17282.92s]  Why are you up there?
[17282.92s -> 17283.92s]  Oh no.
[17283.92s -> 17290.92s]  Also, why does this Ash have the worst build I've ever seen?
[17290.92s -> 17303.92s]  Dude, if we lose to the Kaisa that just did that, I'm gonna lose my mind.
[17303.92s -> 17320.28s]  That guy just blind art in without any vision of anybody and just died there's just no way
[17320.28s -> 17324.72s]  we can lose this.
[17324.72s -> 17331.56s]  We got this guys just play like I just need to I need help getting vision control on
[17331.56s -> 17338.04s]  baron and mid and then we can we can win we got this
[17338.04s -> 17340.84s]  jesus christ
[17361.56s -> 17379.24s]  On the way down refresh so you're on
[17379.24s -> 17384.12s]  the right now
[17384.12s -> 17389.62s]  right now
[17389.62s -> 17393.62s]  I can't remember my nightmares. Wish I could remember to dream.
[17416.62s -> 17418.62s]  I mean we still got Baron, but he did get two of them I guess.
[17419.62s -> 17426.42s]  Oh, no, we only yeah, you got a card this an ash, but we did get Baron which is very nice
[17433.42s -> 17440.68s]  I'm gonna go Dom's this game normally go black Cleaver, but I think I'm gonna go Dom's
[17449.62s -> 17470.82s]  I need to get vision control on dragon and mid.
[17470.82s -> 17473.58s]  I need to get vision control and I need help to do it though.
[17474.38s -> 17476.38s]  I'm gonna act like I'm backing here
[17483.66s -> 17486.62s]  We should just be pushing mid with Baron, I don't know what we're doing
[17488.10s -> 17491.34s]  Like like low key it should just be straight up like we go mid with Baron here
[17491.34s -> 17505.02s]  What the fuck was that? That was a terrible play.
[17521.34s -> 17525.86s]  guys just just come in we have Baron
[17533.50s -> 17540.54s]  nice huge pick push mid push mid fuck dragon just push mid
[17540.54s -> 17548.54s]  Okay, now we back off.
[17548.54s -> 17555.74s]  Oh, I mean that was bad.
[17555.74s -> 17560.34s]  Guys, back off, back off, back off, leave.
[17560.34s -> 17561.86s]  Leave, leave, leave, please.
[17561.86s -> 17564.34s]  Please just leave.
[17564.34s -> 17568.22s]  Guys, you can leave, you can leave.
[17568.22s -> 17570.22s]  We just go do dragon.
[17570.22s -> 17575.90s]  We still have so much gold to get on the map. We can go get bot tier 2
[17576.64s -> 17578.64s]  Bot tier 1 bot tier 2
[17578.98s -> 17583.26s]  We have we have so much gold to get on the map. It's not a big deal right like we don't need to end the game right this second
[17583.78s -> 17585.78s]  We actually have Carthus and we have
[17587.58s -> 17589.74s]  Jax too, so like our scaling is really good
[17600.22s -> 17628.22s]  I need to go get it.
[17628.22s -> 17639.06s]  I need to go get my next item, but I need enough gold to do it.
[17639.06s -> 17641.26s]  I also need to go get wards.
[17641.26s -> 17642.26s]  This sucks.
[17642.26s -> 17645.66s]  I'm on like a weird buy timer where I don't have enough things to get.
[17645.66s -> 17646.66s]  You know what?
[17646.66s -> 17647.66s]  I'm just going to get my ward item.
[17647.66s -> 17650.94s]  I'm going to grab this for right now just so we can actually get some power on the
[17650.94s -> 17651.94s]  map.
[17651.94s -> 17655.54s]  Because the map is so dark and I think getting the ward item before finishing my last
[17655.54s -> 17664.82s]  items probably the smartest call. I am a little concerned why we're not pushing
[17664.82s -> 17671.54s]  bot with Jax, we're pushing top and I'm also concerned why we're not playing
[17671.54s -> 17677.50s]  for mid Pryo and we're just farming bot side. This is such an awkward fucking
[17677.50s -> 17687.94s]  thing. Like we should just be playing for mid Pryo and use arrow to engage. That's how
[17687.94s -> 17699.78s]  we win. We just use arrow to engage when they contest mid. It's actually that easy.
[17699.78s -> 17701.38s]  Like lowkey it's actually that easy.
[17708.34s -> 17709.84s]  See? Watch, now this guy's dead.
[17717.84s -> 17719.14s]  I mean that's fine with me.
[17720.64s -> 17721.72s]  You guys want to int to kill me?
[17721.72s -> 17722.82s]  That's totally fine.
[17729.78s -> 17743.86s]  They can get the inhib and then they can back up yeah, yeah getting hit back up and then play for play for baron
[17746.58s -> 17751.24s]  They'll only have a few seconds to do this though, so it's kind of scary because these two are gonna be alive
[17757.22s -> 17759.22s]  They need to back immediately
[17759.78s -> 17767.46s]  Just reset. You don't need the wave. Just leave, leave, leave, leave. Baron's up, Baron's
[17767.46s -> 17774.52s]  up. Think about the macro guys, the macro. We play for Baron now. Because there's a
[17774.52s -> 17778.44s]  timer now where like you guys just need to reset. Because there's a timer where the
[17778.44s -> 17786.30s]  enemy has tempo on the map. And if we don't, uh, if we don't allow, if we don't
[17786.30s -> 17798.90s]  reset they'll just rush Baron and there's nothing we can do about it okay
[17798.90s -> 17802.46s]  they're not on Baron I think they missed their timer they're on it no they're
[17802.46s -> 17813.62s]  on it they're on it they're on it okay they're not on it we're fun we can still
[17813.62s -> 17815.62s]  I'll fight this though, but we need everybody here.
[17822.46s -> 17825.38s]  Just arrow, arrow, Ash, arrow, arrow.
[17825.38s -> 17827.94s]  Arrow, it doesn't matter if you hit mouth, just arrow.
[17827.94s -> 17829.54s]  Just arrow him.
[17829.54s -> 17830.38s]  Thank you.
[17836.42s -> 17838.62s]  No, no, guys, the back line, the back line.
[17841.30s -> 17842.54s]  Play together, play together.
[17842.54s -> 17843.38s]  Yes!
[17845.50s -> 17846.58s]  Nice!
[17849.10s -> 17849.94s]  End of the game.
[17852.50s -> 17853.58s]  You end, you end here.
[17854.82s -> 17856.66s]  Lux, don't back.
[17856.66s -> 17857.86s]  You are giving me cancer.
[17857.86s -> 17859.06s]  Okay, they forfeit it.
[17859.06s -> 17861.06s]  Dude, look how easy that is.
[17861.06s -> 17862.86s]  Look how easy it is to win games
[17862.86s -> 17864.86s]  when people are listening to macro.
[17864.86s -> 17866.10s]  Look how easy it is.
[17866.10s -> 17867.74s]  Oh my God!
[17869.30s -> 17870.30s]  I'm losing it, man.
[17870.30s -> 17872.02s]  I swear to God, I'm losing my,
[17872.02s -> 17873.64s]  I can feel my hair falling out right now.
[17873.64s -> 17876.16s]  I can feel it falling out of my fucking head.
[17876.16s -> 17877.92s]  Like, I just lost the one that's right there.
[17877.92s -> 17882.40s]  Like, it's just fucking kill me, man.
[17882.40s -> 17883.36s]  In game.
[17883.36s -> 17885.96s]  God, it's so hard.
[17885.96s -> 17888.60s]  I feel so exhausted.
[17888.60s -> 17890.42s]  Like, it's so exhausting.
[17895.20s -> 17896.56s]  You played a 44 minute gold game?
[17896.56s -> 17898.10s]  God, damn.
[17898.98s -> 17899.98s]  That's impressive.
[17902.02s -> 17908.52s]  I don't want to honor any of these people. Who would you guys honor like out of all of them?
[17908.52s -> 17912.76s]  Who'd you guys pick cuz I I don't know they also in my eyes. I'm too toxic right now. They all suck
[17916.02s -> 17918.02s]  Jax I'll give it to Jax
[17919.78s -> 17922.94s]  Ash Ash was trying I'll give you that ash was trying
[17926.54s -> 17928.54s]  Dude look at this Lux
[17928.54s -> 17932.54s]  This luck's got so fucking carried. Oh my god.
[17937.54s -> 17939.54s]  Oh my god.
[17940.54s -> 17944.54s]  Don't type to me, you pedestrian.
[17948.54s -> 17951.54s]  This man called him a pedestrian.
[17958.54s -> 17961.54s]  That's not even an insult!
[17961.54s -> 17966.54s]  Like, oh yeah, yeah, wow, fucking pedestrian, like...
[17969.54s -> 17972.54s]  That's not even an insult, man!
[17972.54s -> 17993.50s]  Dude, guys, I feel like part of my life gets taken away, you know?
[17993.50s -> 17998.34s]  Like, when I play on my main account and I'm like super sweaty, tryharding and shit,
[17998.34s -> 18002.18s]  I feel like I'm losing, like, yeah, it's like, it's like, every time I lose, it's
[18002.18s -> 18006.78s]  like one hair or like every time I'm like barely win right it's just like every game in this
[18006.78s -> 18011.58s]  he was like one hair on my head gets fucking burnt out and just leaves and I'm not gonna
[18011.58s -> 18013.58s]  I'm gonna be looking like Homer Simpson.
[18032.58s -> 18038.58s]  Like, look at the difference in Ward's place. This is what annoys me about bad support players.
[18038.58s -> 18040.58s]  This guy placed 23.
[18041.06s -> 18044.92s]  He's more focused on getting kills than placing wards and it's really stupid
[18050.88s -> 18052.42s]  Sorry, I just don't listen
[18052.42s -> 18057.82s]  I don't have anything against the dog lightning guy as a person other than like what I've seen on his stream, right?
[18058.14s -> 18061.72s]  Like on his stream. He just seems really egotistical
[18062.90s -> 18068.56s]  Like he's like everything I hate in the average league player. He's really he has a massive ego
[18068.56s -> 18073.38s]  because he reached challenger on the support roll on like an off meta pick
[18073.38s -> 18076.72s]  like last year at some point or something or maybe he's challenger right now I
[18076.72s -> 18081.16s]  don't even know maybe he has an account in challenger I don't even know but it
[18081.16s -> 18087.96s]  drives me crazy because like he doesn't do anything correctly like he gets away
[18087.96s -> 18092.86s]  with such dumb shit because he like he like basically wins lane because he
[18092.86s -> 18097.48s]  plays extremely aggressively but if you guys noticed in that game the reason
[18097.48s -> 18102.44s]  we won lane or where we were able to push back is because they played aggressively but they did it
[18102.84s -> 18106.44s]  Really stupidly like they were fighting us in our own waves
[18107.24s -> 18109.72s]  Right like on repeat. They were just fighting us in our own waves
[18110.12s -> 18113.72s]  Every time I would just turn a one for one almost a one for two every time
[18114.28s -> 18117.64s]  And it's it's stupid because every time that's happening. They're also giving me souls, right?
[18117.96s -> 18122.04s]  And he would like take weird fights and like I know he's probably forth-bunning. He doesn't care
[18122.20s -> 18126.12s]  It's a smurf blah blah blah, but I just don't like when people like that like ego their ass off
[18126.12s -> 18135.52s]  stuff when they play so badly. It drives me crazy.
[18135.52s -> 18138.64s]  Why do I care so much? I don't know. I don't know.
[18156.12s -> 18163.20s]  How are you guys doing by the way, how's everybody's day going in chat?
[18163.20s -> 18165.28s]  What you guys up to talk to me?
[18165.28s -> 18169.04s]  I know I stopped like teaching the game and started whining like I got on my main account
[18169.04s -> 18178.60s]  a few hours ago and I stopped teaching and I started whining a bunch so my bad.
[18178.60s -> 18180.48s]  My bad on that one dudes.
[18180.48s -> 18202.24s]  How's everybody's day gone?
[18210.48s -> 18214.06s]  Suck me in bronze, you don't get enough time to actually improve.
[18214.06s -> 18215.22s]  Dude I feel that man.
[18215.22s -> 18216.22s]  It takes a long time.
[18216.22s -> 18220.10s]  League is not an easy game to pick up and start playing, right?
[18220.10s -> 18222.84s]  Like if you're in bronze or silver and you're like, oh I actually, you know, I'm having
[18222.84s -> 18226.42s]  fun playing the game, I kind of want to try and get better, it's, you're just overwhelmed
[18226.42s -> 18230.58s]  with so much info that you like have to play so many games, right?
[18230.58s -> 18233.70s]  Like I feel you man.
[18233.70s -> 18238.54s]  Like it's overwhelming.
[18238.54s -> 18247.26s]  Yeah, I I feel you
[18255.82s -> 18260.18s]  Well, we got men, okay, uh shall I just play trust
[18262.70s -> 18268.50s]  Well, I'm worried if I picked trust that we won't have AP but I also think I'm better at trust
[18268.54s -> 18274.70s]  than I am at like other stuff. So I don't know.
[18279.82s -> 18284.54s]  AP Varus? I'm not good enough at AP Varus, man. I'm gonna be real.
[18287.58s -> 18291.18s]  Well, my mouse is good, but the problem with mouse is like mouse is a shitty champion.
[18291.18s -> 18298.26s]  like Miles is trash right so like he's good but he's like not good in the sense
[18298.26s -> 18302.66s]  of like I can play him well but at the end of the day if they pick something
[18302.66s -> 18307.98s]  that like counters Miles I just lose
[18308.22s -> 18314.40s]  whereas like Tristana is just free to pick like even if we play all AD right
[18314.40s -> 18317.46s]  let's say we do all AD or some shit like on accidents or because people are
[18317.46s -> 18324.10s]  One Treks blah blah blah. It's it's still free like Tristan is still like a good pick because even with all ad
[18324.10s -> 18326.10s]  She's still like you can build Lord Dom's
[18326.66s -> 18331.48s]  She has incredibly high pressure early game if you play her right right like you could push the waves Rome
[18332.10s -> 18337.18s]  You can you can roam top room bot help lanes out like level 2 3 you can invade junglers early
[18337.38s -> 18339.38s]  Like she's just incredibly incredibly strong
[18341.38s -> 18343.38s]  This guy should go pike I
[18343.94s -> 18346.98s]  Was gonna say they picked new new and I picked an 80 mid
[18347.46s -> 18352.46s]  They picked Nunu and Thresh, we should have an engage.
[18352.46s -> 18356.62s]  Because Pike, Trist, I can just walk bot on repeat now
[18356.62s -> 18357.90s]  and pretty much kill people.
[18368.02s -> 18369.02s]  Watch an iron game.
[18369.02s -> 18370.06s]  Watching an iron game,
[18370.06s -> 18371.78s]  I feel like it wouldn't be an actual iron game though,
[18371.78s -> 18372.62s]  would it?
[18372.62s -> 18379.06s]  I've heard I had friends who like intentionally lost a bunch of games
[18380.38s -> 18381.90s]  and
[18381.90s -> 18387.82s]  So they could get to iron four right they like they like into down to iron four or whatever to see if they could make it and
[18391.34s -> 18394.02s]  There's just so many like smurfs in iron
[18395.98s -> 18398.90s]  There's like legitimate bot bot accounts
[18398.90s -> 18407.06s]  Like like accounts that are like being bodied right there's like bought of the counts and iron there's like Smurfs all over the place
[18415.50s -> 18419.98s]  It seems to have stopped I wonder if riot like did something that stopped the bots
[18421.40s -> 18425.56s]  They must they may have like they may have just think incorporated something that like stops the software
[18428.90s -> 18433.90s]  but I don't know I haven't heard anything about it but I have no clue
[18433.90s -> 18437.74s]  I'll be real I don't know
[18459.70s -> 18461.86s]  You had to take fall you around last game I got boots one
[18463.50s -> 18465.50s]  Dude that sounds awful I
[18468.90s -> 18472.70s]  Kind of feel bad for actual iron players who are like
[18474.02s -> 18478.34s]  In iron trying to climb because like that sounds bad
[18488.90s -> 18496.96s]  I do think you can climb obviously out of any elo it doesn't matter right like if I were to go into an iron game
[18496.96s -> 18498.96s]  I'd probably drop like 50 kills
[18500.60s -> 18504.72s]  But I so I do think you can climb out of any you know any elo for sure
[18518.90s -> 18523.70s]  I love a new account if you guys got a bot account that answered every time I wrote bot
[18530.58s -> 18532.58s]  That's funny
[18539.46s -> 18541.46s]  Yeah, I assume that's a good point
[18541.46s -> 18544.88s]  I guess if you're in iron you could like play to learn the game a bit better
[18544.88s -> 18547.10s]  And then you could like play a new account and see where you got
[18547.10s -> 18550.14s]  But yeah, I know that would work.
[18550.14s -> 18553.14s]  That makes sense.
[18553.14s -> 18559.14s]  Sure, I'll first pick, man.
[18559.14s -> 18563.10s]  I'll first pick Senna.
[18563.10s -> 18566.70s]  I guarantee they walk in fucking...
[18566.70s -> 18570.10s]  These people are gonna walk in fucking Nautilus or some shits.
[18570.10s -> 18573.14s]  It'll be like Jarvan, Nautilus.
[18573.14s -> 18579.38s]  I don't even know.
[18579.38s -> 18585.98s]  Riven's not too bad for Senna, it's okay to get flanked.
[18585.98s -> 18588.18s]  I actually don't think Riven's too bad right now.
[18588.18s -> 18591.26s]  Maybe all the Riven players I've played against suck, but I don't think she's actually that
[18591.26s -> 18592.26s]  bad.
[18592.26s -> 18595.06s]  I think Riven's like just, you have to position well.
[18595.06s -> 18598.86s]  I think Riven's really broken at abusing positioning.
[18598.86s -> 18601.02s]  That's why she's so good in solo queue.
[18601.02s -> 18606.58s]  good Riven players will get really gross flanks and the flanks are what's OP. Yeah, there's
[18606.58s -> 18611.98s]  the Gragas, okay. I was like, they're gonna pick something to fuck me over. This guy picked
[18611.98s -> 18617.58s]  Gragas, but it was gonna be like J4 or Gragas or something. And then this guy is the support,
[18617.58s -> 18623.62s]  he'll probably pick Nautilus. Unless he's a one trick, right? Like unless this guy
[18623.62s -> 18629.66s]  is straight up just like a one trick, he'll pick like Nautilus or some shits.
[18629.66s -> 18635.64s]  Recon, Recon or Nautilus?
[18635.64s -> 18642.10s]  Because if you pick some Enchanter, we just win the game.
[18642.10s -> 18647.86s]  He has to pick Engage.
[18647.86s -> 18651.30s]  Milio would be really good here too, actually.
[18651.30s -> 18653.78s]  Because Milio would counter half our team.
[18653.78s -> 18657.38s]  You can Milio Q, Wukong, and Kennen Engage.
[18658.38s -> 18661.12s]  Like if this guy played Mirio, this would actually be a hard land
[18663.42s -> 18665.42s]  Tom kinsh
[18668.10s -> 18670.86s]  I mean I I get it, but I think it's bad
[18672.70s -> 18674.70s]  Runes oh shit
[18675.18s -> 18679.86s]  Yo, you just saved me looking like an absolute fool. Thank you
[18681.34s -> 18684.74s]  Holy crap if you wanted to see my runes there here, but thank you you reminded me
[18684.74s -> 18688.10s]  I'm going to be over here. I'm going to get some water. I'll be right back. Get some
[18688.10s -> 18690.10s]  water
[18718.10s -> 18735.14s]  By the way, the people who are here to watch me play AD Carry, I sincerely apologize.
[18735.14s -> 18739.94s]  I know watching me play Senna is probably boring as fuck.
[18739.94s -> 18743.26s]  Okay.
[18743.26s -> 18744.26s]  I know.
[18744.26s -> 18750.42s]  And I promise you we will play AD carry at some point. I promise you I played
[18750.42s -> 18754.02s]  like the first four hours of the stream was AD carry or the first three right I
[18754.02s -> 18756.46s]  played on my smurf for a few games and played some AD so if you want to watch
[18756.46s -> 18761.86s]  that you can go back in the bottom we did some my commentary and shit the only
[18761.86s -> 18765.98s]  reason I'm playing so much Senna and support on this account is because like
[18765.98s -> 18770.72s]  there the elo I'm currently in is like the worst elo to climb in solo queue
[18770.72s -> 18776.92s]  because of a lot of factors and support has some of the highest impact on the
[18776.92s -> 18783.20s]  game. Whereas like ADK has high impact late but in solo queue you want to have
[18783.20s -> 18789.84s]  high impact early and I wanted to be able to impact the game really early on.
[18800.72s -> 18820.84s]  So yeah, sorry about being, you know, boring and shit.
[18820.84s -> 18825.48s]  I just really want to like win games at least on this account.
[18825.48s -> 18829.96s]  I want to get out of the silo because the faster I get out of the silo, the faster
[18829.96s -> 18846.80s]  um the faster I get out of the zero the faster I can have fun playing adc and
[18846.80s -> 18854.04s]  like trancon what a weird like what a weird play by these guys what the fuck
[18854.04s -> 18861.24s]  They like half shoved the waves to get like early bush control and then they
[18861.24s -> 18864.24s]  did shit like that.
[18871.56s -> 18875.96s]  This guy's just dead. I'm gonna give it to Twitch.
[18877.76s -> 18882.80s]  Nice we got his exhaust. So I wasted my exhaust there. I did it because I
[18882.80s -> 18887.88s]  thought the jinx was gonna insta flash like I didn't exhaust because I was like
[18887.88s -> 18891.92s]  scared of her damage I did it because I thought she was gonna like try and flash
[18891.92s -> 18897.92s]  away the second that's but I landed my snare it was kind of bad by me I mean I
[18897.92s -> 18900.60s]  landed my snare so I didn't need to exhaust her I just was like oh maybe
[18900.60s -> 18907.12s]  she'll flash she did not she did not flash what he was this 500 LP
[18907.12s -> 18913.24s]  Masters 400 up here. It's insane. I know absolutely crazy
[18913.24s -> 18940.24s]  easy. Put that ward there because Gragas has probably bought.
[18940.24s -> 18950.80s]  They're trying to come up from bot to kill me here
[18952.80s -> 18956.92s]  Like their bot lane is rotating up to try and kill me so
[18958.88s -> 18964.84s]  Just be careful twitch there they're in here man. I actually have to back and walk look
[18970.24s -> 18977.80s]  This is hilarious the enemy bot lane literally is roaming mid look at this what?
[18980.56s -> 18982.56s]  Why
[18984.80s -> 18987.08s]  I'm not trying to soak his XP. I just want those souls
[18990.68s -> 18993.08s]  I'm scared to walk in here. I don't know where Greg says
[19000.24s -> 19012.72s]  I gotta come bot to help my twitch so they don't freeze the wave like I don't want them
[19012.72s -> 19020.72s]  to be able to freeze here even if braggits ganks we win we win the fight right now like
[19020.72s -> 19024.50s]  It's an easy fight win as long as you don't get knocked up. We just win the fight automatically
[19032.34s -> 19035.12s]  Actually, we're trying to bait Gragas to come gank this
[19043.40s -> 19047.10s]  Easy double flashes baby easy
[19051.38s -> 19053.38s]  You fucking cowards
[19064.72s -> 19071.40s]  We should back up like I can go by now. Oh, Greg is the top we could actually maybe do dragon
[19073.36s -> 19078.40s]  Yo, I'm gonna be real a soul roaming is not a not in like the top list of me being like nervous about it
[19080.72s -> 19082.72s]  Like I'm not nervous about a soul roaming man
[19086.12s -> 19088.68s]  Push this so we can oh we're diving them
[19089.72s -> 19092.98s]  That's a bit scary. Welcome to the League of Draven
[19094.12s -> 19099.32s]  Good to see you're back to enjoying the game. Whoa. We're going still diving that that's not good
[19100.04s -> 19102.04s]  Like we back off here, man. I
[19106.84s -> 19109.20s]  Mean we can maybe go up here if you really want to
[19110.72s -> 19123.52s]  I kind of want to ward this.
[19123.52s -> 19130.92s]  I need to reset though really badly right now.
[19130.92s -> 19133.72s]  Really badly.
[19133.72s -> 19137.44s]  Not being on the map here is really bad.
[19137.44s -> 19141.22s]  Rather not like having gold spent and being on the map is what I'm going to say
[19141.22s -> 19146.72s]  Like it's really fucking bad. Yo back up. You know Gragas that you watched him walk past three wards
[19148.04s -> 19150.54s]  That's why I just warded no, no, he's still here
[19151.44s -> 19153.44s]  Ragnos is right there
[19154.24s -> 19158.16s]  Like we know Gragas is somewhere bot lane right now, I don't know where but we know he's there
[19163.88s -> 19165.88s]  They're on dragon, okay
[19165.88s -> 19169.38s]  We can fight this go go go W over I'm here
[19184.76s -> 19186.76s]  Nice yo, come here
[19188.08s -> 19193.60s]  Yeah, I'll help you come get this come get it mother is blue. I got you, baby
[19195.88s -> 19220.24s]  What the fuck made a bitch
[19225.88s -> 19229.16s]  Well, I guess I'll back.
[19229.16s -> 19232.68s]  Yo, Spartan, thank you for the six months, man.
[19232.68s -> 19233.68s]  Welcome back.
[19233.68s -> 19234.68s]  Appreciate it.
[19234.68s -> 19237.52s]  I guess we'll back.
[19237.52s -> 19240.12s]  We'll get our fucking umbral.
[19240.12s -> 19246.04s]  I'm going to go top side of the map now, and I'm going to help my team get rift heralds.
[19246.04s -> 19247.04s]  I'm going to ping.
[19247.04s -> 19248.04s]  I want to go top side.
[19248.04s -> 19252.04s]  I want to help my team get rifts.
[19252.04s -> 19259.30s]  The wave if we look at bot wave it's pushing into us. It's totally fine
[19260.16s -> 19262.16s]  Okay, which is level six
[19263.58s -> 19267.54s]  The bot wave is pushing in we are totally fine to do what I'm doing right now
[19273.58s -> 19275.58s]  He doesn't know I'm here
[19282.04s -> 19289.04s]  I'm dead though.
[19289.04s -> 19297.24s]  Bro.
[19297.24s -> 19300.80s]  No joke, I almost juked that.
[19300.80s -> 19302.04s]  That's so close.
[19302.04s -> 19307.16s]  I was hoping like Wukong for some reason didn't walk topside.
[19307.16s -> 19315.86s]  the enemy bot lane did? Okay the enemy bot lane just griefed their entire game. The game's
[19315.86s -> 19323.30s]  over we win. What the fuck are they doing? What is happening? Like my twitch is just getting
[19323.30s -> 19345.30s]  free place. Wait, you guys are griefing. I'm griefing. Dude, what the fuck? Why would
[19345.30s -> 19353.22s]  you fight them guys guys guys wukong wukong okay we see that our twitch is
[19353.22s -> 19358.18s]  getting free plate spot free first turret okay I'm backed I almost soloed
[19358.18s -> 19365.54s]  their ad carry okay or their jungler why would you ever on purpose take a for a
[19365.54s -> 19373.14s]  fight like that with no oh I have cancer I also the wukong's an idiot he
[19373.14s -> 19378.54s]  He doesn't understand macro at all apparently because I literally pinged to come to Rift.
[19378.54s -> 19380.90s]  My Wukong was like nervous?
[19380.90s -> 19385.54s]  Like for some reason Wukong didn't walk top.
[19385.54s -> 19387.62s]  He sat bot trying to gank.
[19387.62s -> 19390.42s]  But the objective was Rift, not...
[19390.42s -> 19394.10s]  God, I'm losing my mind in this elo.
[19394.10s -> 19399.22s]  Masters players are literally just diamond players with slightly better mechanics.
[19399.22s -> 19402.06s]  They don't know anything about the game and I'm about to, my brain's about to
[19402.06s -> 19410.98s]  explode like a peanut. It's not about them laning 2v2 you fucking cumquat. Dude I know
[19410.98s -> 19415.82s]  they can't lane against us 2v2. It's not about the 2v2 man. We get a free Rift Herald
[19415.82s -> 19420.34s]  because we shut down their bot lane and I'm on an item spike. So we just automatically
[19420.34s -> 19434.18s]  get a free rift. It has nothing to do with 2v2. Discomquat motherfucker. I don't know why
[19434.18s -> 19449.30s]  that's my insult. The pressuring guy got to me. Somehow. Where the fuck is this ward?
[19449.30s -> 19451.30s]  Oh
[19455.86s -> 19460.92s]  Cuz I'm telling you right now my macro there was a hundred percent correct by the way like 1,000 percent
[19471.10s -> 19475.46s]  Or even though I died I know it was correct. No, no just do dragon do not die
[19475.46s -> 19479.18s]  guys we don't have to not everything's about kills not everything's about kills
[19479.18s -> 19483.30s]  we got this like you don't need to dive you don't need to dive always you don't
[19483.30s -> 19487.66s]  need to see a kill be like ooh monkey kill brain go like the game is about
[19487.66s -> 19492.26s]  like getting objectives on timers and playing off of tempo and things like
[19492.26s -> 19497.18s]  that like the only reason we even lost Rift was because my Wukong went full
[19497.18s -> 19501.14s]  monkey brain and was like no we need to not play for this Rift with a giant
[19501.14s -> 19503.14s]  Massive lead.
[19522.26s -> 19524.26s]  Wait, kill this guy.
[19524.26s -> 19532.32s]  One of my watching right now.
[19532.32s -> 19533.62s]  This is outrageous.
[19533.62s -> 19536.52s]  My Wukong just solo-ulted their- dude I'm gonna lose it.
[19536.52s -> 19549.96s]  My Wukong just solo-ulted their Gragas.
[19549.96s -> 19557.16s]  a good note though they don't get any plates off of rifting so it's not that bad okay man
[19557.16s -> 19565.96s]  just push like dude hit the minions like stop my bad sorry I'm wound up right now Kenan
[19565.96s -> 19575.24s]  okay I'm a little wound apologies if I if I grieve to you man it's fine so it'll wound
[19575.24s -> 19580.20s]  up it's fine I just don't like when like stuff like that happens I'm a
[19580.20s -> 19583.32s]  perfectionist and it's my biggest I talked about this earlier I'm a
[19583.32s -> 19588.48s]  perfectionist my biggest flaw is that like I will play the game a hundred
[19588.48s -> 19592.40s]  percent correctly on like tempo and timers but you can't do that because
[19592.40s -> 19599.20s]  you got to remember to like your teammates or teammates like they're
[19599.20s -> 19613.88s]  not just gonna instantly know exactly what you're what what to do we win the
[19613.88s -> 19625.68s]  guy don't just stand here and watch me die man holy shit that is oh my god if
[19625.68s -> 19635.44s]  If he had let me die there, I might have screamed, actually screamed out loud in anger.
[19635.44s -> 19640.44s]  Like dude is watching me kite these people within one inch of my life, and instead of
[19640.44s -> 19645.60s]  like helping or walking up and doing anything, you know what he does?
[19645.60s -> 19650.88s]  He pulls a fucking gross score.
[19650.88s -> 19651.88s]  My man just likes to watch.
[19651.88s -> 19656.88s]  something wrong with it but you know there's a time and a place
[19671.40s -> 19674.20s]  I don't actually want to buy pinks because I don't think we're strong enough
[19674.20s -> 19677.60s]  that I don't think that we're strong enough that I can actually even defend
[19677.60s -> 19681.12s]  the pinks right now if I'm being honest like we should be strong enough
[19681.12s -> 19686.14s]  But we kind of throw a lead when I over forced the rift so I think
[19690.88s -> 19692.88s]  I think
[19696.36s -> 19703.52s]  We need to push this wave so that we can get tempo and move around the map prior sorry I keep saying the wrong thing
[19703.52s -> 19715.72s]  Uh-oh. That guy's dead. I have to ditch that guy. He's dead as fuck. Oh, I'm dead too maybe?
[19715.72s -> 19722.96s]  Oh, I am so dead. Yeah, that was my bad. That was my bad. My bad, my bad. Like, we
[19722.96s -> 19728.20s]  just got- we just got ran down. That was on me.
[19728.20s -> 19734.56s]  We had good positioning but the jungler wasn't close enough so this is my ban.
[19736.72s -> 19740.72s]  I also didn't expect to get fucking 4-maned but I should have, right?
[19743.12s -> 19744.52s]  We should play for this though.
[19745.12s -> 19747.80s]  I wish I could type, I wish I wasn't chat restricted for a year.
[19749.36s -> 19752.20s]  Dude, I swear to god, I'm not even being mean.
[19752.76s -> 19756.96s]  Like Riot was like, they chat restricted me because I type so much macro
[19756.96s -> 19759.80s]  That it gets on people's nerves, and they don't want me spam typing
[19764.96s -> 19767.88s]  Low key don't play rep don't play for refs
[19778.76s -> 19784.08s]  I need help guys if you guys can help we need the clear vision on dragon
[19786.96s -> 19805.20s]  a year yeah I get uncharted April 15th or April 11th or some shit 2024 I've never seen
[19805.20s -> 19810.24s]  it it must have been like an actual riot or something like I've never seen an automated
[19810.24s -> 19814.80s]  system give you a year chat restricts right so in my mind it's got to be like an actual
[19814.80s -> 19822.62s]  like like a rioter was like dronimo we know you're good enough to climb but
[19822.62s -> 19833.64s]  stop typing you know I mean that's like what must have been going on and I'm
[19833.64s -> 19837.96s]  like okay well sure
[19844.80s -> 19853.80s]  I mean, I didn't know you could get chat band a year
[19854.48s -> 19857.36s]  What's weird is like I said, I don't I don't like say trigger word
[19857.36s -> 19862.80s]  It's not like I tell people to like end themselves and stuff. It's mainly just me typing like go here
[19862.80s -> 19869.12s]  Do that do this like I type a lot, right? Which is obviously like if you type a lot it can be toxic as well, so
[19869.12s -> 19886.68s]  Like typing a lot's annoying so I get it.
[19886.68s -> 19891.00s]  We should be playing for Baron side vision right now, not...
[19891.00s -> 19894.40s]  The vision we're playing with right now is bad, we should be playing over here.
[19895.16s -> 19899.22s]  Like I want to play for Baron vision, but it's a little hard to do that right now
[19904.36s -> 19907.92s]  Cuz you see how Tom Kenshin me are like transferring vision control around the map right now
[19908.44s -> 19912.08s]  We're playing this little support game of like hide the vision
[19913.48s -> 19916.52s]  Look at this fuck look at this motherfucker
[19924.40s -> 19926.40s]  I
[19931.38s -> 19933.38s]  He's so dumb
[19941.60s -> 19943.60s]  I still think he's dumb
[19951.70s -> 19953.70s]  How do I just take
[19954.40s -> 19962.24s]  Did I I took my entire HP bar in a global
[19964.64s -> 19968.68s]  My bad dude, I really wish the mouth fight would group though I
[19969.80s -> 19973.28s]  Get that he's like doing the thing where he's like oh, let's you know split
[19973.28s -> 19975.96s]  I like his play was actually really smart there
[19976.56s -> 19980.60s]  The mouth fights play I mean like that wasn't his fault that we got shit on at all
[19980.60s -> 19985.48s]  I just wish that he would group because if he groups up and hit the hits are we win every team fight
[19986.28s -> 19991.24s]  Because right now our only front-liner is the wukong right and the fact that wukong is our front-liner
[19991.24s -> 19993.24s]  We don't have the ability to play the game
[19994.76s -> 19996.76s]  When I get stuck on that what the fuck was that
[19998.00s -> 20004.80s]  Like that Tom kinch getting to e-forward like that blindly into our entire team and then not getting punished for it
[20004.80s -> 20007.24s]  Might be the most like solo queue thing I've ever seen
[20007.84s -> 20009.84s]  Nobody wanted to hit him because he was the tank
[20010.24s -> 20015.00s]  But uh yeah, that's we should still kill him, you know
[20020.80s -> 20024.44s]  We can fight this guy. Oh my god jungler just come oh
[20025.64s -> 20028.12s]  We're forfeiting. Okay. Now that makes perfect sense, right?

[20049.52s -> 20052.80s]  Like I need my team to actually walk over here to help me get vision
[20055.00s -> 20059.82s]  It's really frustrating because I need the frontliners the wukong in the mouth fight to walk in with me
[20060.48s -> 20064.44s]  Because I'm a little fucking why I have a big gun, but I'm a big gun girl, right?
[20064.62s -> 20068.92s]  So I need I need these two guys to walk in with me these two big burly mountain men

[20088.36s -> 20092.02s]  Wish I could type some macro right now there they're like my team is so lost
[20092.02s -> 20100.20s]  They're so beyond lost right now. It's crazy. They're lost this shit
[20108.66s -> 20112.26s]  Just do two dragon. Yes, just do this. Just do I'll start it for you. Here you go. I
[20113.02s -> 20116.82s]  Don't know why we're standing in a bush waiting for them to facecheck do dragon guys
[20116.82s -> 20126.20s]  I'm so I swear to God you have to do everything in this elo where you have to start every fight
[20126.20s -> 20131.72s]  I have to basically I have to start every fight right I have to not only start every fight
[20131.72s -> 20136.76s]  But I have to like ping my team what to do exactly because everybody plays so safe in this elo
[20137.40s -> 20139.68s]  Why did my mouth fight just stop his back?
[20141.52s -> 20143.52s]  Why are you all fighting?
[20146.82s -> 20149.48s]  Oh my god please guys.
[20152.48s -> 20154.48s]  It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[20154.48s -> 20157.48s]  No, Malfight, you can't 1v9 that.
[20157.48s -> 20158.48s]  Just back off.
[20158.48s -> 20159.68s]  They didn't get anything.
[20159.68s -> 20161.18s]  They didn't get anything, we got dragon.
[20161.18s -> 20163.18s]  We're on dragon soul points.
[20164.18s -> 20166.18s]  I'm losing hairs.
[20166.18s -> 20167.88s]  I'm losing fucking hairs man.
[20167.88s -> 20169.88s]  I ain't got many hairs to spare anymore.
[20169.88s -> 20171.88s]  We're out here losing hair.
[20176.82s -> 20180.60s]  It's like I'm babysitting like this has got to be what a preschool teacher feels like you know
[20181.26s -> 20185.92s]  Like low-key like preschool teacher. Just feels feels like this this has to be it
[20191.18s -> 20196.98s]  Like watch it's like watching a toddler like you watch them from the corner, right and they're like eating glue and you're like
[20197.74s -> 20201.14s]  I mean that's bad and then you tell him like don't eat glue don't eat glue to me
[20201.14s -> 20206.22s]  And he's like okay, and then like you leave him there for five minutes to go like do something to watch somebody else
[20206.22s -> 20213.20s]  Then all of a sudden Timmy's eating glue again, and you're like bro bro, we just had this discussion
[20220.50s -> 20223.22s]  And it's like not Timmy's fault right because he's a toddler
[20224.38s -> 20230.42s]  So you can't be mad at Timmy because he's a toddler you can't but it's like it's frustrating. It's like god damn it man
[20236.22s -> 20247.34s]  Like what is what is happening like mouth fight just group my mouth fight has a fetish with just pushing bot

[20263.38s -> 20266.50s]  Just group up, hit R, and we win.
[20266.50s -> 20271.46s]  Like I've been controlling the everliving fuck out of all the vision in this game.
[20271.46s -> 20275.34s]  I feel like I'm doing all of this to control vision and shit, and it still feels like it's
[20275.34s -> 20276.98s]  not enough.
[20276.98s -> 20279.46s]  It's kind of nuts.
[20279.46s -> 20286.22s]  Loki, it still feels not enough.

[20305.58s -> 20309.98s]  They don't know I'm there.
[20309.98s -> 20322.36s]  Well, we're just not going to ult that guy or what?

[20525.66s -> 20529.94s]  Oh my god, Walter White is like my hero right now
[20529.94s -> 20538.26s]  I don't even understand like I feel like every I feel like what Walter White felt like dealing with Skyler for literally three years
[20538.26s -> 20540.26s]  Like this is outrageous
[20540.30s -> 20545.34s]  This is what this feels like like I die. I can relate to the show so much more. Oh
[20547.14s -> 20549.14s]  My god
[20550.10s -> 20552.10s]  Like dude, I
[20552.10s -> 20554.10s]  Oh
[20576.18s -> 20578.18s]  Oh crap
[20578.18s -> 20583.18s]  Dude, look at, just look at the, like, look at, like, what's going on in the game.
[20589.18s -> 20594.18s]  Like, I, I don't even mean to be mean about this, it's just, this is, this is crazy.
[20597.18s -> 20601.18s]  Mouth fight though, popping off. Mouth fight popping off.
[20608.18s -> 20611.66s]  Like, what are you heroes this guy?
[20611.66s -> 20620.00s]  Oh, he's literally Diamond.
[20620.00s -> 20621.00s]  Why is this guy in this game?
[20621.00s -> 20624.02s]  I mean, I feel like confused now.
[20624.02s -> 20625.46s]  I'm not even blaming the Wukong anymore.
[20625.46s -> 20628.06s]  I don't know why this guy is in the game.
[20628.06s -> 20632.58s]  Oh, he has inflated the SMMR.
[20632.58s -> 20638.42s]  Oh, he just has previous season inflated the MMR.
[20638.42s -> 20639.42s]  That's what this is.
[20639.42s -> 20642.34s]  Cause he was GM for 3 years.
[20642.34s -> 20645.74s]  So his MMR says that he like belongs here even though he doesn't play it.
[20645.74s -> 20650.74s]  Like I bet you last season he only played like 50 games.
[20650.74s -> 20651.74s]  I can look, right?
[20651.74s -> 20653.82s]  We can see like how many games he played.
[20653.82s -> 20656.78s]  Yeah, he played like 50 games last season.
[20656.78s -> 20658.30s]  So like his MMR didn't really change.
[20658.30s -> 20661.26s]  He just got masters and then stopped.
[20661.26s -> 20662.26s]  Which is fine.
[20662.26s -> 20677.98s]  I just wish he would chill, you know, like not rage quit halfway through the game.
[20677.98s -> 20682.66s]  Because like I said, people's elo in shit used to bother me a lot.
[20682.66s -> 20685.50s]  I don't get bothered by it anymore because I realized it was cringe.
[20685.50s -> 20687.18s]  I don't care about their elo in shit.
[20687.18s -> 20690.14s]  What I care about is like, I just want them to play the game, you know what I mean?
[20690.14s -> 20695.18s]  I just want them to not rage not not like be absolute apes in the game and just play that's all I ask for I
[20695.66s -> 20698.98s]  Don't care if you're a diamond player plot player on the game and you're just like accidentally in the game
[20698.98s -> 20701.18s]  It's not your fault. I just want you to push buttons
[20705.34s -> 20707.74s]  What I'm doing wrong to have a 36% one rate I
[20711.42s -> 20714.52s]  Can't see the link because just you'd have to give me your name and your server
[20717.86s -> 20719.86s]  How you guys doing by the way everybody having a good day
[20720.14s -> 20722.14s]  You guys enjoying the stream having a good time

[20728.82s -> 20730.82s]  And I'm like yeah
[20730.94s -> 20733.72s]  It's rough. Well, I'm gonna take my pants off
[20750.14s -> 20752.14s]  I
[20775.42s -> 20777.42s]  Fuck you guys
[20777.42s -> 20783.26s]  They fucking like I get double swapped. Did you guys see that shit? Oh, yeah, the support could do it and then he banned Senna
[20784.46s -> 20786.46s]  I mean, I didn't hover it. So that's my bad
[20787.34s -> 20790.90s]  God damn it. I should have hovered. I was just like taking my pants off
[20793.62s -> 20795.62s]  And now he wants first pick
[20797.70s -> 20799.70s]  Dude what oh
[20800.70s -> 20804.06s]  My god, I hate I don't I don't know. I don't know what to say. This is crazy
[20807.42s -> 20816.26s]  today's Thursday right am I losing days today's Thursday right guys
[20822.82s -> 20831.94s]  it is okay cool oh what do I play they have Zareth and the Zen if Zaya I mean
[20831.94s -> 20833.94s]  I guess I could just play Rakan. It's not a big deal.
[20840.94s -> 20844.94s]  Let's see what their bot lane is though. I actually have to see what their bot lane is to choose my runes.
[20848.94s -> 20849.94s]  Sona? No.
[20850.94s -> 20852.94s]  Oh they have an Ezreal.
[20852.94s -> 20854.94s]  What the fuck is their team comp?
[20857.94s -> 20858.94s]  Okay.
[20861.94s -> 20882.38s]  When you do this build, what's the secondary supposed to be?
[20882.38s -> 20884.22s]  I think it's supposed to be this.
[20884.22s -> 20889.22s]  Or maybe like revitalize?
[20889.22s -> 20892.22s]  I just feel like I'm flinching so good.
[20892.22s -> 20896.22s]  Oh, they have a support
[20896.22s -> 20900.22s]  g-zareth. So supports are- yeah, yeah, okay, so I want
[20900.22s -> 20904.22s]  I definitely want glacial here, and I want
[20904.22s -> 20907.82s]  maybe I take MWAR, actually, instead of
[20907.82s -> 20912.22s]  armor, because they have two poke champs. And I take this.
[20912.22s -> 20917.62s]  Yeah, yeah, this is good. Okay. That's not bad.
[20917.62s -> 20920.62s]  Okay, one sec, I'll be right back. I need to get some more water.
[21607.62s -> 21610.62s]  3
[21611.62s -> 21613.62s]  3
[21613.62s -> 21616.62s]  3
[21616.62s -> 21619.62s]  3
[21619.62s -> 21622.62s]  3
[21622.62s -> 21625.62s]  3
[21625.62s -> 21628.62s]  3
[21628.62s -> 21631.62s]  3
[21631.62s -> 21634.62s]  3
[21635.62s -> 21643.14s]  Bro like you got to walk to me like I can't like my Eve is like here. I'm way over here
[21644.42s -> 21647.04s]  Right in my Eve's like yo homie
[21649.58s -> 21655.94s]  Like dude, I'm truck like we're trying to push the wave in for her and she's just not accepting to wait
[21659.10s -> 21660.74s]  And I can't W the wall
[21660.74s -> 21665.62s]  I mean, I guess I could W the wall because I was trying to walk around right I saw her in trouble when I was here
[21665.62s -> 21668.66s]  So I wanted her to walk towards here so I could e over the wall
[21669.46s -> 21672.34s]  That was my thought process e over the wall helped the guy
[21672.66s -> 21676.86s]  But he like didn't understand that and I just got shit on and it felt really bad
[21681.74s -> 21684.10s]  Both our solos are getting absolutely shit on
[21686.22s -> 21690.02s]  This is very bad because I don't know how to help our team
[21690.74s -> 21692.74s]  At this stage
[21694.94s -> 21699.26s]  Like I'm just always behind on tempo now around the map in the wrong spot at the wrong time
[21721.74s -> 21723.74s]  This is so awkward I
[21725.90s -> 21727.90s]  Have all we could kill this guy
[21732.02s -> 21738.06s]  Guess not you could maybe kill the Zen if I sneak in here
[21750.74s -> 21758.82s]  Push the wave, push the wave, hurry.
[21758.82s -> 21761.82s]  He's got to crash it.
[21761.82s -> 21778.82s]  I mean this guy is just dead.
[21778.82s -> 21786.34s]  My 80 carry is gonna get fucked for it though, so I hope it was worth like my 80 carries gonna get zones
[21793.34s -> 21797.26s]  It's really hard to tell if anything like that's worth sometimes because I
[21798.74s -> 21802.82s]  Used my ult before a dragon fight. We're gonna lose bot tower. There's just so many factors, right?
[21802.82s -> 21806.36s]  It's so hard and now I don't have words. Oh, it's so rough
[21808.82s -> 21829.10s]  I got the ignite off, but dude I can't believe that Gragas lived.
[21829.10s -> 21830.10s]  No.
[21830.10s -> 21832.20s]  Oh I had stopwatch!
[21832.20s -> 21833.20s]  I have stopwatch.
[21833.20s -> 21837.38s]  Oh my god, I'm the worst player in existence.
[21837.38s -> 21840.74s]  I actually have the ability to live there.
[21840.74s -> 21842.06s]  Oh no.
[21844.44s -> 21847.88s]  I should sell my Magi's and Shame.
[21849.22s -> 21851.22s]  I actually just want the item, so.
[21853.06s -> 21854.56s]  Dude, I'm so bad.
[21855.78s -> 21858.14s]  Dude, Gragas is low key a good pick versus Rakan though.
[21858.14s -> 21859.98s]  You can stop his engage so easily.
[21867.38s -> 21870.02s]  It's actually low key a good pick
[23100.02s -> 23102.02s]  That's what you need to do, bro.
[23102.02s -> 23107.02s]  Bro.
[23107.02s -> 23110.02s]  Bro.
[23110.02s -> 23114.02s]  Bro.
[23114.02s -> 23117.02s]  Bro.
[23117.02s -> 23120.02s]  Bro.
[23120.02s -> 23122.02s]  Bro.
[23122.02s -> 23124.02s]  Bro.
[23124.02s -> 23128.02s]  Bro.
[23128.02s -> 23129.02s]  Bro.
[23129.02s -> 23135.34s]  Wukong just use the plants. If I stay I can just die right? So I'm just misplaying all
[23135.34s -> 23139.10s]  over the place. I'm taking too much damage we're playing weak side right now right?
[23139.90s -> 23144.22s]  What I mean by that is like we know our Diana's top and we know their Wukong's bot
[23144.22s -> 23149.26s]  so because of that I need to play a lot less trady. Like I walked up and just let the Thresh
[23149.26s -> 23153.34s]  fly me for free and I missed two waves now. I need to not do that because if I don't miss
[23153.34s -> 23156.38s]  these waves it doesn't matter if we're weak siding because I'm not behind so it's
[23156.38s -> 23165.10s]  it's just really stupid now what I do want to do is I want to go check and see
[23165.10s -> 23168.90s]  if the wukong is like on our camps or something or if he's doing dragon or some
[23168.90s -> 23178.98s]  shits I should not have used the blast cone dude I am so bad I used the
[23178.98s -> 23182.78s]  blast cone to just hit it it's playing support man it makes your it
[23182.78s -> 23186.78s]  It makes your brain smaller, actually.
[23200.78s -> 23203.78s]  Like I swear playing support makes my brain smaller.
[23210.78s -> 23211.78s]  Oh they're on dragon?
[23212.78s -> 23241.78s]  I'm pretty sure I just freeze this now with the Lux.
[23241.78s -> 23247.82s]  Yeah, she's just trolling. I don't know what the fuck that was I
[23250.18s -> 23254.56s]  Took a little bit of damage, but she has to overextend now
[23271.78s -> 23280.62s]  not bad okay so the Ziyah wanted to back the reason that I froze that was
[23280.62s -> 23284.66s]  because I want the back but she can't back until we push the wave in or until
[23284.66s -> 23288.54s]  they push the wave in right so it gives me time to kind of catch up on my
[23288.54s -> 23294.26s]  back timer with the Ziyah because I'm you know a little bit behind in farm
[23301.78s -> 23303.78s]  Thresh is definitely going to go mid here.
[23303.78s -> 23308.82s]  He's either going to go mid or he's going to try and hook us from the bush.
[23308.82s -> 23311.70s]  I think I'm going to shoot my W through all of the bushes here.
[23311.70s -> 23315.22s]  Okay Thresh isn't in the bushes.
[23315.22s -> 23316.22s]  He's just mea.
[23316.22s -> 23317.22s]  Yeah we don't know where he is.
[23317.22s -> 23321.66s]  This is awkward because I can't really walk up.
[23321.66s -> 23324.58s]  I mean I guess I'm almost sick so I guess I could walk up.
[23324.58s -> 23326.62s]  Yeah there he is, okay.
[23326.62s -> 23337.02s]  we see him. He has level 5 so it's, we could probably actually fight like if this guy lands
[23337.02s -> 23352.42s]  a binding I might be able to just trade. I just, I am, I'm dead. I suck. Honestly I needed
[23352.42s -> 23353.42s]  My bad.
[23355.92s -> 23356.92s]  I'm playing bad.
[23357.42s -> 23358.42s]  That's on me.
[23359.42s -> 23360.92s]  Bilox is playing so good.
[23360.92s -> 23364.92s]  I needed a W, but then back up after the bind.
[23364.92s -> 23368.92s]  I'm just, I'm mechanically shitting on myself right now, like out of my mouth.
[23368.92s -> 23369.92s]  Just shit.
[23372.92s -> 23376.42s]  Cause I knew exactly what was gonna happen when I used W in front of the fucking Thresh's face.
[23376.42s -> 23378.92s]  I was like, here we go. You know what I mean?
[23379.86s -> 23385.40s]  Technically we're both six and he's five, but it doesn't matter because if I get hooked. I don't have enough damage. So
[23387.40s -> 23389.40s]  Now here
[23393.20s -> 23399.16s]  I'm gonna walk up and see if I can stop this I as back maybe maybe she's backing in a weird spot
[23401.28s -> 23404.36s]  Yeah, we stopped their backs huge okay now they're in trouble
[23406.04s -> 23407.68s]  so
[23407.68s -> 23409.68s]  They really needed the back on that timer
[23411.00s -> 23415.92s]  Because they just want to fight right and because they just want to fight they want to go back, right?
[23417.60s -> 23419.60s]  No way
[23422.36s -> 23426.02s]  Dude fuck off I cannot dodge a hook right now to save my fucking life
[23427.24s -> 23430.38s]  Jesus Christ. What is my movements, man?
[23433.44s -> 23435.44s]  Like tilting myself right now
[23437.68s -> 23445.16s]  I want to stay for this wave, but mid is Mia
[23447.64s -> 23449.64s]  Yeah, I can't
[23450.40s -> 23454.76s]  It feels so bad because I needed one more wave to get double pickaxe
[23455.52s -> 23457.32s]  So I can get my upgrade
[23457.32s -> 23461.32s]  Cuz like normally you go noon quiver pickaxe pickaxe if you go noon pick pick
[23461.72s -> 23465.32s]  It gives you enough ad to get your Q upgrade right and that's like the whole point
[23465.32s -> 23468.04s]  You don't need Kraken, you just need your Q upgrade because your Q upgrades when you start
[23468.04s -> 23473.04s]  bursting, but because I got hooked under the turrets, even though we got a kill, I had
[23473.04s -> 23477.72s]  to back and I couldn't get my timer.
[23477.72s -> 23479.96s]  I'm so trash.
[23479.96s -> 23487.88s]  I need some coffee, that's one of those men.
[23487.88s -> 23489.92s]  I swear to God.
[23489.92s -> 23490.92s]  Coffee is my savior.
[23490.92s -> 23520.90s]  save me.
[23520.90s -> 23523.46s]  that wave actually just did that to me holy shits
[23524.74s -> 23526.98s]  we don't actually have to do anything here crazy
[23539.14s -> 23540.18s]  nice well played
[23547.54s -> 23548.34s]  nice
[23550.90s -> 23561.98s]  Nice nice nice that was a good 2v2
[23561.98s -> 23576.66s]  Alright I got my Q upgrade now we're chilling oh now we're having a chilling oh yeah baby
[23576.66s -> 23592.54s]  You know what it is it's like I'm playing the fights too quick I just got to slow down
[23592.54s -> 23608.02s]  and like think I'm like too hyped up I really don't want to miss this wave there's
[23608.02s -> 23614.98s]  a person right there oh shit let's go yeah he's dead okay I'm gonna go farm bot
[23614.98s -> 23616.98s]  Well, that guy gets that
[23620.40s -> 23622.40s]  This locks is really good
[23631.86s -> 23634.14s]  I kind of want to oh I can't get this plate fuck
[23636.34s -> 23640.30s]  What what that was BS
[23644.98s -> 23649.58s]  Okay, you know what? I'll just take my entire HP bar really quick on the turret. It's not a big deal guys
[23650.94s -> 23656.68s]  I'm just I'm that good at the game like I don't mean to brag but like you know professional gamer over here like, you know
[23659.14s -> 23661.14s]  Gonna be the one some lessons like I got you
[23670.66s -> 23672.66s]  Dude look how big my shield is
[23674.98s -> 23692.06s]  Wait, you son of a bitch.
[23692.06s -> 23694.06s]  I mean she's dead, but...
[23707.82s -> 23709.82s]  I got outplayed, man.
[23713.26s -> 23715.26s]  Motherfucker!
[23722.06s -> 23728.02s]  All right, they forfeit it nice
[23732.90s -> 23739.14s]  Well, I need to make some coffee I'm playing give me a sec we're playing real bad. I need some coffee
[23752.06s -> 23756.22s]  Nice though, we hit 400 LP, let's go.
[23756.22s -> 23773.02s]  So now we just need 150 more, we need 550, I think 550 is GM.
[23773.02s -> 23776.86s]  I didn't do anything in that game by the way, I did nothing.
[23776.86s -> 23779.46s]  I could play another AD carry game, that was fun.
[23779.46s -> 23781.78s]  I'm gonna grab some coffee, I'll be right back.
[23783.08s -> 23784.76s]  Talks amongst yourselves boys.
[23785.24s -> 23785.96s]  I believe in you.
[23787.26s -> 23790.62s]  You can look at my 80 carry tier list that we've been trying to figure out how to do.
[23791.42s -> 23792.54s]  Enjoy. I'll be right back.
[23793.20s -> 23794.00s]  Grab some coffee.
[23794.00s -> 23794.50s]  Oh!
[23795.84s -> 23796.80s]  Fuckin' eh.
[23839.46s -> 23844.46s]  .
[23844.46s -> 23849.46s]  .
[23849.46s -> 23854.46s]  .
[23854.46s -> 23859.46s]  .
[23859.46s -> 23864.46s]  .
[23864.46s -> 23868.46s]  .
[23868.46s -> 23898.26s]  All right, I'm back.
[23898.26s -> 23913.82s]  let's go the book sweet we back boys we back
[23917.98s -> 23924.58s]  time is at five oh I probably play for like another hour and then I got to get
[23924.58s -> 23931.78s]  and make some dinner do some other shit you know I'm saying
[23939.06s -> 23942.98s]  where were we oh yeah we're making the tierless yeah I think Varys is really
[23942.98s -> 23950.46s]  good a I think Varys is good a tier cuz um in my opinion Varys is never really
[23950.46s -> 23954.80s]  like a bad pick almost like sometimes he's bad but I think he's just you can
[23954.80s -> 23958.60s]  play him on hit or you can play him without he right so he's got two builds
[23958.60s -> 23962.40s]  that you can do based on the game in the team comp his ulti is pretty much always
[23962.40s -> 23967.20s]  useful like just having a stun like a root on a champion is always gonna be
[23967.20s -> 23971.32s]  useful right then you have he's got very long range like engage you can
[23971.32s -> 23975.48s]  safely kill people with his ult in his queue you can build him poke or like
[23975.48s -> 23978.12s]  before objectives you can make picks really easily you can poke people out
[23978.12s -> 23982.82s]  before the objective, get him low. His lane phase is really good if you understand like
[23982.82s -> 23989.86s]  how to play Varus, his lane phase is exceptional. He also has in the meta currently, I feel like
[23989.86s -> 23994.50s]  he's just like a good pick. I don't think he's as good as Draven and Jinx for solo queue,
[23994.50s -> 24000.26s]  but I do think he's really good in general. You can climb with him really easily. And
[24000.26s -> 24003.46s]  And then I put Ash here too.
[24003.46s -> 24006.98s]  Maybe Ash, I don't know who I'd put in front.
[24006.98s -> 24008.48s]  Ash or Varus.
[24008.48s -> 24010.58s]  I feel like maybe Ash or maybe Varus.
[24010.58s -> 24011.94s]  I think Ash is really underrated though.
[24011.94s -> 24026.10s]  I think Ash is super, super good right now.
[24026.10s -> 24033.54s]  I think Ashe is super good because, sorry I'm trying to think, she's basically the same
[24033.54s -> 24039.54s]  idea as Varus, she's a little different but she's the same idea, she controls lane phase
[24039.54s -> 24046.34s]  pretty well, rarely her lane isn't too bad, she also has, like her R, always useful no
[24046.34s -> 24050.22s]  matter what, so like you always have use with Ashe, you always have use with Varus
[24050.22s -> 24052.82s]  R like they just stuns, snares, etc.
[24052.82s -> 24056.50s]  solo queue. She's also really good at being annoying in teamfights like you can
[24056.50s -> 24060.70s]  take ghost on ash and you can just volley sit outside the range and if you just
[24060.70s -> 24064.58s]  be basically solo people and she actually has decent scaling on her crit now so
[24064.58s -> 24068.90s]  you can go a bunch of builds too like I think you can go bork ash you can go
[24068.90s -> 24073.12s]  kraken slayer ash into bork or you could go kraken slayer into IE or you
[24073.12s -> 24077.14s]  can go kraken slayer into like whatever you can go shield bow ash if
[24077.14s -> 24079.66s]  they have tanks you can go gale force that oh you can just do a lot of
[24079.66s -> 24082.34s]  different builds on ash and I think she's really versatile. You can also
[24082.34s -> 24086.20s]  Just go the on head build if you really want. I I think the rageblade build sucks
[24086.20s -> 24089.34s]  Personally, I think that if I was gonna go on hit that would just be like shield bow
[24089.34s -> 24093.62s]  Whitsand into like Bork or some shit if I was actually gonna do that or shield bow
[24093.62s -> 24097.66s]  Bork or Bork Whits or whatever, but yeah
[24101.02s -> 24103.90s]  I don't know Ezreal is probably A tier 2
[24104.90s -> 24107.22s]  I said Ezreal is relegated by like skill
[24107.82s -> 24111.98s]  So I don't want to put him in I think if you could play Ezreal perfectly
[24111.98s -> 24118.82s]  he'd be at the top of s like he would just be above jinx just best champion of the game if you could if you could never miss a
[24118.82s -> 24122.14s]  skill shot like a hundred percent accuracy playing perfect like the champs insane right
[24122.58s -> 24125.46s]  It's absolutely crazy how good that champ is if you can play in perfect
[24125.46s -> 24127.86s]  But you're like people are humans etc
[24128.02s -> 24132.74s]  So I think he's like an a tier pick in solo queue because you can get countered like he's not blindable
[24132.74s -> 24134.74s]  You can get countered pretty easily by good players
[24135.18s -> 24139.22s]  People play like push comps people play dive comps like early game
[24139.22s -> 24142.70s]  I mean in lane and shits like because Ezreal's lane is like not it's not bad
[24142.86s -> 24146.38s]  But it's very difficult to play Ezreal well in lane fate
[24146.38s -> 24152.08s]  You got to be good mechanically and I don't think even like I've seen like challenger players who can't play Ezreal so
[24153.10s -> 24155.10s]  He's not easy
[24155.42s -> 24157.42s]  You know what I'm saying
[24169.22s -> 24171.22s]  What's up boys?
[24177.86s -> 24179.86s]  So
[24179.86s -> 24199.10s]  I was going to be in kindred but I couldn't find her.
[24199.10s -> 24201.58s]  I hate kindred.
[24201.58s -> 24206.82s]  Yo, how we doing tonight?
[24206.82s -> 24207.82s]  as everybody's there.
[24226.82s -> 24228.82s]  Okay, so this guy's picking Thresh again.
[24236.82s -> 24260.78s]  Thresh into Recon, Thresh is actually pretty good in the Recon.
[24260.78s -> 24281.34s]  They have Xayah Thresh again.
[24281.34s -> 24284.94s]  Let's play Jynx.
[24284.94s -> 24287.58s]  I like Jynx here.
[24287.58s -> 24291.54s]  Even though it is against Thresh, Jinx is a little scary, but I kind of like her in this
[24291.54s -> 24292.54s]  situation.
[24292.54s -> 24301.22s]  See what runs, do I want free boots?
[24301.22s -> 24307.66s]  Nah, I think I want to be able to get early boots this game.
[24307.66s -> 24313.10s]  Because their team comp is like, oh yeah their team comp is really annoying so I kind
[24313.10s -> 24322.22s]  want to get early boots I'll probably go present some mines although I think
[24322.22s -> 24331.40s]  over hill isn't bad actually I'll go over hill so the yeah let's these these
[24331.40s -> 24335.40s]  These runes look good. Actually, let's do this.
[24335.40s -> 24337.40s]  Or this.
[24337.40s -> 24339.40s]  This.
[24339.40s -> 24341.40s]  This.
[24341.40s -> 24348.40s]  Yeah, this is good. Okay. I kind of like these. This is good. I'm going to use these. Okay.
[24348.40s -> 24353.40s]  I'm taking clients this game because they have La Sondra and Pantheon and Thresh, right?
[24353.40s -> 24359.40s]  So with La Sondra, Pantheon and Thresh, the game's going to be like really fast of like,
[24359.40s -> 24364.34s]  Okay, if they stun me, I'm just gonna get CC chained and I'm just gonna die like after a bit, right?
[24364.72s -> 24367.68s]  It's gonna be like a stun and they're starting and they're starting this and I'm just gonna die
[24371.12s -> 24373.12s]  So I'm like nah fuck that shit
[24389.40s -> 24409.96s]  Let's see if we can get this W, boys.
[24409.96s -> 24416.48s]  Let's see if I can not fuck up the first three levels of the lane.
[24416.48s -> 24417.48s]  Got chat restricted?
[24417.48s -> 24418.48s]  Oh yeah.
[24418.48s -> 24420.48s]  It's for a while
[24423.20s -> 24428.82s]  It's Riot's secret code to make it so I can actually play the game and climb without chatting
[24428.82s -> 24453.86s]  Okay, I should have warded this bush.
[24453.86s -> 24456.82s]  I was drinking my coffee and I didn't think about it, but yeah, if you guys are against
[24456.82s -> 24466.98s]  the hook champ, always ward this bush. Right here you're gonna want to ward here early
[24466.98s -> 24473.30s]  against the most hook champions because it gives you a very nice, like they can't walk
[24473.30s -> 24476.74s]  in here and cheese you, they can't walk in here and cheese you, so you just don't
[24476.74s -> 24505.66s]  get cheesed by anything.
[24505.66s -> 24506.86s]  I mean, that's just...
[24510.36s -> 24511.66s]  I don't even know what I just saw.
[24513.06s -> 24515.46s]  I'll be real, I don't know what the fuck just happened, but okay.
[24516.76s -> 24518.66s]  I'm trying to push this wave as fast as I can.
[24519.56s -> 24522.26s]  I'm not sure I can actually get it pushed fast enough, but we're gonna try.
[24532.66s -> 24533.16s]  Damn.
[24533.66s -> 24534.56s]  It was close.
[24535.66s -> 24541.96s]  No, I'm gonna let it just push.
[24541.96s -> 24544.18s]  It's not a huge deal.
[24544.18s -> 24546.34s]  It was very close though.
[24546.34s -> 24547.74s]  We can just break the freeze, right?
[24547.74s -> 24552.46s]  It's not a huge deal.
[24552.46s -> 24554.50s]  Are they supposed to win level one?
[24554.50s -> 24555.50s]  It depends.
[24555.50s -> 24558.74s]  I mean, Ziya's not that good level one.
[24558.74s -> 24561.38s]  She's good because she has her feathers, right?
[24561.38s -> 24565.22s]  But if you can't stack your feathers level one, Jinx has more damage.
[24565.22s -> 24570.22s]  And they stacked up for my rocket, so I got like, I full stacked my lethal tempo and I
[24570.22s -> 24576.82s]  just double AoE rocketed them over and over and over and over again, right?
[24576.82s -> 24582.42s]  And so, when they finally all end, they were just behind an HP.
[24582.42s -> 24610.82s]  So Thresh missed, he only had Flay.
[24610.82s -> 24611.82s]  Damn.
[24611.82s -> 24613.22s]  That was so close, man.
[24614.22s -> 24615.12s]  Like, actually.
[24629.92s -> 24632.12s]  If Thresh had died there, or not Thresh,
[24632.12s -> 24634.32s]  if Graves had died there, we'd just win the game.
[24641.82s -> 24650.98s]  Yeah, this isn't good. Oh, I'm gonna get flayed. I'm dead
[24652.26s -> 24655.18s]  Maybe oh, maybe I'm not dead. I have to walk up like this
[24656.94s -> 24660.34s]  It was a really bad fight by the what what am I watching what the fuck?
[24661.98s -> 24663.98s]  That was just a bad fight because um
[24665.42s -> 24669.46s]  We knew graves was bought and we knew that he was gonna kill in the jungle, right?
[24669.46s -> 24674.26s]  So like my jungler already got outplayed by Graves once top side
[24674.46s -> 24679.96s]  You shouldn't ever take another fight like that bot side. You should just take the win, right like I rotated
[24680.70s -> 24684.18s]  Now granted the Rakan should have been there to help kill the graves
[24684.66s -> 24690.86s]  Like when I rotated Rakan was still jacking off in lane, right? Like when I was here Rakan was like way down here
[24690.94s -> 24693.26s]  So the support should have rotated first
[24694.38s -> 24697.30s]  Right like I rotated but the support should have been the one rotating
[24697.30s -> 24702.54s]  But again, he's just a lot of the time you have support players who don't understand timers and I had to help junk
[24702.54s -> 24706.14s]  Nobody plays for jungle support players hate playing for jungle in low elo
[24706.78s -> 24709.18s]  So it's just not a thing
[24710.10s -> 24714.64s]  So I tried to go over and help him, but I misplaced my traps a little bit
[24715.38s -> 24717.62s]  and then
[24717.62s -> 24719.70s]  the graves at a flash but he got away and
[24721.38s -> 24724.62s]  They tried to go in again when I was too low to actually help
[24724.62s -> 24727.90s]  We just got lucky we didn't lose the game off that shit
[24731.94s -> 24734.18s]  Kind of does suck those I was really strong now
[24749.70s -> 24752.84s]  Not bad I should oh I should I could have killed her
[24754.62s -> 24756.62s]  I suppose I could have killed the guy.
[24758.12s -> 24760.12s]  No joke, I totally could have killed him.
[24761.02s -> 24764.62s]  If I had warded the lantern as he tried to take it, I would have killed Zaya.
[24767.02s -> 24769.02s]  Could she ego'd the lantern there?
[24778.52s -> 24782.52s]  She ego'd the lantern so hard. If I had warded it, she dies there.
[24782.52s -> 24784.52s]  It's my bed
[24794.92s -> 24797.08s]  This game's really interesting because
[24798.56s -> 24800.78s]  The enemy ball lanes actually misplaying a lot
[24801.66s -> 24806.20s]  like they're they're really really really misplaying these fights and trades and shit, but uh
[24807.14s -> 24809.14s]  We can't abuse it
[24810.14s -> 24812.74s]  Because the graves has so much control of the game right now
[24813.26s -> 24818.44s]  That we have to basically play safe permanently at the moment and I can't do anything to help my team
[24818.60s -> 24820.60s]  It feels really bad
[24827.02s -> 24829.02s]  One of my guys again, yeah
[24829.02s -> 24854.10s]  one. See, look, Graves has bought again, man. This is so rough. Graves is mad. I want to
[24854.10s -> 24872.30s]  kill this as fast as I can. We can fight these guys 2v2 actually. Wait why didn't he just
[24872.30s -> 24886.38s]  go in. I don't know why he didn't just W immediately. Like the Recon waited. Oh that
[24886.38s -> 24894.70s]  tilts me. Like when she was against the wall here, he should have immediately W'd her.
[24894.70s -> 24900.14s]  Because if he W's from vision there right, and she's against the wall, it helps us
[24900.14s -> 24905.26s]  So much because then I can I can overlay my flame chomps on top of the I
[24905.78s -> 24908.50s]  Can overlay my flame chomps directly on top of the Zaya
[24909.18s -> 24915.86s]  Right as the fights happening rather than like having to work around the fight because thresh is in my face type shit
[24915.86s -> 24917.86s]  You know
[24920.30s -> 24923.74s]  So we're just we're honestly just losing because we're not pulling the trigger fast enough and
[24925.90s -> 24928.42s]  We can't play aggressive when we can pull the trigger
[24930.14s -> 24933.06s]  right like we're losing cuz we can't pull the trigger fast enough and when we
[24933.06s -> 24939.90s]  can't pull the trigger it's the wrong time we do this right now we get dragon
[24939.90s -> 24944.30s]  the bot lane back do we get dragon here
[24948.66s -> 24954.58s]  I want to go I actually want to go
[24954.58s -> 24958.06s]  Wait, the enemy bot lane didn't back.
[24958.06s -> 24963.28s]  Okay, they're trolling.
[24963.28s -> 24964.44s]  They lost an objective for free here.
[24964.44s -> 24965.44s]  This is really good.
[24965.44s -> 24967.88s]  So, the enemy bot lane, we fight this by the way.
[24967.88s -> 24979.20s]  We can just straight up fight.
[24979.20s -> 24986.12s]  right there is how you Lancer you've worn a Lancer by the way oh I did that
[24986.12s -> 24988.96s]  guy's so dirty
[24991.88s -> 24995.28s]  oh I'm dead bye guys
[25000.52s -> 25005.80s]  I didn't know Pantheon was Mia that was my bad I was like going I was too
[25005.80s -> 25017.50s]  happy with warding the lantern. I can't believe the enemy team greeted that
[25017.50s -> 25025.98s]  hard though for gold. Oh yeah that's actually nuts to me.
[25025.98s -> 25036.50s]  No, yeah, the Ziyas ego-ing like crazy.
[25036.50s -> 25041.66s]  The problem is, I can't abuse it constantly because like, obviously like I need teammates,
[25041.66s -> 25042.66s]  right?
[25042.66s -> 25052.66s]  I can kind of abuse it like, but it's much harder by yourself because as you can see
[25052.66s -> 25058.38s]  like I'm not playing poorly but we're getting like we're getting shit on shit
[25058.38s -> 25061.62s]  on's a bad word we're getting like
[25061.62s -> 25081.04s]  Oh, come on, man.
[25081.04s -> 25085.94s]  They misplayed that so badly.
[25085.94s -> 25089.42s]  But Rakan just ate the fucking... whatever.
[25089.42s -> 25094.98s]  I'm not gonna blame Rakan. It's fun. I'm still sad about that though. They misplayed that so incredibly badly
[25096.22s -> 25098.22s]  Like so badly
[25098.36s -> 25103.70s]  It was just that like Rick Han all into the thresh with his ultimate, but all he had to do there was
[25104.46s -> 25110.54s]  Use his E to come back to me and then play front to back afterward, but he's to see he sat there auto-wing the thresh
[25111.46s -> 25115.74s]  But you don't need to auto him. You just need to engage and then I can maybe play after it
[25119.42s -> 25122.86s]  I probably could have double killed them there, too. I kind of messed up
[25125.58s -> 25130.94s]  My team wants out it's not it's it's silly because the game's not even over
[25134.74s -> 25137.26s]  Like we actually can win this game so incredibly easily
[25138.38s -> 25143.14s]  So easily if we just play it correctly because their bot lane is really fucking bad
[25143.14s -> 25147.90s]  I didn't want to be mean, but I'll just be mean their balance really fucking bad
[25149.42s -> 25157.66s]  Well, I'm dead.
[25157.66s -> 25160.38s]  They're still bad.
[25160.38s -> 25162.06s]  I'm just ego-ing.
[25162.06s -> 25165.22s]  That was my ego.
[25165.22s -> 25166.22s]  I still stand by it.
[25166.22s -> 25167.22s]  I still think they're bad.
[25167.22s -> 25169.74s]  This guy's just playing 1v3 mid.
[25169.74s -> 25175.98s]  The Thresh has not been mid one time, so it must be the top laner.
[25175.98s -> 25181.46s]  I'm I am so frustrated right now with this game
[25185.70s -> 25191.86s]  Because I feel like we should have won so many all-ins that we didn't win barely like one like barely right like barely
[25191.86s -> 25194.54s]  Didn't win small ends. I thought we should have won all of them
[25196.62s -> 25200.66s]  Like they they didn't land like a good all-in once thrush didn't land a single hook once
[25201.70s -> 25202.66s]  and
[25202.66s -> 25207.30s]  And this is my Rakan like he just tried to he just used his R to try and engage
[25213.14s -> 25215.46s]  I think Nocturne is done mentally
[25219.38s -> 25221.38s]  Okay, so in games like this
[25223.22s -> 25225.22s]  Like this Thresh is so bad
[25232.66s -> 25234.66s]  Oh
[25248.22s -> 25251.16s]  Let's go baby huge
[25255.42s -> 25257.42s]  That was so huge let's fucking go
[25262.66s -> 25280.12s]  Like I I'm gonna hit no at 15 because dude I really don't want to lose to this
[25280.12s -> 25285.90s]  Thresh and Asaya like this Thresh is doing the most the most ego shit I've
[25285.90s -> 25290.38s]  ever seen and he's just getting away with shit like right there Thresh
[25290.38s -> 25297.14s]  walks up whiffs every spell and expects to get away with that shit nah no no we
[25297.14s -> 25302.62s]  win these we win these trust give me let me cook let me cook I see my team to
[25302.62s -> 25307.98s]  let me cook a bit you know like we had a bad early game had to play weak side
[25307.98s -> 25313.38s]  let me cook let me cook we are chilling
[25320.38s -> 25345.38s]  If I landed that, that would have been sick.
[25345.38s -> 25373.54s]  and
[25373.54s -> 25375.54s]  The rest is top two we can kill this guy
[25383.26s -> 25387.62s]  Come on guys don't forfeit guys the game is winnable. Oh my god
[25388.90s -> 25392.30s]  Dude the game is how is the Rick Han gonna forfeit?
[25394.46s -> 25397.38s]  Dude that game is so winnable it hurts
[25397.38s -> 25414.74s]  like dude really that actually is so infuriating that's so infuriating man
[25414.74s -> 25422.82s]  that game was so incredibly winnable like look at this I did more damage than
[25422.82s -> 25431.28s]  every single player on the enemy team. If my team just relaxed, we win the game a thousand
[25431.28s -> 25438.50s]  times over that game. Like the game is over. We have a Recon, a Rumble, and a Wukong for
[25438.50s -> 25444.34s]  me to sit behind. And we saw how bad their bot lane was, right? I have Quendons for the
[25444.34s -> 25449.78s]  only way they can kill me. Whatever, man. Dude, I wish to god- I'm gonna report
[25449.78s -> 25455.14s]  Like these fuckers I guarantee I get a notification. There's no way these people are not toxic
[25457.18s -> 25463.48s]  There's no way you in this like you just want out of the game after a fucking your team is just doing well
[25465.02s -> 25471.42s]  No, man the score is 10 to 14 10 to 14
[25473.70s -> 25475.90s]  You have a Fed 80 carry
[25479.78s -> 25488.62s]  Look at this, dude we forfeited, we were down 2.5k.
[25488.62s -> 25495.06s]  We had a better scaling comp than them, like we outscaled them.
[25495.06s -> 25502.54s]  We have two dragons, we outscaled them, and we're down 2.5k.
[25502.54s -> 25506.46s]  And my team rage hits forfeit.
[25506.46s -> 25510.06s]  Oh my god, that's so gross.
[25510.06s -> 25512.46s]  That is so disgusting.
[25518.06s -> 25519.14s]  So disgusting.
[25524.46s -> 25528.90s]  Why am I in a game with this player?
[25528.90s -> 25531.92s]  I'm 412 LP Masters.
[25531.92s -> 25540.36s]  I was in a game just now with a 7 LP Masters jungler.
[25540.36s -> 25541.80s]  And he's not on a smurf.
[25541.80s -> 25545.68s]  This is not a smurf account.
[25545.68s -> 25549.60s]  Because last season this guy was d4.
[25549.60s -> 25551.52s]  So he's not on a smurf.
[25551.52s -> 25556.52s]  Why is this player in my game?
[25556.52s -> 25561.04s]  Why is this player in a 400 LP Master game?
[25561.04s -> 25569.84s]  Why? Or rather, why am I in a Diamond 1 game?
[25569.84s -> 25572.92s]  You can go to his previous games, he doesn't even have good MMR.
[25572.92s -> 25578.40s]  Like if you look at these games, they're all like 100-200LP, right?
[25578.40s -> 25579.68s]  Why am I in this game?
[25579.68s -> 25583.32s]  Why did you put me in a game with this player?
[25583.32s -> 25584.32s]  Like this guy?
[25584.32s -> 25585.56s]  I don't even care if he sucks.
[25585.56s -> 25589.80s]  I'm more frustrated at the fact that these players, mental boom at the first
[25589.80s -> 25596.12s]  sign of any negativity. Look at this. They just give up. First sign of anything negative, they go next.
[25597.80s -> 25603.24s]  Like, I actually could have 1v9ed this game too. Like, actually. But I'm not allowed to try and 1v9
[25603.24s -> 25608.92s]  because my team wants out of the game at fucking four minutes, or 15 minutes. That sucks, man.
[25610.52s -> 25617.40s]  The new system is trash. Like, I'm sorry, but the 4-5-15 system is good sometimes.
[25617.40s -> 25622.84s]  They should have a requirement that you have to be losing by x amount of gold for it to kick in
[25623.64s -> 25625.64s]  That should that should be it
[25625.64s -> 25627.36s]  They should have a requirement
[25627.36s -> 25630.84s]  You have to be losing by 5k plus for it to work at 15
[25634.00s -> 25636.00s]  Like there needs to be something
[25636.44s -> 25643.60s]  Where there's a requirement because people are so stupid, right? Like that game was a hundred percent ours
[25643.60s -> 25647.84s]  We had two dragons. We're down 2,000 gold at at 16 minutes and
[25648.84s -> 25652.78s]  Wukong's three and one we were done four kills Wukong's three and one
[25656.60s -> 25660.08s]  I'm I'm I'm literally insanely strong
[25661.20s -> 25665.46s]  Even though we got weak side it. I'm still winning. We just to be to them bot side of the map, right way
[25665.46s -> 25667.46s]  We just want a 2v2
[25668.44s -> 25670.44s]  Rumble's just like like ah
[25671.00s -> 25673.00s]  Sorry, I'm just mad. I'm mad
[25673.60s -> 25680.76s]  Like they need to require they need to require something other than four people like require four people and a gold lead or something
[25680.76s -> 25682.76s]  Like that's so cancer
[25684.64s -> 25686.76s]  That's so fucking frustrating men
[25689.20s -> 25691.60s]  Like I can't believe how bad people's mentals are
[25692.84s -> 25699.48s]  Like the okay, I get it the rumble and the the rumble and the nocturne. I understand wanting to forfeit, okay?
[25699.48s -> 25703.84s]  Okay, they're having a bad game. They want out. They're raging. They need to get their frustration. I get it
[25704.00s -> 25706.00s]  But why are we forfeiting?
[25708.96s -> 25711.56s]  When Wukong is three and one I
[25712.76s -> 25716.76s]  Have seven of our KP. I'm the 80 carry. I'm very strong. I just got my mythic
[25717.32s -> 25719.32s]  We have two dragons and
[25720.00s -> 25722.28s]  Rickon's forfeiting to I don't know man
[25726.32s -> 25728.32s]  That's just frustrating is all
[25729.48s -> 25738.00s]  Like, I'll be real, I carry this game every day of the week.
[25738.00s -> 25739.20s]  Every day of the week I carry those.
[25759.48s -> 25770.48s]  So apparently riot is doing something about smurfing though and I can't wait until they
[25770.48s -> 25772.60s]  do.
[25772.60s -> 25776.36s]  This is actually a really good thing that I wanted to talk about earlier in the stream
[25776.36s -> 25778.12s]  but I forgot.
[25778.12s -> 25781.68s]  Apparently riot is like doing something to make smurfing harder because apparently
[25781.68s -> 25788.72s]  smurfing is outrageous right now and I kind of think that they need to stop this too.
[25788.72s -> 25796.08s]  So there's a thing you can do in solo queue right now where you can make a new account
[25796.08s -> 25803.48s]  and you can duo with somebody on different accounts on a new account and your MMR doesn't
[25803.48s -> 25809.20s]  actually get lowered.
[25809.20s -> 25817.16s]  So if you win a game, let's say you win a game, I think this is just him wobbling
[25817.16s -> 25824.88s]  the account but let's say you win a game and in that game you duo with somebody in a lower
[25824.88s -> 25829.88s]  MMR right now when you duo in a lower MMR I don't know if this guy did this or not but
[25829.88s -> 25835.24s]  when you duo with somebody in a lower MMR your MMR is based on now the game thinks
[25835.24s -> 25839.28s]  that you're in that MMR and you can do it in placements.
[25839.28s -> 25843.92s]  So in your very first games for some reason there's no MMR lock on placements.
[25843.92s -> 25850.68s]  So you can in your placements duo with somebody who's like bronze, right?
[25850.68s -> 25852.40s]  And you can play with them.
[25852.40s -> 25857.44s]  And then the game thinks you're still winning, so it keeps amplifying your MMR.
[25857.44s -> 25861.56s]  So I'm describing this really poorly, but essentially you can duo in lower elos, and
[25861.56s -> 25866.28s]  the game doesn't know your MMR belongs in that elo, because you're winning in that
[25866.28s -> 25867.28s]  elo.
[25867.28s -> 25870.40s]  The game can't figure that out for some reason, the algorithm.
[25870.40s -> 25877.44s]  So when they stopped duo queuing, it still inflated their MMR to where it would be if
[25877.44s -> 25879.28s]  they had solo queued.
[25879.28s -> 25881.88s]  Does that make sense?
[25881.88s -> 25886.24s]  So it basically says that they went like 10-0 in their placements.
[25886.24s -> 25891.58s]  So now they're in like a master tier MMR from a brand new account.
[25891.58s -> 25899.44s]  So now those people are in like D1 masters MMR, but they played, they won in gold.
[25899.44s -> 25909.84s]  I also don't think you smurfing should be so easily accessible.
[25909.84s -> 25914.72s]  Like this guy's not a bad player per se, but I don't think he's a master tier player.
[25914.72s -> 25917.98s]  This guy's a rumble player on a new account.
[25917.98s -> 25920.92s]  From that game alone, the fact he gave up tells me he's not a good player.
[25929.44s -> 25949.32s]  Dude, I'm a heavy advocate for Riot, you have to attach a verification to your accounts.
[25949.32s -> 25953.88s]  I know Riot would never do that, but I'm a heavy advocate for having to attach verification
[25953.88s -> 25957.52s]  to play ranked.
[25957.52s -> 25961.88s]  I think it would be great, honestly.
[25961.88s -> 25975.24s]  I think it would help so much.
[25975.24s -> 25977.40s]  If you get your verified account banned, are you done for it?
[25977.40s -> 25978.40s]  Yeah.
[25978.40s -> 25981.20s]  You have to get like a VPN to play other than like you would have to.
[25981.20s -> 25982.60s]  That's my point though.
[25982.60s -> 25987.60s]  Like, if you get your verified account banned, right?
[25987.64s -> 25989.82s]  Like, okay, that account's done.
[26006.32s -> 26008.28s]  Like I said, I don't think Riot would ever do it
[26008.28s -> 26011.60s]  because it's too extreme
[26011.60s -> 26014.24s]  And I don't think Riot has the balls to ever do that shit.
[26014.24s -> 26015.88s]  VPN's only $5.
[26015.88s -> 26017.64s]  Yeah, but dude, are you gonna tell me
[26017.64s -> 26019.84s]  that you're gonna buy it?
[26019.84s -> 26021.80s]  People who get banned on accounts
[26021.80s -> 26023.64s]  typically get banned consistently.
[26023.64s -> 26026.16s]  That's why they're making smurfs.
[26026.16s -> 26027.32s]  Right?
[26027.32s -> 26029.36s]  So you're telling me somebody's gonna be willing
[26029.36s -> 26032.60s]  to pay $5 for a new phone number verification
[26032.60s -> 26036.08s]  or whatever every time they have to make a new account?
[26036.08s -> 26036.92s]  They're not.
[26041.60s -> 26048.60s]  Not you me.
[26048.60s -> 26049.60s]  Lulu.
[26049.60s -> 26050.60s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26050.60s -> 26051.60s]  Okay.
[26051.60s -> 26052.60s]  Don't I have smurfs?
[26052.60s -> 26053.60s]  Yeah, I do.
[26053.60s -> 26058.60s]  And I stand by all my smurfs should be attached to the same, like, account.
[26058.60s -> 26064.60s]  Like, if you make a smurf, okay, this is what I think should happen.
[26064.60s -> 26067.52s]  You should be able to put all of your smurfs on one account.
[26067.52s -> 26073.96s]  So you can make smurfs and you can add that smurf verification to an account.
[26073.96s -> 26074.96s]  But it kind of like battle.net.
[26074.96s -> 26075.96s]  Does that make sense?
[26075.96s -> 26080.48s]  You know how like battle.net has all your accounts in the battle.net thing, but you can sign
[26080.48s -> 26082.16s]  in to battle.net?
[26082.16s -> 26087.40s]  I think that the way to make it viable would be like you could put all, if you didn't
[26087.40s -> 26091.60s]  have a second phone number or didn't want one, you could put smurfs up to like a limit.
[26091.60s -> 26095.24s]  So you could have like three smurfs or like two smurfs in your main account, right?
[26095.24s -> 26097.40s]  So you could have like three total accounts
[26097.40s -> 26099.12s]  and you would have to like,
[26099.12s -> 26102.80s]  you could add those to the same like Omega account, right?
[26102.80s -> 26105.44s]  And that Omega account could be your verified account.
[26105.44s -> 26107.52s]  Now, if any of your accounts get punished
[26107.52s -> 26110.88s]  on your Omega account, all of your accounts get punished.
[26115.30s -> 26116.60s]  So if any of your accounts get punished,
[26116.60s -> 26118.00s]  all of them get punished.
[26125.24s -> 26134.32s]  Like I feel like that'd be a good play maybe I'm wrong but I feel like it would work you
[26134.32s -> 26138.40s]  know what's up rush I caused you rush what's up our F
[26138.40s -> 26148.96s]  What do I want to play I don't know I don't know what I want to do here
[26148.96s -> 26151.28s]  Self-arranged, okay.
[26151.28s -> 26152.56s]  I wish I didn't have cleanse.
[26152.56s -> 26154.88s]  Cleans is so worthless this game, wait, actually.
[26156.68s -> 26158.16s]  Cleans does nothing this game at all.
[26159.36s -> 26160.80s]  I'm just down to some.
[26160.80s -> 26164.44s]  Like maybe if the brand like tries to flash stun me or some shit,
[26164.44s -> 26166.00s]  but I'm just like down to summoner.
[26178.96s -> 26182.96s]  Alright boys, we got Nightblue 3 on our team.
[26185.76s -> 26186.76s]  This is a throwback.
^[[6~^[[6~^[[6~^[[6~^[[6~[27708.96s -> 27710.96s]  Okay, that's all I have to say about this.
[27710.96s -> 27712.96s]  I hope you enjoyed this video.
[27712.96s -> 27714.96s]  Thanks for watching.
[27714.96s -> 27716.96s]  I'll see you in the next video.
[27716.96s -> 27718.96s]  Bye!
[27738.96s -> 27740.96s]  Bro, I'm streaming.
[27758.96s -> 27761.96s]  Dude, the homie thought I'm a scripter.
[27762.96s -> 27766.96s]  You know, I'll take it. My ego feels good.
[27768.96s -> 27777.48s]  Honestly, that feels good.
[27777.48s -> 27778.48s]  That feels good.
[27778.48s -> 27779.48s]  Hi, Lil.
[27779.48s -> 27784.88s]  I thought it was a script.
[27784.88s -> 27786.72s]  Dude, I'm not gonna lie though.
[27786.72s -> 27790.40s]  Some of those movements were sus as fuck that I was making.
[27790.40s -> 27795.12s]  Like I was, like, I like turned on the fucking mental scripts for that game.
[27795.12s -> 27800.68s]  Some of those movements early were nuts.
[27800.68s -> 27807.00s]  Just like this tiny little movements I was doing early game in lane were crazy.
[27807.00s -> 27808.00s]  Look at this.
[27808.00s -> 27809.00s]  Watch this.
[27809.00s -> 27810.00s]  Like this movement right here, right?
[27810.00s -> 27815.84s]  Like, look.
[27815.84s -> 27818.00s]  I dodge that, right?
[27818.00s -> 27823.52s]  Then I walk up, cleanse the thing, kite down.
[27823.52s -> 27834.40s]  like that that movement is gross man look that was actually some gross-ass
[27834.40s -> 27844.20s]  movement I'm not gonna lie we this in the corner man in the corner my brain was
[27844.20s -> 27846.04s]  like
[27846.04s -> 27852.60s]  Yo Andromeda, thank you man. Yo you played really good. Now I felt bad
[27852.60s -> 27856.40s]  I felt so bad because I was griefing like I was
[27856.92s -> 27861.70s]  Like at the start of the game. We were just snow like I literally fucked up like three times
[27862.48s -> 27865.08s]  During like the really important fights, and I was like, oh no
[27870.04s -> 27873.60s]  Yeah, thank you for the beds can I play Calista I can
[27876.04s -> 27889.24s]  I'm trying to figure out if I want to play a Callista game, or if I want to go make dinner.
[27889.24s -> 27892.04s]  There was one other movement that I thought was kind of nuts.
[27892.04s -> 27898.72s]  I did a really good movement too, somewhere, I don't remember what it was.
[27898.72s -> 27900.08s]  Here's where I fucked up.
[27900.08s -> 27905.08s]  So right now, I should have just been, for some reason my brain lagged, and I
[27905.08s -> 27910.32s]  I should have just been sitting here um I should have just cleansed and then started fighting the twitch
[27911.16s -> 27914.68s]  For some reason I didn't cleanse, but this wasn't like your fault at all
[27914.68s -> 27916.48s]  Like I the second the twitch flashed
[27916.48s -> 27920.02s]  I should have insta cleansed the ignite and I should have just been killing him
[27920.44s -> 27923.32s]  Like right now just like auto-ing because I can't get away from him, right?
[27923.32s -> 27926.70s]  It but it took me an extra second. See how I I started fighting him now
[27926.70s -> 27934.60s]  Like I barely died I wouldn't have died had I cleansed and had I just turned
[27934.60s -> 27938.18s]  initially it was fine
[27941.10s -> 27945.54s]  and then like here I fucked up too because I went in and I thought we were
[27945.54s -> 27947.54s]  6. Oh
[27954.38s -> 27956.38s]  I could have killed that guy I
[27957.06s -> 27960.78s]  Should have gone forward one more. Oh, you know what? I should have done there
[27960.78s -> 27965.86s]  I should have gone forward one more auto killed this guy Lulu would have gotten six off of the kill
[27965.86s -> 27970.52s]  I would have used my speed to come back out then she could have altered me. We could have killed the
[27971.54s -> 27974.34s]  We could have got the twitch and then we could have turned on this echo too
[27975.54s -> 27985.76s]  Oh, this was a really cool 2v2.
[27985.76s -> 27992.78s]  I actually thought this 2v2 was really sick.
[27992.78s -> 27994.70s]  Lulu is a real one for this, man.
[27994.70s -> 27997.78s]  Listen, you're a real one for this one.
[27997.78s -> 28001.58s]  You just took the death to save me.
[28001.58s -> 28003.58s]  Respect.
[28003.58s -> 28005.58s]  Respect.
[28005.58s -> 28007.58s]  You're a real one for that.
[28011.58s -> 28013.58s]  That was so good.
[28018.58s -> 28020.58s]  Jesus was fun. Yeah, Jesus.
[28020.58s -> 28022.58s]  You were the best support I've had today.
[28022.58s -> 28025.58s]  Like, legitimately, you played better than all the other players in the SEALA.
[28025.58s -> 28027.58s]  That was really good.
[28027.58s -> 28029.58s]  Like, I was surprised. I was telling my stream, I was like, yeah.
[28029.58s -> 28031.58s]  She's actually like, they...
[28031.58s -> 28037.66s]  They, I said she because you're a little, I don't know, you know, but I was like, yeah, she's playing super good
[28037.66s -> 28039.66s]  She's playing way better than all of my fucking teammates
[28044.38s -> 28047.32s]  Yo, what time is it? It's six
[28048.42s -> 28054.10s]  Man, do I want to do I want to keep streaming or do I want to go to or do I want to go get food and go to the gym I
[28056.14s -> 28059.12s]  Can't like 24 hour fitness is not actually 24 anymore
[28059.12s -> 28062.32s]  So I'd have to go soon if I'm gonna go to the gym
[28066.52s -> 28068.52s]  But it is only like six
[28080.92s -> 28083.22s]  But I could just end on I
[28084.16s -> 28088.40s]  Could just end on the hitting the like 400 LP mark and just chill for now
[28089.12s -> 28096.16s]  Right, like we hit 400 OP, we'll probably hit GM tomorrow.
[28096.16s -> 28101.60s]  So I could just chill for now and then we can just hit GM tomorrow.
[28101.60s -> 28106.60s]  That's probably a better idea, because then I won't get mad, like say, say we get, like,
[28106.60s -> 28109.80s]  like say we get another game like this, right?
[28109.80s -> 28112.80s]  Like say, say we get another game like this where like we're literally winning
[28112.80s -> 28116.20s]  the game and my team's like, no, let's forfeit, like that's going to make me mad.
[28116.20s -> 28117.20s]  I was mad.
[28117.20s -> 28118.20s]  This is going to make me mad.
[28118.20s -> 28123.20s]  So I'd rather just like get off on a good note like a happy note, you know, like not be tilted
[28129.60s -> 28133.60s]  GM tomorrow, yeah, I hope so I've been I think I can get Challenger back this year
[28133.60s -> 28135.60s]  But we got to get to GM first
[28135.96s -> 28140.84s]  I'm telling you I this elo is so miserable like master tier is
[28141.56s -> 28148.16s]  The worst elo I've ever played in in my 12 years of playing this game
[28148.20s -> 28157.84s]  whatever NA 300 400 LP masters is is literally disgusting these these are
[28157.84s -> 28164.36s]  not real people like I feel like half these games we are playing with NPCs
[28164.36s -> 28169.12s]  who quite literally don't even like I don't even know what to say of their
[28169.12s -> 28174.84s]  bots and they can't be real humans they get mad over nothing they rage quit over
[28174.84s -> 28180.84s]  nothing they give up at 15 minutes when we're winning the game these cannot be real people.
[28182.76s -> 28190.92s]  So I swear to god the game has to get better in GM it has to get better there's no world
[28190.92s -> 28197.96s]  that it gets worse like I refuse to believe that because this is this is the worst grind I've
[28197.96s -> 28211.16s]  ever had. Is it bad to be a bot? Are you saying I'm bot-est? Are you gonna cancel me because
[28211.16s -> 28218.00s]  I don't like bots? I said it. I'm saying it. I don't like fucking bots. Whoa. Okay, I didn't
[28218.00s -> 28221.68s]  need to add fuck. You know what? I'm gonna get off. Yeah, that's it. That's it for
[28221.68s -> 28227.04s]  me. I'm gonna get off, boys. I'm tired. I need to go to the gym before I run
[28227.04s -> 28232.44s]  out of juice, make some dinner, I will be live tomorrow, same time as today. I've been starting
[28232.44s -> 28239.56s]  my stream at 10am, my time, maybe I'll do it tomorrow at 9am, I don't know, it's 10
[28239.56s -> 28245.64s]  or 9, between there I always start my stream. And so, and that's my time, so it's like
[28245.64s -> 28253.08s]  7, 8, 9 PST. You're good at 88, thanks man, I think I suck. My goal is hopefully
[28253.08s -> 28260.96s]  I can get challenger back and then I'm not gonna play like I just want to my goal is challenger so that I can prove to myself
[28262.12s -> 28264.12s]  It's a really stupid thing
[28264.12s -> 28266.80s]  But I want to prove to myself that I can still do it at 32
[28267.24s -> 28270.48s]  Because 10 years ago was the first time I started streaming this year, right?
[28270.48s -> 28274.00s]  I've been streaming for 10 years this year and so I want to get challenger
[28275.04s -> 28279.08s]  Because when I first started streaming I was in challenger and I want to see if like after 10 years
[28279.08s -> 28281.08s]  I can still do it
[28281.08s -> 28283.48s]  And then I'm never gonna care again
[28284.38s -> 28287.20s]  This will be the only time I ever give a shit about getting challenger
[28287.20s -> 28290.74s]  I just want to get it see if I care and then play for content, you know
[28292.32s -> 28296.56s]  But uh, yeah, it's just it's like welcome to the League of Draven
[28297.40s -> 28303.88s]  See if the old man who has fucking arthritis and fucking carpal tunnel and all that shit, you know what I'm in
[28304.12s -> 28306.12s]  See if I can still do it
[28306.76s -> 28309.80s]  Yo, thank you for the twitch prime man. I appreciate it. Thank you so much
[28310.44s -> 28313.40s]  Appreciate it a lot dude. All right guys, that's gonna be it for me
[28313.40s -> 28317.72s]  If you like to stream don't forget to follow all my socials and tiktok and Facebook and Instagram and all that shits
[28317.76s -> 28320.84s]  All the clickable garbage is underneath the stream. Don't forget to check it out
[28322.08s -> 28324.48s]  I'll be back tomorrow same time in the morning. I
[28325.76s -> 28329.00s]  Tomorrow's my last day for the weekend though. I'm not gonna stream on Saturday
[28329.00s -> 28335.32s]  I might do some off-off stream grinding on Saturday. I've been taking I've been like forcing myself to take a day off of streaming
[28335.32s -> 28340.00s]  every week just so like I can mentally recharge and I think it's actually been
[28340.00s -> 28343.76s]  really good for my stream because like I've been in a much better mood while
[28343.76s -> 28347.76s]  streaming and I've been much less tilted and I've been even if I play League
[28347.76s -> 28351.80s]  off stream or whatever it's just like it doesn't feel as forced so I feel like
[28351.80s -> 28355.52s]  the break's nice so yeah tomorrow no stream on Saturday tomorrow for sure and
[28355.52s -> 28359.76s]  Sunday I might I might do a short stream but yeah I'll see you guys then
[28359.76s -> 28361.76s]  Thanks for watching. I appreciate it guys
[28363.36s -> 28366.20s]  And yeah, that's it. I'm gonna go make dinner
[28368.28s -> 28370.72s]  Oh, we guys have a good night day wherever the fuck you are
[28371.32s -> 28376.62s]  Later dudes, hope you guys have a good one. It was fun playing with it in drama. Go look on the games
[28377.32s -> 28379.32s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow. Peace
