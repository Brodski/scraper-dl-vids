[190.19s -> 195.62s]  That guy has
[195.80s -> 197.00s]  GP
[197.00s -> 215.52s]  bees
[215.52s -> 254.07s]  Jesus
[254.07s -> 256.07s]  Yo, hey, what's up, man?
[256.07s -> 318.92s]  What's up, dudes?
[318.92s -> 327.07s]  Yeah, I mean we're hoping we'll see man. We'll see
[330.23s -> 390.85s]  Fingers fucking crossed right do I ever actually
[392.13s -> 462.88s]  I'm wondering if I I'm assuming I'm just playing at math. No way. Yay
[463.68s -> 484.14s]  Yeah, this is probably just me doing fucking I'm probably just doing star Guardian
[498.34s -> 500.34s]  Welcome to the League of Dream!
[629.55s -> 780.80s]  So I go to seven next rounds and then hopefully we can hit
[782.14s -> 806.38s]  Some shit I kind of like this actually because now we can make I
[807.64s -> 809.28s]  can actually make a
[809.28s -> 811.28s]  guard breaker and I could also make
[811.76s -> 848.96s]  We go a guard breaker and mess. I kind of want to just ionic spark, but I don't know if I should I need
[850.44s -> 853.64s]  An echo a neko or a round
[853.64s -> 857.36s]  I also could use an Ezreal. I need like a quick draw. I
[858.96s -> 860.96s]  Should have kept that Lucian from earlier
[861.28s -> 950.56s]  This guy's a level 3 Blitzcrank and he's just so fucking strong. It's stupid. This is really interesting
[950.56s -> 957.76s]  I guess I could go Spellslinger as well
[958.28s -> 977.75s]  And we just give the Shiv to TF
[1006.02s -> 1044.34s]  We just do this for now, too. I guess I could use I could do Jeweled Gauntlet. I don't know
[1044.90s -> 1104.87s]  Could jeweled gauntlet this shit up. See how it goes. I need to like throw an item down
[1105.91s -> 1111.82s]  But I feel like Morello's is bad. I guess I could just use hat
[1112.38s -> 1147.96s]  Or like I said before jeweled gauntlet could be good. I don't know. I could just roll on seven two trying three star stuff
[1148.34s -> 1154.28s]  This guy has three Kaisa's though
[1154.48s -> 1162.00s]  This guy has one Kaisa kind of hard to three star Kaisa. I could three star Nyla
[1162.60s -> 1193.10s]  Like I saw eight with fucking 20 gold
[1194.50s -> 1355.20s]  here he has MF and your blitzcrank is insane. Dude that Gnar just
[1355.20s -> 1371.54s]  murked me. I did not position for the Gnar and I got fucked for it. This
[1371.54s -> 1404.30s]  motherfucker. Dude I wish I could get some stick frontline leveled up. That'd be
[1404.30s -> 1419.78s]  cool.
[1419.78s -> 1425.39s]  Oh
[1458.39s -> 1460.39s]  My god another NAR
[1541.95s -> 1547.27s]  Well rip I was gonna go MF and then I like decided to go Nikko and I just fucked it all up
[1547.27s -> 1572.24s]  Oh, well. Oh, well time is at 10
[1618.77s -> 1620.61s]  What's up boys
[1620.61s -> 1647.40s]  How's everybody doing? Oh, I'll be right back. Sorry. I'm still waking up. Let me give me one sec. What's up sky? Oh
[1675.16s -> 1677.16s]  Okay, oh
[1679.70s -> 1682.82s]  Yeah, baby, I was gonna play on my main at the start but dude
[1682.82s -> 1687.26s]  I don't know if I can sit through fucking eight minute queue times to get people raging at each other all day
[1687.58s -> 1690.30s]  So we'll we'll do some warm-up on this account for a bit
[1690.86s -> 1705.88s]  What a Mars discount like D one low master
[1705.88s -> 1718.52s]  like my other accounts like 500 this one's I want to say like I don't know the
[1718.52s -> 1723.02s]  MMR is really awkward when you get like low masters right like the MMR is super
[1723.02s -> 1726.88s]  awkward so I don't know what the MMR is but I know it's low masters so like
[1726.88s -> 1731.68s]  sometimes there's diamonds sometimes there's like 100 LP players somewhere
[1731.68s -> 1743.66s]  between there dude I I played some games off stream yesterday I got up to
[1743.66s -> 1757.44s]  like 400 LP then I lost three in a row that shit was painful I did into one of
[1757.44s -> 1771.20s]  tenacity's games though so that was fun that felt bad no yes straight up it
[1771.20s -> 1775.32s]  felt so bad he was doing so good too like I straight up just had a bad game
[1775.32s -> 1781.11s]  and I felt I felt like shit look at this shit I just dropped like eight
[1781.11s -> 1787.19s]  deaths look at the shits like he was just straight up smurfing on the
[1787.19s -> 1793.27s]  enemy top laner and we all the entire team just like decided to collectively run it down
[1793.27s -> 1808.87s]  like we all just got shit on this was a really weird game because i feel like uh that game
[1808.87s -> 1813.35s]  was like the first game i felt everybody in the game was like actually high gm challenger
[1813.35s -> 1823.20s]  but they weren't right at that there's a very weird system going on let's do
[1823.20s -> 1838.03s]  a cassiopeia game like i'll show you guys what i mean in a second i'm assuming
[1838.03s -> 1846.85s]  I should go this right? This is probably good or this
[1848.01s -> 1857.46s]  That's probably good, too. Oh, well, okay. So yeah, we'll get this stuff
[1858.48s -> 1865.38s]  Like me and Tonto is like he's been challenger for a long time, right? I don't even know who the fuck this guy was
[1867.24s -> 1875.84s]  Some random Senna player who's like not playing Senna now and then this guy was like trying to jungle and just like running
[1875.84s -> 1877.62s]  It down
[1877.62s -> 1881.10s]  It was I don't even know it was the weirdest game that I've played in a while
[1882.78s -> 1885.54s]  Cuz like my ad carry wasn't bad
[1886.34s -> 1890.60s]  Like this guy's clearly like on a smurf, but I don't know how good he was cuz he wasn't bad at the game
[1892.12s -> 1894.12s]  The enemy ad carry wasn't bad
[1895.08s -> 1900.78s]  This guy's also on a smurf. It was the weirdest Lobby. It was like a bunch of smurf accounts all
[1901.62s -> 1909.73s]  Playing with each other, but it was like a non smurf queue. This guy was like the only non smurf
[1909.73s -> 1922.61s]  It was interesting. Oh
[1922.89s -> 1930.01s]  Do I take ghost here or do I just I thought ghosts could be really OP versus their team with Cassiopeia
[1930.01s -> 1939.48s]  But maybe I should just take I'm gonna try it. Oh
[1940.52s -> 1946.66s]  Somebody dodged cuz yeah, I don't know. I never know. I never know if I should take ghost ignite, whatever
[1948.46s -> 1954.62s]  Because I feel like ghosts with Cassio's feels like the same things ad carry right same idea where it feels really OP
[1955.18s -> 1966.76s]  Dude, there's so much drama going on in the league community yet again
[1967.28s -> 1996.60s]  By the way, like it's it's insane. Yeah. I don't know man. I I
[1997.88s -> 2001.32s]  just I'm
[2001.32s -> 2006.70s]  I like I like looking at drama
[2007.34s -> 2008.78s]  cuz like
[2008.78s -> 2016.88s]  Dramas juicy like I like looking at drama, but it's also like how are people so stupid?
[2033.54s -> 2035.54s]  Yeah, I'm getting like I I
[2036.22s -> 2043.82s]  Don't know man. My view on all of this shit is like I I guess I'm just not hardwired that way
[2043.82s -> 2049.36s]  I I can't mentally wrap my head around being like excited to flirt with underage girls
[2049.94s -> 2057.44s]  Or like when like I I just I I've never like had the want
[2060.91s -> 2062.99s]  Like it happens so much
[2064.83s -> 2068.23s]  Between the like League streamers and non like just it's not even a big thing
[2068.23s -> 2070.23s]  It's just that we're in the League community right so you see it more
[2070.75s -> 2072.27s]  dude, like
[2072.27s -> 2074.51s]  well, the the drama is like a
[2074.51s -> 2080.83s]  a decent-sized League streamer who was like getting bigger or whatever like the AD carry streamer cookie bowl or whatever
[2081.11s -> 2084.27s]  He was like somebody made a 90 page
[2086.03s -> 2088.03s]  90 pages of
[2088.39s -> 2094.40s]  Google Doc to basically like expose this guy for like
[2095.00s -> 2097.52s]  Talking a bunch like sexually to underage girls
[2098.16s -> 2103.64s]  Not paying as fucking like mods who do work for him and like other stuff and I'm like, dude
[2104.32s -> 2113.44s]  Yeah, how man?
[2113.44s -> 2122.30s]  Like just be a normal human. It's not that bad like I take it from me
[2122.72s -> 2125.36s]  Being a normal dude. It's not that bad
[2200.21s -> 2202.21s]  Sorry, I was distracted. No, uh
[2202.73s -> 2208.13s]  Yeah, I don't know man. I I swear to God if people are just stupid as fuck people were idiots
[2210.13s -> 2215.53s]  There's got to be some psychological underlying issue with people's brains not working but it is what it is
[2216.21s -> 2221.26s]  Huh? I've had this bar cut account for a while
[2221.26s -> 2223.26s]  Oh
[2225.16s -> 2230.95s]  Dude what is the head Tarek skin?
[2233.92s -> 2237.52s]  See this. We just Tarek skin man. He's fabulous
[2238.72s -> 2240.56s]  damn
[2240.56s -> 2242.56s]  My man's just straight-up fabulous
[2243.16s -> 2258.24s]  people are desperate I
[2258.48s -> 2263.84s]  Just can't like I don't think like I've been in a situation where I was like a really really big streamer
[2264.28s -> 2268.90s]  Like much bigger than he is and I got like I this is what I'm saying
[2268.90s -> 2275.38s]  like I understand like all of the crap that gets thrown at you like people will literally
[2275.38s -> 2280.90s]  message you for no reason like you do have like fans that have like when I was at my
[2280.90s -> 2286.10s]  biggest point like you you have fans that are younger girls guys it doesn't matter and
[2286.10s -> 2290.02s]  like you just gotta like I just never in my mind I guess thought like oh I'm gonna flirt
[2290.02s -> 2294.82s]  with these people like it made me like I don't even I wouldn't even I literally didn't
[2294.82s -> 2308.92s]  even see them as like sexual in my brain like it blows my mind and then the fact that like
[2308.92s -> 2314.36s]  if you like if you look at the google doc or whatever the fact that like taco like i keep
[2314.36s -> 2318.28s]  a taco whatever it was literally talking to him telling him he was doing it like what he
[2318.28s -> 2321.96s]  was doing was wrong he was like yeah i get it right then he did it again
[2333.26s -> 2339.74s]  dude the set ulting the pussy that i'll be honest that may be one of the funniest lines
[2339.74s -> 2358.50s]  have ever heard like dude i mean whatever you know i'm not here to kink shame whatever gets
[2358.50s -> 2362.42s]  people off you know maybe maybe maybe that's a fetish i don't know
[2395.13s -> 2403.08s]  safe and sounds either way don't worry we cannot talk about the drama real quick
[2403.08s -> 2426.71s]  We could talk about how old and washed up Wings of Death is though.
[2426.71s -> 2427.71s]  I'm kidding.
[2427.71s -> 2436.43s]  Yo, did you see on a lighter note though, did you see Riot?
[2436.43s -> 2439.73s]  There was like a Reddit thread or something where Riot was saying that they're like
[2439.73s -> 2444.73s]  gonna try and do something about smurfing in the next few months.
[2444.73s -> 2458.33s]  I don't know what that means, but can you tell us something involving Wings?
[2458.33s -> 2459.33s]  Just between us.
[2459.33s -> 2460.65s]  Yeah, yeah, just between us and all the homies.
[2460.65s -> 2461.65s]  Yeah, yeah, in chat.
[2461.65s -> 2463.65s]  Nobody else say anything. It's fine. Yeah, no
[2467.22s -> 2468.42s]  What's up?
[2468.42s -> 2480.66s]  My chat ain't snitches
[2480.66s -> 2503.42s]  When I was a teen, I made a montage of him having breakdowns in my games. Oh my god
[2504.18s -> 2506.18s]  That's amazing. Oh
[2510.34s -> 2517.06s]  My god, that's amazing. I feel like I need to pay you to see this montage
[2518.10s -> 2520.10s]  Like I will give you money
[2521.30s -> 2546.89s]  Like I I need this this is important to me. Oh, I have a dude you should see that
[2546.89s -> 2549.53s]  I I have so many rage compilations about me. It's crazy
[2550.69s -> 2567.27s]  So many I had a I had a villain arc for sure. I feel you just comes with like being a league streamer
[2567.83s -> 2577.36s]  But you players are not all mentally healthy. Let me let me tell you
[2580.98s -> 2582.38s]  Take it from me
[2582.38s -> 2591.83s]  And okay, I'd like to think I'm not a villain anymore
[2592.81s -> 2607.74s]  Fuck you. I really want this plate
[2610.34s -> 2626.42s]  Dude a Nivea's roaming. Why is there Wukong just sitting top by the way?
[2626.42s -> 2637.29s]  Yeah, that's actually hilarious.
[2637.29s -> 2643.78s]  You know what's interesting?
[2643.78s -> 2646.98s]  I feel like Taric actually missed that stun.
[2646.98s -> 2671.98s]  I was kind of side-eyeing that, but I feel like he missed that stun somehow.
[2671.98s -> 2675.14s]  I feel like this is the easiest game I've ever played, by the way.
[2675.14s -> 2679.98s]  I'm on full autopilot, brain still waking up, and I feel like they're just walking
[2679.98s -> 2681.98s]  into me on repeat and I'm just killing them all.
[2681.98s -> 2686.02s]  I don't even know what the fuck's going on.
[2686.02s -> 2690.78s]  They it feels like the enemy team has not like they didn't they didn't like understand we were playing League
[2691.22s -> 2693.68s]  Right like they queued up and they were like, oh, yeah, this is League
[2694.94s -> 2696.94s]  That's what this feels like
[2697.58s -> 2700.78s]  This is what I imagine if like Mike Tyson went into a preschool, you know what I mean?
[2700.78s -> 2721.76s]  like this is what this feels like
[2721.76s -> 2723.76s]  much say I
[2733.66s -> 2735.66s]  probably could have killed those guys but I
[2736.94s -> 2749.35s]  Don't want to the chill I'm assuming the Wukong is gonna come bot soon
[2754.42s -> 2762.23s]  There is
[2762.23s -> 2769.83s]  Dammit I quenched late. I actually killed both. That was a late cleanse by me. My bad.
[2771.83s -> 2773.83s]  I don't want to take the risk of coming back up.
[2774.81s -> 2779.43s]  She stuns me they can one-shot me. I should have killed the fucking guy though.
[2780.95s -> 2785.23s]  The Wukong. I just backed up too far and then I cleansed the stun for like really late.
[2786.23s -> 2797.00s]  Hi Jera. Hey what's up man? What's up boys?
[2797.00s -> 2802.08s]  Good evening. Good evening. Good morning. I don't know where the fuck you guys live. So good day
[2815.11s -> 2816.95s]  Fuck am I watching?
[2816.95s -> 2827.75s]  Wait that wukong lived
[2828.03s -> 2837.10s]  Whoa, bro. Oh, I'm dead
[2839.18s -> 2841.18s]  Dude that wall was BS
[2843.18s -> 2847.26s]  There was like a little hole and then I flashed late because I was like, oh I could walk out the hole
[2847.78s -> 2849.78s]  But I couldn't walk out the tiny little hole
[2852.50s -> 2854.42s]  motherfuckers I
[2854.42s -> 2862.59s]  Shouldn't have even been there, but like I'm stupid. I just push bot
[2862.59s -> 2866.43s]  I was like, dude, that's such a bad fight, but I walked over to it. I was like, I'm really fat
[2867.55s -> 2870.87s]  honestly, I probably could have killed him if I didn't if I like flashed the
[2872.07s -> 2876.90s]  Done. Annie stuns the only
[2877.98s -> 2883.70s]  Like most over like I swear if they reduced Annie's done by like 0.5 seconds. She would never get played
[2885.00s -> 2886.56s]  like actually
[2886.56s -> 2890.00s]  The only reason to play Annie is her stun is just so OP
[2890.76s -> 2896.86s]  Because it's like a it's like the reason they changed Eric so long ago. We're like when you have a point click CC
[2900.30s -> 2902.42s]  It's typically really broken
[2911.14s -> 2913.14s]  Okay, I'm just dead
[2913.66s -> 2915.92s]  Does Terek not have old leveled up at six?
[2916.62s -> 2923.45s]  He didn't level his ulti
[2940.62s -> 2942.90s]  Maybe it's maybe terrible. It sucks
[2944.97s -> 2946.97s]  Maybe it's underpowered, you know
[2948.69s -> 2959.10s]  Now yeah, he must have misclicked
[2959.10s -> 2962.54s]  Honestly, I'm just briefing. I'm like playing to aggro for like
[2963.56s -> 2966.18s]  Like I I threw my lead because I was like, oh shit
[2966.18s -> 2971.04s]  I'm gonna walk over and help the homies you never walk over and help the homies when the homies are getting shit on because
[2972.30s -> 2976.94s]  if you have like 900 gold or a thousand gold lead like I did or whatever you don't want to do that because
[2977.74s -> 2980.14s]  You'll give MF a ton of kills
[2981.02s -> 2985.36s]  We're in a good spot now, though
[2985.52s -> 2996.06s]  But I am still a little
[2996.22s -> 2998.22s]  Wait, Tarek. Oh, he leveled the Zoltunners
[3000.53s -> 3002.97s]  This Taric does not know how to play Taric by the way
[3003.65s -> 3007.15s]  He's thrown out his stun so awkwardly
[3007.83s -> 3013.91s]  That's okay, though. I mean, I apparently don't know how to play Draven. So
[3018.27s -> 3024.91s]  Can't really blame the guy. I
[3024.91s -> 3027.27s]  Mean you guys are doing dragon with no smite
[3031.21s -> 3046.69s]  But it seems like doing dragon with no smite. I mean we could fight these fights, but
[3048.29s -> 3052.16s]  It's like painful
[3052.16s -> 3057.59s]  We could easily fight these fights. I think a lot of it is just like
[3057.59s -> 3061.63s]  Like, Taric isn't confident enough to walk up and stun, right?
[3061.63s -> 3063.91s]  Like that's what I'm seeing the issue is.
[3063.91s -> 3066.91s]  He's doing the thing where like he's not, he doesn't have the confidence to actually
[3066.91s -> 3072.13s]  walk up since he's a melee champ.
[3072.13s -> 3077.85s]  So he's walking up and like taking half his health and it's making him nervous.
[3077.85s -> 3084.95s]  It happens a lot with players who aren't very melee champ centric because melee supports
[3084.95s -> 3087.29s]  are actually pretty risky or they're pretty scary rather.
[3087.29s -> 3098.90s]  Oh, he's totally dead.
[3098.90s -> 3103.86s]  I don't remember not but yeah melee supports are scary to play uh because you have to know
[3105.38s -> 3108.10s]  when you can get a kill by going in because you're going to take damage right
[3110.02s -> 3119.95s]  that's just like the nature of melee supports nice we're coming back in a bit not bad
[3121.23s -> 3124.51s]  we threw a little bit early but yeah we're starting to get it back we're chilling
[3127.30s -> 3132.90s]  terics are never good i i'm always confused by teric because he feels like such a good
[3132.90s -> 3139.62s]  champion like the champion itself feels broken as shit like whatever whenever i see terik i think
[3139.62s -> 3151.78s]  to myself like he's either unkillably like super op or they're like oh and ten there's no in
[3151.78s -> 3155.06s]  between right like they either know how to play terik or they don't is what it feels like
[3169.44s -> 3172.56s]  oh you are i mean yeah yeah you are wrong terik actually requires mechanics
[3172.56s -> 3179.04s]  mechanics. That's actually true. Whereas like most supports like Nautilus doesn't have mechanics
[3179.04s -> 3183.40s]  you know. And like Blitzcrank doesn't have mechanics they just hit their button and
[3183.40s -> 3190.42s]  if it works they get a kill. Whereas like Taric after you stun there is like stuff
[3190.42s -> 3212.66s]  you have to do. That does make sense. Or block. Do you think um oh I'm gonna
[3212.66s -> 3222.03s]  die oh thank god do you think terics one of the harder supports i think he's i think he's
[3222.03s -> 3228.35s]  pretty hard like i don't think he's well i mean he's harder than the other supports
[3228.35s -> 3233.59s]  like i think like i don't think there's a single support that's hard i know i'm
[3233.59s -> 3257.56s]  i'm toxic for that but i stand by it whoa i mean i'm just gonna die i'm not gonna
[3257.56s -> 3263.12s]  try and flash i don't think i should have just flashed over but i kind of got baited
[3263.12s -> 3268.26s]  by the Terracult, I wanted to see if I could fight, but there's too much CC.
[3268.26s -> 3272.10s]  I was like, oh, he's ulting me, let's go.
[3272.10s -> 3276.52s]  I can tell this is a really low elo game, because there's so much random deaths, like,
[3276.52s -> 3281.12s]  I'm falling victim to like, I'm auto-piloting, and like, I'm not thinking, and I'm just
[3281.12s -> 3283.76s]  talking to you guys, and I'm just dying for free.
[3283.76s -> 3287.92s]  But it's like, there's so many people just dying for free, it's hilarious.
[3287.92s -> 3288.92s]  Thresh?
[3288.92s -> 3290.62s]  Thresh isn't actually that farmed.
[3290.62s -> 3296.18s]  So like a lot of people think like Thresh mechanically is very difficult because he is
[3296.18s -> 3300.26s]  harder than the other supports, but he's not actually that hard.
[3300.26s -> 3312.65s]  He's like, once you learn the Thresh combos, he's pretty much a very upfront champion.
[3312.65s -> 3321.20s]  Yeah, like, like lantern, for example, is one of the most broken things to ever
[3321.20s -> 3324.30s]  be put in League and everybody fucks it up.
[3324.30s -> 3328.22s]  people will will just mess up lantern because they'll throw it for souls or they'll mess it
[3328.22s -> 3335.74s]  like you can literally just hold lantern perma and your ad carry can walk up auto the turret
[3335.74s -> 3345.96s]  and and and you literally like they literally can't play the game after that like the enemy
[3345.96s -> 3351.66s]  team i'm in because like there's nothing they can do to stop it we can totally fight this
[3351.66s -> 3356.70s]  by the way so like i've done that before we're like my thresh well i know i have a good
[3356.70s -> 3359.20s]  Hold on, let me win this team fight really quick.
[3360.82s -> 3384.22s]  Give me a sec.
[3384.22s -> 3385.06s]  Okay, cool.
[3385.06s -> 3386.68s]  Sorry, I had to win that team fight real quick.
[3386.68s -> 3388.60s]  Okay, so as I was saying,
[3388.60s -> 3392.50s]  there's a lot more to Thresh than people think, right?
[3393.72s -> 3396.14s]  It's essentially, people over-complicate
[3396.14s -> 3397.90s]  what he needs to do.
[3397.90s -> 3399.56s]  So it's like, Thresh is a very basic,
[3399.56s -> 3401.28s]  like when you see Thresh in pro play,
[3401.28s -> 3403.12s]  you don't ever see what you do,
[3403.12s -> 3405.48s]  but it's very rare that you see the sick,
[3405.48s -> 3407.96s]  perma-looking, like, oh my God.
[3407.96s -> 3410.68s]  It's mainly like they pick him for like a lantern.
[3411.84s -> 3413.06s]  Straight up.
[3413.06s -> 3414.68s]  Like when they pick Thresh in high elo,
[3414.68s -> 3416.40s]  he's not picked to be the god tier,
[3416.40s -> 3419.76s]  like always landing perma CC hooks, like flay god.
[3419.76s -> 3422.82s]  Like he's picked to like shut down engage
[3422.82s -> 3427.42s]  and remove kill threat to your carries.
[3427.42s -> 3431.32s]  That's all he's picked for.
[3431.32s -> 3435.25s]  He's literally just an EW bot.
[3435.25s -> 3436.09s]  Armor stacking.
[3436.09s -> 3438.11s]  I mean, yeah, the armor thing on Thresh is nice,
[3438.11s -> 3442.83s]  but I wouldn't say it's like OP on his kit.
[3442.83s -> 3450.24s]  It just makes him not die to 80 carries in two seconds.
[3450.24s -> 3453.76s]  What is happening?
[3453.76s -> 3456.48s]  But I instantly know I'm playing with a good Thresh player
[3456.48s -> 3458.24s]  when I can walk up to the turret.
[3462.14s -> 3475.94s]  When I can walk up to the turret and the Thre-
[3475.94s -> 3478.18s]  Sorry, I was trying to think and talk at the same time.
[3478.18s -> 3479.22s]  When I can walk up to the turret,
[3479.22s -> 3480.58s]  my Thresh player won't walk up
[3480.58s -> 3481.78s]  and auto the turret with me.
[3481.78s -> 3484.30s]  That's like the sign of a good Thresh player.
[3484.30s -> 3486.22s]  When we don't know where the enemy is,
[3486.22s -> 3488.14s]  and instead of walking up and trying to hit the turret
[3488.14s -> 3489.58s]  to help you kill the turret,
[3489.58s -> 3492.12s]  they'll stand in the back and literally just sit there
[3492.12s -> 3494.16s]  and wait and hold lantern until,
[3497.24s -> 3500.10s]  they just hold their lantern until you can,
[3500.10s -> 3504.91s]  until you get ganked, essentially.
[3504.91s -> 3505.99s]  And that's why, like I said,
[3505.99s -> 3508.07s]  I just personally don't think Thresh has mechanics
[3508.07s -> 3509.85s]  are as hard as people think.
[3509.85s -> 3511.95s]  I do think he's very knowledge-based.
[3511.95s -> 3514.41s]  Like I think Thresh has high knowledge caps,
[3514.41s -> 3516.15s]  where like, if you're playing, I don't know,
[3516.15s -> 3520.31s]  like Lulu, your skill is basically like, do I W?
[3520.31s -> 3522.59s]  Your decision-making on Lulu is literally,
[3522.59s -> 3525.53s]  Do I W to speed or do I W to CC?
[3525.53s -> 3528.03s]  Right, like that's your decision making.
[3528.03s -> 3531.11s]  So it's like obviously much higher than that.
[3531.11s -> 3536.59s]  But it's, you son of a bitch.
[3536.59s -> 3538.57s]  But it's still not like that bad.
[3539.43s -> 3541.19s]  I think Thresh just intimidates people
[3541.19s -> 3543.99s]  because he can do so much.
[3544.87s -> 3546.91s]  And so I think people just get intimidated
[3546.91s -> 3548.55s]  because they think it looks overwhelming
[3548.55s -> 3554.10s]  to learn the champ.
[3554.10s -> 3556.18s]  I feel like that actually intimidates a lot of people
[3556.18s -> 3562.50s]  in terms of like people not wanting to learn new champions and shits. I feel like a lot
[3562.50s -> 3569.42s]  of it is just, um, people are nervous about learning champions that look overwhelming,
[3569.42s -> 3575.42s]  right? Like Aphelios for example, I was talking about this yesterday, Aphelios is
[3575.42s -> 3582.94s]  not a hard mechanical champion. Like, he's difficult in terms of the knowledge required,
[3582.94s -> 3586.30s]  Like he's knowledge gated very hard, right?
[3586.30s -> 3588.82s]  So like you have to play him a decent amount
[3588.82s -> 3592.26s]  or like research him to understand what guns do what,
[3592.26s -> 3594.74s]  how to interact with the guns, stuff like that, right?
[3594.74s -> 3597.78s]  But the actual mechanics of using the guns,
[3597.78s -> 3599.26s]  it's actually not hard.
[3600.62s -> 3614.11s]  Guys, what are we doing?
[3614.11s -> 3618.95s]  I guess we're just winning the fight.
[3618.95s -> 3621.75s]  Pyke?
[3621.75s -> 3626.60s]  Like, I think Pyke's harder than Thresh.
[3626.60s -> 3627.60s]  Maybe that's a hot take,
[3627.60s -> 3631.86s]  but I think Pyke is harder than Thresh.
[3631.86s -> 3634.50s]  because Pyke requires like really specific.
[3637.16s -> 3640.76s]  Pyke is a lot harder to play than he looks
[3641.84s -> 3643.24s]  when you see people play him.
[3644.88s -> 3647.68s]  Because there's like timers of when you can go in
[3647.68s -> 3649.26s]  off of certain things.
[3649.26s -> 3651.22s]  Like hitting his ulti consistently in team fights
[3651.22s -> 3653.52s]  is a little harder than people think.
[3653.52s -> 3656.50s]  And knowing how to position in the lane,
[3656.50s -> 3659.62s]  like Pyke is capable of a lot more than people think.
[3659.62s -> 3661.80s]  So I think Pyke's, I think the reason,
[3661.80s -> 3663.28s]  the main reason I think Pyke's a little harder
[3663.28s -> 3672.51s]  because he's melee like melee champions are always going to be like mechanically more difficult
[3672.51s -> 3681.86s]  than ranged if the melee champion is like you have to engage to go in and do stuff
[3681.86s -> 3691.58s]  because there's always the counterplay factor support role yeah that's what i'm saying
[3691.58s -> 3695.18s]  it's like i'm not saying overall like overall ranged champions require a lot more
[3695.18s -> 3699.34s]  mechanics than melee just because you're ranged you can die in a global and you
[3699.34s -> 3703.78s]  have to space and stuff but i think that like in just the support you support support
[3703.78s -> 3708.98s]  specific, I think melees are a lot harder to play. That's why you see a lot of like support players
[3710.34s -> 3714.02s]  we give like the best support players in the world are really good at like the engage melee
[3714.02s -> 3719.06s]  supports not the like enchanters and that's why you see like why we praise the best support
[3719.06s -> 3726.32s]  players because like when you see somebody go in like perfectly on Rakan or go in like
[3726.32s -> 3734.58s]  find a way in without getting knocked up on like I don't know something like when they find
[3734.58s -> 3736.58s]  the angle on Thresh and so it's really nice.
[3747.60s -> 3752.00s]  Rell? I think Rell sucks. I think that champ is so bad
[3753.18s -> 3759.76s]  because she just like... she doesn't do anything.
[3761.30s -> 3764.96s]  Like Rell's... Rell's initial thing was like she was supposed to go in,
[3765.84s -> 3770.52s]  be really tanky, and then be like a stun bot for like team fights. She was a team fight monster.
[3770.78s -> 3772.78s]  But the problem with Rell is like...
[3773.50s -> 3779.78s]  She has one chance essentially in lane phase like if anybody has fingers on their hands and they can move left and right
[3780.26s -> 3786.32s]  Rell's really easy to dodge like it's actually it's incredibly easy to beat a Rell in lane to not die to her
[3786.94s -> 3790.38s]  Like you just have to move left and right, right? It's very simple
[3790.54s -> 3798.92s]  So it's like it's much more difficult to dodge like other engaged champs if that makes sense like Nautilus
[3798.92s -> 3802.14s]  You can still move left and right but it's like he can walk at you while it's happening
[3802.14s -> 3809.58s]  Whereas like if Rell walks at you, I'm still like just waiting for the animation and then I can simply move to the left
[3810.32s -> 3812.18s]  because like her
[3812.18s -> 3818.34s]  Animation is so slow on using her ability that I can like dash I can flash I can there's so much counter play
[3818.34s -> 3822.98s]  And it's like unless she flashes on you, but it's even then you can tell she's gonna flash on you
[3822.98s -> 3824.66s]  so it's like I
[3824.66s -> 3827.88s]  Also feel like mid game Rell has this issue where?
[3827.88s -> 3834.78s]  She has her one trick ulti engage fight in teamfights, but after she does that she does literally nothing
[3836.91s -> 3843.66s]  Right. She's like a one and done. That's why I like she feels like she doesn't have other expression
[3844.06s -> 3852.70s]  She's countered so hard by the meta too
[3853.62s -> 3855.62s]  milio counters rel engage
[3856.56s -> 3858.56s]  Thresh counters rel engage
[3858.96s -> 3860.18s]  right like
[3860.18s -> 3877.20s]  Either either of those champions shits on rel engage and you can't do anything. Like I don't know if you've ever tried to play rel
[3877.20s -> 3888.36s]  gone in and been like thresh flayed but it's the worst feeling it's a bad feeling it's like when
[3888.36s -> 3893.64s]  people play leona it's the same reason leona's shit right now like they both have the same
[3893.64s -> 3898.76s]  idea of why they're bad right they like have they're both good at doing what they're supposed
[3898.76s -> 3903.48s]  to do like you know stun and create pressure and point click and shit but the problem is is
[3903.48s -> 3910.36s]  like you can easily counter pick them so incredibly hard that they just become worthless the whole
[3910.36s -> 3918.73s]  game. Have you ever gotten Senna's secondary mission? Oh all the time. With Senna being
[3918.73s -> 3922.33s]  like with Thresh being meta and Senna being like a champion I'm playing a lot, I get
[3922.33s -> 3929.41s]  that all the time. You don't even notice it though, I'm gonna be real. When you
[3929.41s -> 3932.01s]  kill the Thresh or whatever and you get his souls you don't even fucking notice
[3932.01s -> 3940.29s]  it because like it's like 40 armor and it's like you're level 17 or some shit
[3940.29s -> 3945.81s]  at that point like at the point you're getting it you're such a high level that like the
[3945.81s -> 3949.01s]  40 random armor like it's nice but I never really notice it.
[3949.01s -> 3958.74s]  Trying to get your teammates ahead isn't that good?
[3958.74s -> 3962.66s]  You know what I've actually been doing uh as support on my main account?
[3962.66s -> 3976.37s]  I've actually been roaming non-stop and it's super OP because the key to roaming
[3976.37s -> 3984.09s]  is all you have to do to roam well is literally be there one or two times in the first five
[3984.09s -> 3990.33s]  minutes of the game to completely fuck over the enemy one time on an engage or something
[3990.33s -> 3998.66s]  and they get so far behind from it that you can literally just walk back bot.
[3998.66s -> 4000.04s]  Like I do it on Senna.
[4000.04s -> 4001.24s]  Like I'll push bot lane.
[4001.24s -> 4002.24s]  This is my strategy on Senna.
[4002.24s -> 4004.00s]  I'm gonna give it to you guys, okay?
[4004.00s -> 4008.44s]  So I don't know if this works in low elo but in like masters, like high masters
[4008.44s -> 4014.94s]  this works at least. This is all I do on Senna. Every single player I play against on Senna,
[4014.94s -> 4018.98s]  every single one except for like Pyke players, even Nautilus, Blitz, they all concede lane
[4018.98s -> 4024.50s]  level 1. Every single one of them. They just let me push level 1. And so I'll
[4024.50s -> 4029.94s]  push the waves in level 1, and I'll either crash wave 2 or wave 3 depending on how
[4029.94s -> 4035.10s]  far they're giving me like push power, right? So I will always crash wave 2 or
[4035.10s -> 4047.52s]  three bot and I will immediately roam mid every time. And even if I don't get a kill, usually
[4047.52s -> 4054.86s]  it fucks over the enemy mid laner so badly because on that exact timer, there's usually
[4054.86s -> 4063.56s]  a gank happening on mid. So a lot of the time people think that you're roaming to
[4063.56s -> 4066.24s]  to get a kill for the laner, you're not.
[4066.24s -> 4069.26s]  You're roaming to counter pressure
[4069.26s -> 4073.59s]  from the other players in the game.
[4073.59s -> 4075.09s]  How many times have you guys been like,
[4075.09s -> 4077.95s]  oh, we can win this 2v2, you see the enemy jungler,
[4077.95s -> 4078.93s]  your jungler comes, you're like,
[4078.93s -> 4080.19s]  oh, we're gonna bait this.
[4080.19s -> 4081.67s]  And then all of a sudden the support shows up
[4081.67s -> 4083.35s]  and you're like, God damn it.
[4083.35s -> 4085.83s]  And then you die and you're like, what the fuck?
[4085.83s -> 4088.79s]  That right there is how easy it is to play support.
[4088.79s -> 4093.71s]  Because all you have to do is show up once, twice.
[4093.71s -> 4102.26s]  And now that entire lane is fucked for the enemy team.
[4102.26s -> 4103.98s]  Roaming is so easy.
[4103.98s -> 4106.78s]  The only thing, people fuck up roaming really bad
[4106.78s -> 4108.40s]  when they roam on timers
[4108.40s -> 4111.30s]  where their AD carry can't safely farm.
[4111.30s -> 4113.66s]  So what ends up happening is on that timer, right?
[4113.66s -> 4116.30s]  Where like I told you wave two, three, right?
[4116.30s -> 4119.56s]  What happens is you push that wave in, you roam mid.
[4119.56s -> 4121.14s]  Let's say nothing happens, okay?
[4121.14s -> 4123.30s]  I can just walk back bot.
[4123.30s -> 4125.10s]  It's, you lose nothing.
[4125.10s -> 4126.74s]  And if usually at that point you're not,
[4126.74s -> 4127.86s]  you have like 300 gold,
[4127.86s -> 4129.46s]  So there's no point in backing, right?
[4129.46s -> 4133.06s]  Now let's say like, I noticed that my jungler is like
[4133.06s -> 4136.26s]  invading top side, I just walk over to top and help him.
[4137.50s -> 4140.34s]  Because you have like three to four,
[4140.34s -> 4141.94s]  you have like three to four waves
[4141.94s -> 4143.54s]  before the enemy bot lane,
[4143.54s -> 4150.76s]  the enemy bot lane has to play it almost perfectly
[4150.76s -> 4154.38s]  to be able to abuse your roam on certain timers.
[4155.86s -> 4157.26s]  They essentially have to play it perfect
[4157.26s -> 4158.78s]  to abuse the roam.
[4158.78s -> 4160.46s]  What I mean by that is like,
[4160.46s -> 4163.10s]  The way, the best way to abuse support roaming
[4163.10s -> 4166.74s]  is you either A, if you have the ability to dive,
[4166.74s -> 4171.06s]  you can pretty much A, immediately dive,
[4171.06s -> 4173.22s]  like push the next wave and then immediately dive
[4173.22s -> 4174.42s]  if you like have that ability,
[4174.42s -> 4176.34s]  say you're playing Leona Dravid or something.
[4176.34s -> 4178.14s]  But even then it's a little risky
[4178.14s -> 4180.14s]  because then the AD carry can just walk back
[4180.14s -> 4182.50s]  and they only lose one wave and you gave up,
[4182.50s -> 4183.90s]  you know, a stack chance.
[4183.90s -> 4185.18s]  So it's not that bad.
[4185.18s -> 4188.46s]  Two, you can stack the wave.
[4188.46s -> 4191.68s]  Now, stacking the wave is the best way to counter it,
[4191.68s -> 4194.24s]  because let's say I'm roaming for an extended period,
[4194.24s -> 4196.00s]  you stack like a three wave,
[4196.00s -> 4197.68s]  and then all of a sudden you're crashing it,
[4197.68s -> 4199.10s]  and then you wanna, like you're up a level,
[4199.10s -> 4200.40s]  because you've been gaining XP,
[4200.40s -> 4202.28s]  and the AD carry has to back off.
[4202.28s -> 4203.80s]  But the way to counter that,
[4203.80s -> 4206.60s]  is you simply just walk back on the timer
[4206.60s -> 4208.44s]  of the stacked wave crashing as an AD carry,
[4208.44s -> 4209.68s]  or as a support.
[4209.68s -> 4211.74s]  It's so incredibly easy to do.
[4211.74s -> 4213.64s]  It's actually brainlessly easy to do.
[4214.48s -> 4216.26s]  Like, it's literally,
[4216.26s -> 4222.68s]  You can roam all you want bot lane as long as you are in bot lane for the stacked wave crashes
[4222.68s -> 4231.45s]  Or you are in bot lane when your jungler is bot side of the map. It's easy as fuck
[4233.71s -> 4236.03s]  But support players drool on themselves
[4236.59s -> 4238.59s]  So they like to essentially
[4240.03s -> 4246.11s]  Support players like to like afk in the lane phase. They like to literally sit there and just do nothing
[4247.79s -> 4251.95s]  That's like the average support I see is they will stand and do nothing
[4252.15s -> 4259.22s]  And and I've said this before but I'll say it again being a good support is not being a better player than the enemy team
[4259.50s -> 4262.26s]  Being a good support is queuing up to play League of Legends
[4263.66s -> 4269.00s]  That's that's all it takes all it takes to be a good support is queuing up with the intent to push buttons in
[4269.00s -> 4270.32s]  the game and
[4270.32s -> 4499.80s]  Not just afk. All right, I'm back
[4500.78s -> 4502.78s]  What's up? I?
[4502.98s -> 4506.14s]  Don't remember what we're talking about. Oh supports. Yeah, they're all stupid
[4506.14s -> 4515.77s]  don't afk on support you'll gain LP so it's that it's actually that easy
[4515.77s -> 4532.29s]  honestly I don't think supports are stupid I think it's more of a how do I
[4532.29s -> 4538.70s]  phrase this it's in my opinion it's more of like they're like they've
[4538.70s -> 4546.59s]  never they don't have to learn support players like don't have to
[4546.59s -> 4551.39s]  learn important things because they can get away with not doing it so
[4551.39s -> 4553.31s]  they get they develop bad habits that's all it is
[4553.31s -> 4564.61s]  Do you have a Spotify playlist?
[4564.61s -> 4569.54s]  Yeah.
[4569.54s -> 4572.06s]  Best roll to climb?
[4572.06s -> 4573.58s]  I think every roll is good to climb.
[4573.58s -> 4575.62s]  As long as you're good.
[4575.62s -> 4576.62s]  Classic Jara.
[4576.62s -> 4578.46s]  Oh, I don't see whatever you linked.
[4578.46s -> 4583.10s]  I don't allow links in the chat because I had to turn them off a long time ago.
[4583.10s -> 4590.34s]  So I can't see it.
[4590.34s -> 4593.84s]  I would say though, climbing is just about like whatever, because every roll you can
[4593.84s -> 4594.84s]  climb on, right?
[4594.84s -> 4596.16s]  Like every single roll.
[4596.16s -> 4606.14s]  So climbing a lot of the time is just about what you think is most fun for you and you
[4606.14s -> 4613.74s]  get the best at. I would say objectively the best roles to climb on are jungle and support
[4613.74s -> 4619.74s]  for just like higher elo. Well, jungle and lower elo, support and higher elo.
[4621.34s -> 4626.06s]  I wouldn't climb on support in like gold because you're not going to have a good time
[4626.06s -> 4632.54s]  trying to like help bad players play the game. Bad, that's mean. People who don't like,
[4632.54s -> 4637.54s]  You can get like a gold Ezreal 30 kills by being the better support, but you won't always win
[4637.98s -> 4644.10s]  Whereas like if you really want to control solo queue and your teammates aren't like good enough to carry at that level
[4644.26s -> 4650.86s]  By themselves right like you get frustrated just pick something that has more agency in the game
[4651.34s -> 4661.42s]  You lost 18 of 24 as jungle you want to try a new role?
[4661.42s -> 4665.54s]  I mean you can play AD if if you think it's AD carry is
[4666.54s -> 4668.62s]  Interesting I wouldn't say it's like fun
[4668.62s -> 4682.82s]  but it's not it's not bad you're in gold I mean you could try it my view on it is
[4682.82s -> 4685.98s]  if people were wondering if they want to play a role or not my view is just try
[4685.98s -> 4688.58s]  it see if you like it because if you don't like the role you're not gonna
[4688.58s -> 4691.62s]  be able to put in enough games to get good at the role right so like
[4691.62s -> 4695.58s]  just give it a try see if you enjoy it or not and if like it's not fun
[4695.58s -> 4698.98s]  then if it's not your play style it's not fun because 80s are very
[4698.98s -> 4705.58s]  unique playstyle from all the other roles like they're the reason people don't
[4705.58s -> 4709.98s]  like playing ad carry and like like watching ad carry streamers and shit is
[4709.98s -> 4720.33s]  because it ad carry is like it's boring ad carries like zero like like if
[4720.33s -> 4722.99s]  there was a graph of shit going on when you're playing ad carry in the
[4722.99s -> 4726.29s]  game it's like this there's like spikes to a hundred and then it's
[4726.29s -> 4737.18s]  back to like this, right? It's like, AD Carry is a lot of, every game is different, right?
[4737.18s -> 4743.90s]  Every game when you play AD is different, because you're always with a different player,
[4743.90s -> 4748.30s]  like a different support unless you duo queue. So every AD Carry game is different, coupled
[4748.30s -> 4753.38s]  with you spend a lot of the game just farming. Like you don't get to interact
[4753.38s -> 4758.02s]  with the enemy a lot. So you just kind of farm a lot of the game, and even then
[4758.02s -> 4761.42s]  you also like, you basically are farming
[4761.42s -> 4763.28s]  for like little dopamine hits of like team fights
[4763.28s -> 4764.58s]  and stuff that you get around the game.
[4764.58s -> 4768.74s]  So that's kind of fun.
[4768.74s -> 4770.20s]  But it's, like I said, it's all you.
[4770.20s -> 4771.88s]  You can climb on any roll.
[4771.88s -> 4774.48s]  I think AD carry requires the most mechanical skill
[4774.48s -> 4777.48s]  to climb because the difference between,
[4778.48s -> 4779.98s]  climbing as like a jungler is about being
[4779.98s -> 4781.32s]  in the right spot at the right time, right?
[4781.32s -> 4784.16s]  Like you need to path this way, get objectives, et cetera.
[4784.16s -> 4785.74s]  Climbing as an AD carry is more about like,
[4785.74s -> 4788.02s]  this person fucked up their positioning,
[4788.02s -> 4812.64s]  I'm gonna kill them type shit.
[4812.64s -> 4825.86s]  concerted Q. Also, I want to say something. If you are playing, make sure, and this is
[4825.86s -> 4830.82s]  just a really good standardized bit of advice, make sure you're always tracking what the
[4830.82s -> 4838.22s]  enemy cooldowns are, what their spells are, stuff like that. Okay? Because playing the
[4838.22s -> 4842.90s]  game is not just about farming and your team goes in and you auto and shit. Like
[4842.90s -> 4846.60s]  right now, mid's Mia, right? I can see that Varus is Mia, but it is a Varus,
[4846.60s -> 4851.84s]  So like I'm not too worried about being like level 2'd by Varus, not that much, right?
[4851.84s -> 4856.32s]  So I can kind of play backward because I know that it's a high chance he's not gonna
[4856.32s -> 4857.68s]  run bot at level 2 as a Varus.
[4857.68s -> 4861.02s]  Now if that was like a Fizz or some shit, I immediately back up.
[4861.02s -> 4864.84s]  So we notice that it's pretty obvious Rakan probably got W level 2, we don't know
[4864.84s -> 4868.34s]  what it is, but he has Q, so he doesn't have shield.
[4868.34s -> 4878.59s]  Which means, because he doesn't have shield, it's hard for the Rakan to get back out
[4878.59s -> 4880.87s]  if he fucks up on engage.
[4880.87s -> 4882.99s]  So you need to think about these type of things, right?
[4882.99s -> 4888.31s]  Now this is wave 4, I believe, and because it's wave 4, we're gonna get level 3 on wave
[4888.31s -> 4889.31s]  4.
[4889.31s -> 4894.35s]  You always get level 3 on wave 4 if you have full XP.
[4894.35s -> 4899.35s]  You get level 2 on wave 2, and you get level 3 on wave 4.
[4899.35s -> 4907.92s]  And these timers for when you get certain level ups, bot lane, are very important.
[4907.92s -> 4910.60s]  Now I'm gonna hover over here.
[4910.60s -> 4913.48s]  You see how Fiddle is right here?
[4913.48s -> 4917.96s]  I'm actually going to just walk in here and see if I can like, yeah, we see him.
[4918.02s -> 4918.52s]  Nice.
[4919.64s -> 4922.18s]  See, this is exactly what I was talking about before.
[4922.68s -> 4924.36s]  Do you see what my support is doing?
[4925.24s -> 4928.76s]  I, I left the lane guys.
[4929.28s -> 4932.00s]  I walked to, to like stand next to my jungler.
[4932.00s -> 4939.16s]  After we pushed the wave in my Lulu is hanging out by herself, bot lane.
[4941.58s -> 4942.58s]  But she's just chilling.
[4958.73s -> 4959.61s]  You don't want to do that.
[4960.57s -> 4965.45s]  You don't ever want to be the guy who's like by yourself bot lane as a support
[4966.71s -> 4967.95s]  because
[4967.95s -> 4973.81s]  You don't like supports don't need gold, right? Not really and you don't need farm. You don't need all that shit
[4973.81s -> 4977.69s]  So if you're ad carry roams and unless the wave is fucked and they're just being stupid
[4977.69s -> 4980.69s]  You have to fix the wave or something. You don't want to be by yourself in the lane
[4981.25s -> 4988.13s]  It just doesn't do anything. How do I not auto a tower? Oh, I used
[4988.13s -> 4994.11s]  uh, Tilda. So there's a way, there's actually a setting you can have in the game where when
[4994.11s -> 5000.09s]  you hit a button, it makes it so that I can't physically hit anything but a champion. It's
[5000.09s -> 5004.69s]  target, it's called target champions only. And it's basically like, here, I'll do it
[5004.69s -> 5007.61s]  for you right now. Watch. You see how like I can hit the tower. You see how
[5007.61s -> 5014.33s]  it's the red sword. So when I hit this button, I can no longer hit the tower or
[5014.33s -> 5022.29s]  the minions, but I can still hit the champions. So essentially when you're fighting in a big
[5022.29s -> 5027.53s]  minion wave or you're fighting under a turret and you don't want to misclick, you just
[5027.53s -> 5032.13s]  hit target champions only button and it makes it a thousand times easier because
[5032.13s -> 5048.29s]  you can literally only hit the champion. It's really nice. And you can make the
[5048.29s -> 5057.94s]  button anything you want obviously. I just, I use Tilda, it's the default. I actually
[5057.94s -> 5063.40s]  want to kill these guys but I need to wait for the wave to push out just a hair the jungler
[5063.40s -> 5066.32s]  could be bought but it is a fiddlestick so it's like I don't really care about a fiddlesticks
[5066.32s -> 5082.77s]  being bought we can straight up just kill them okay well apparently we can't kill
[5082.77s -> 5092.38s]  them because apparently my Lulu didn't want to walk up that's so frustrating
[5092.38s -> 5099.18s]  man I did fuck up my uh my auto there but I am a little I I am kind of curious
[5099.18s -> 5102.90s]  what happens I'd have to go watch the VOD I fucked up my kill in the Xayah I
[5102.90s -> 5105.40s]  I think I walked to left instead or down.
[5105.40s -> 5107.00s]  My movement was bad.
[5107.00s -> 5108.78s]  Like essentially when they fought, right?
[5108.78s -> 5110.04s]  I walked like this.
[5110.04s -> 5112.00s]  I should have walked like this
[5112.00s -> 5115.00s]  because you want to cut off the Xayah from the gank.
[5115.00s -> 5118.08s]  Now I do think when Lulu just blindly ran away,
[5118.08s -> 5119.82s]  I think she kind of griefed.
[5119.82s -> 5121.56s]  You don't need to insta run from ganks,
[5121.56s -> 5123.12s]  especially when like, you could see what I have, right?
[5123.12s -> 5124.42s]  I have Dirk and Sheen.
[5125.64s -> 5127.64s]  Something that a lot of people do as well
[5127.64s -> 5130.08s]  is they will see that like the numbers are uneven
[5130.08s -> 5131.32s]  and they'll instantly run away.
[5131.32s -> 5133.08s]  They don't think about like how to win the fight
[5133.08s -> 5135.72s]  or like what the win con is of the fight.
[5135.72s -> 5137.32s]  Cause that's what I was saying before we got ganked, right?
[5137.32s -> 5138.80s]  I was like, Fiddle can't gank us.
[5138.80s -> 5139.64s]  And he can't.
[5139.64s -> 5141.42s]  Pre-six, Fiddle does nothing in the gank.
[5141.42s -> 5143.30s]  I had cleanse.
[5143.30s -> 5145.80s]  They don't actually beat us in 3v2.
[5145.80s -> 5148.16s]  So the problem was is we weren't focusing
[5148.16s -> 5149.00s]  the same target.
[5149.00s -> 5152.00s]  I went for the Xayah and she backed really far up.
[5152.00s -> 5154.80s]  Now if we had played forward a bit,
[5154.80s -> 5156.74s]  like say she played a little more forward with me,
[5156.74s -> 5157.58s]  that would have gone a lot better.
[5157.58s -> 5159.60s]  Or if I had played a little more back with her,
[5159.60s -> 5161.48s]  It was basically like we don't have comms,
[5161.48s -> 5165.34s]  so it got rough.
[5165.34s -> 5168.86s]  Now Fiddle is six now, so it's a little scary.
[5169.78s -> 5171.30s]  I don't like playing versus Fiddle sticks
[5171.30s -> 5174.70s]  for the reason of like 90% of the time,
[5174.70s -> 5176.98s]  players don't know how to ward around Fiddle.
[5176.98s -> 5180.81s]  People put wards in weird spots.
[5180.81s -> 5182.17s]  We should have won that fight though.
[5182.17s -> 5192.36s]  I'm a little salty, mainly myself.
[5192.36s -> 5194.92s]  So this too, Lulu keeps speeding me up.
[5197.80s -> 5198.76s]  I'm gonna be honest with you,
[5198.76s -> 5203.85s]  I don't like when Lulu's do that.
[5203.85s -> 5205.15s]  It's like a pet peeve thing of mine
[5205.15s -> 5207.29s]  when Lulu's use their speed.
[5207.29s -> 5209.69s]  Like I'm okay with it if I need to dodge something
[5209.69s -> 5211.11s]  or I need to chase somebody,
[5211.11s -> 5212.93s]  but I think it's just so much less value
[5212.93s -> 5215.53s]  than using it to CC early game.
[5215.53s -> 5217.73s]  Early game, the CC of Lulu,
[5217.73s -> 5220.13s]  like using W is so broken to me
[5220.13s -> 5222.25s]  because they just physically can't move their character
[5222.25s -> 5232.06s]  for like 1.5 seconds, which is crazy.
[5232.06s -> 5233.16s]  I think Fiddle's bot.
[5233.16s -> 5238.66s]  You can kind of tell.
[5238.66s -> 5241.34s]  You see how they're playing really aggressive?
[5241.34s -> 5243.54s]  They don't beat us 2v2.
[5243.54s -> 5247.18s]  So I'm thinking, and they just cleared this ward out.
[5247.18s -> 5253.42s]  I'm thinking Fiddle is either on dragon or he's bush ganking bot somewhere.
[5253.42s -> 5258.12s]  So I don't really want to walk up.
[5258.12s -> 5260.48s]  You see how this guy is confidently hitting the turret?
[5260.48s -> 5262.78s]  This is making me think Fiddle's trying to lane gank.
[5262.78s -> 5269.88s]  Because they cannot beat us 2v2.
[5269.88s -> 5273.58s]  Like I think Fiddle's in here.
[5273.58s -> 5277.54s]  So I'm actually just going to play Thane until we see him on the map.
[5277.54s -> 5278.54s]  I don't know.
[5278.54s -> 5293.53s]  I'm not going to take the chance because you got to think about like what you see
[5293.53s -> 5295.25s]  and what you don't see on the map.
[5295.25s -> 5297.35s]  Like we can't physically see Fiddle, right?
[5297.35s -> 5298.35s]  But think about this.
[5298.35s -> 5299.75s]  We don't see him top.
[5299.75s -> 5300.87s]  That's something you have to think about.
[5300.87s -> 5305.79s]  We had a ward on Rift just now for 15 seconds, right?
[5305.79s -> 5308.07s]  We didn't see him top.
[5308.07s -> 5313.24s]  So like if he's not top, where is he?
[5313.24s -> 5315.66s]  Now I think he finally left.
[5315.66s -> 5320.41s]  This looks like he went to dragon.
[5320.41s -> 5330.08s]  Yeah.
[5330.08s -> 5332.88s]  What are we doing by the way?
[5332.88s -> 5336.40s]  I mean I guess I'm just gonna die.
[5336.40s -> 5338.88s]  Now would be the time to speed me.
[5338.88s -> 5341.36s]  I mean I don't even know what to say about that.
[5341.36s -> 5346.62s]  Malzahar just didn't walk.
[5346.62s -> 5352.16s]  Gragas didn't flash his E. Malzahar didn't walk.
[5352.16s -> 5353.78s]  You always walk there by the way.
[5353.78s -> 5355.46s]  I want to make this clear.
[5355.46s -> 5360.52s]  If you're a mid laner, and you're playing a late game scaling mid, you always walk to
[5360.52s -> 5364.88s]  the fight no matter what though, if it's at, if it's going, if it's doing that.
[5364.88s -> 5368.36s]  Okay, guys.
[5368.36s -> 5374.92s]  We need to walk to fights, and Lulu, you need to follow up when I go in.
[5374.92s -> 5378.00s]  Don't run.
[5378.00s -> 5380.48s]  I'm just gonna type it because I'm actually fucking annoyed.
[5380.48s -> 5383.75s]  I'm a little frustrated.
[5383.75s -> 5387.27s]  I still think the game is 100% winnable, but I'm playing Draven.
[5387.27s -> 5391.07s]  We're playing like I'm playing fucking Ezreal or some shit.
[5391.07s -> 5395.31s]  And I can't walk up because essentially, we know Fiddle was bot for the last 2-3 minutes,
[5395.31s -> 5396.31s]  right?
[5396.31s -> 5405.21s]  He just sat down there.
[5405.21s -> 5406.21s]  What is my Lulu doing?
[5406.21s -> 5407.97s]  Bro, what are you doing?
[5407.97s -> 5412.56s]  No, we fight this.
[5412.56s -> 5413.56s]  Go.
[5413.56s -> 5420.39s]  Yeah, this guy doesn't get to do this for free.
[5420.39s -> 5423.65s]  Now they have a Galeforce, so I need to be a little care.
[5423.65s -> 5428.22s]  This guy has no ulti though.
[5428.22s -> 5431.56s]  Like this is what- I'm losing my minds, man.
[5431.56s -> 5442.22s]  Like dude just follow no what she was doing what she was trying to protect her ward
[5443.98s -> 5448.62s]  She saw the recon hitting the ward but the Zaya walked up to get a free to just die
[5448.98s -> 5458.70s]  The problem is my Lulu was like, oh, I don't want to give up my ward and she wasn't thinking please
[5459.86s -> 5461.86s]  Just sit with me. Okay
[5462.90s -> 5464.90s]  Yeah, sorry. I
[5465.10s -> 5467.10s]  Need you to follow me
[5467.54s -> 5469.54s]  always
[5469.62s -> 5474.42s]  Even if it looks scary, you gotta follow, okay?
[5483.49s -> 5489.89s]  Also, uh, one thing is there's actually not a lot of fighting that happens in lower elo, so
[5490.85s -> 5493.49s]  a lot of these players don't know how to fight early, because
[5494.13s -> 5498.29s]  one thing that I think has gotten really bad about League lately, just in the past few years,
[5499.01s -> 5504.69s]  is people don't ever limit test in League ever anymore. They always just play like pussies.
[5504.69s -> 5511.69s]  Every single player in League plays like a fucking pussy nowadays, and it's literally just like sad to see.
[5511.69s -> 5527.32s]  Like right there. Why aren't we W-ing? Use W on the Xayah. Not to speed.
[5527.32s -> 5536.59s]  Like, I'm losing my mind. Because all you have to do there is W the Xayah, she gets CC'd, we kill her on the W.
[5536.59s -> 5544.71s]  I'm telling you Lulu players are like hardwired for some reason to not play
[5544.71s -> 5564.70s]  correctly I'm never gonna catch this guy he's got gale force and tier 2 boots
[5564.70s -> 5573.69s]  yeah I mean I I have to go for it though cuz if I don't go for kills now
[5573.69s -> 5577.97s]  the game's over so it's either we go for it or we lose so I'm willing to
[5577.97s -> 5585.26s]  like look stupid honestly this game was my fault for the 1 2v3 that
[5585.26s -> 5588.70s]  happened early I misplayed it and if I didn't misplay that we would have
[5588.70s -> 5595.34s]  the game off it now the game's pretty much over like it's solo queue so we can always come back
[5595.34s -> 5600.94s]  but the problem is uh i don't think we have good enough players to come back like look at what
[5600.94s -> 5613.45s]  lulu's doing lulu why are you bot solo at the moment think like what is ah what are we doing
[5621.92s -> 5626.08s]  this is exactly what i was telling you guys it doesn't make sense remember when i told
[5626.08s -> 5631.92s]  you supports easy all you have to do is be a human remember what i said that 40 seconds or
[5631.92s -> 5638.78s]  four minutes ago before the game started all you have to do to play support is think push buttons
[5638.78s -> 5642.62s]  and be active in the game and if you can do those things you'll get challenger on support
[5646.57s -> 5671.87s]  like it blows my mind like look look what you did what are you doing this is a this is
[5671.87s -> 5692.20s]  a forfeit though i'm gonna lose my minds autofilled ad i'm gonna lose it my bad guess
[5692.20s -> 5695.40s]  I'm an autofilled AD, I'm just bad. It's on me. I apologize.
[5704.22s -> 5712.09s]  Oh man, these players are crazy. I'm actually really surprised we're just not forfeiting now.
[5715.42s -> 5719.34s]  The best way to play the game is something that like I fall victim to too, where I fuck
[5719.34s -> 5723.82s]  this up sometimes, right? But the best way to play the game a lot of the time is you
[5723.82s -> 5730.78s]  essentially don't play to take risks. I know it sounds silly because you got to find,
[5730.78s -> 5732.78s]  essentially you have to find the um
[5737.52s -> 5743.38s]  My Malzahar just let um, let this guy this 1000 gold walk away. Hey Malz
[5744.28s -> 5747.86s]  If you moved by the way, you get 1k gold
[5755.70s -> 5765.66s]  Mid isn't hard roll. I can mid in my sleep. It's not
[5766.48s -> 5780.28s]  AD is easiest roll. I'm AD carry streamer. I play AD but Lulu is
[5780.28s -> 5793.46s]  is small brain that was mean Lulu took some some crossfire there that she didn't need to take that
[5793.46s -> 5819.00s]  was my bad that was toxic I'll be real I think uh today is gonna be a mute all kind of day
[5819.00s -> 5823.80s]  listening to low elo players talk about the game and then they think that they're right
[5823.80s -> 5827.40s]  about the game and like how it works and all this shits it actually like hurts me
[5827.40s -> 5832.20s]  like it shouldn't I should just laugh it off but sometimes when I see a low elo player
[5832.20s -> 5838.10s]  Talk about how they think the game should be played and I just know that they're wrong. It actually like physically hurts me
[5841.71s -> 5843.71s]  It does it physically hurts
[5853.32s -> 5859.98s]  But I should follow my own rule where if you're playing with people that aren't as good like they don't see what you see
[5860.58s -> 5865.68s]  Right. There's like something where it's better to play safe and scale even on Draven
[5865.92s -> 5869.26s]  It's better to play safe and scale than to go for plays in lane
[5869.26s -> 5880.12s]  mainly because if you go for place in lane and let's say your support is not
[5880.12s -> 5884.14s]  as good as you or your supports not confident in their ability to 2v2 right
[5884.14s -> 5887.92s]  then you're just gonna lose so you're like forcing that person to be in an
[5887.92s -> 5893.54s]  uncomfortable situation so like it's hard for me as a player to just play
[5893.54s -> 5897.48s]  safe when I see the enemy making mistake after mistake it's like
[5897.48s -> 5901.56s]  something that I have trouble like personally working on right just like a
[5901.56s -> 5906.04s]  personal issue where like I'll see an enemy make a mistake positional wise I'm
[5906.04s -> 5908.88s]  like oh shit let's abuse this but a lot of the time the problem that
[5908.88s -> 5912.88s]  happens is you have somebody who doesn't know that that person made a
[5912.88s -> 5915.80s]  mistake or doesn't see the same mistake as me and because there's no
[5915.80s -> 5919.40s]  comms I can't relate to them that we should fight right so if I go in
[5919.40s -> 5922.84s]  and they don't know that we should be fighting there I I end up dying and
[5922.84s -> 5928.48s]  It looks it feels really bad, which is I mean
[5929.52s -> 5934.36s]  My fault. It's like a personal thing because you can't control your supports. You can only control yourself
[5935.00s -> 5937.52s]  It's just something that like I suck at doing sometimes
[5939.28s -> 5968.24s]  Right, so that's just on man. We could actually kill the Zyra now by the way, she's like 60% HP
[5969.00s -> 5995.71s]  Like we could kill her. What is my Gragas doing? Oh
[5997.35s -> 6005.26s]  He got her though nice, bro
[6006.18s -> 6008.18s]  Use w
[6008.50s -> 6010.50s]  To cc people
[6011.38s -> 6018.50s]  Not to speed people
[6018.50s -> 6020.50s]  That was a good example too. Oh, well
[6027.20s -> 6029.92s]  I just got to get better at doing that where I play safe though. That's on me
[6030.64s -> 6032.64s]  That's just a personal thing. I got to get better at
[6059.88s -> 6063.40s]  Oh bad. I think we're warmed up though. What ad carry do you guys want to see next game?
[6064.84s -> 6066.84s]  That was that was a brutal ass game
[6067.72s -> 6069.72s]  I'm gonna be real. That was a brutal ass game
[6069.72s -> 6072.92s]  What ad carry streamer do you guys want to see?
[6072.92s -> 6073.92s]  Or ad carry streamer?
[6073.92s -> 6082.50s]  What ad carry champion do you guys want to see in this game?
[6082.50s -> 6085.98s]  I just goofed up and tried to play too aggressive with a player that wasn't willing
[6085.98s -> 6086.98s]  to play aggressive.
[6086.98s -> 6087.98s]  That was on me.
[6087.98s -> 6088.98s]  That's my bad.
[6088.98s -> 6093.36s]  I'll play better.
[6093.36s -> 6119.86s]  This guy, this guy goes Sion.
[6119.86s -> 6141.21s]  Never change Twitch chat, never change.
[6141.21s -> 6145.57s]  The thing is is you have I have to change my mindset. So like the thing okay, let me explain something
[6145.57s -> 6150.21s]  It's like a personal thing with me. I'm very very very good mechanically at this game, right?
[6150.21s -> 6152.29s]  Like it's my best trade is like I have very good mechanics
[6153.09s -> 6155.93s]  So and I also have like an autistic weird brain
[6156.73s -> 6161.69s]  Where I can see I have really good pattern recognition
[6161.89s -> 6168.33s]  So when I see that the enemy is fucking up, I know that I'm pretty much always gonna be better at the 2v2
[6168.33s -> 6176.49s]  2v2 okay so because I know that I'm always gonna be better at the 2v2 I
[6176.49s -> 6181.81s]  always want to take the fight when I see that they make a mistake like they miss
[6181.81s -> 6186.49s]  a skill shot or they walk up too far or stuff like that right but the
[6186.49s -> 6189.73s]  problem is when you're bot lane you have to work with a teammate and
[6189.73s -> 6193.21s]  that's part of just playing AD carry right and if you're in solo queue you
[6193.21s -> 6201.25s]  can't always do it. So you have to, I have to like train myself to just be okay with
[6201.25s -> 6206.89s]  them making mistakes and us not abusing those mistakes. It's very frustrating for me personally
[6206.89s -> 6210.33s]  because I'm a perfectionist. So it's very frustrating for me to like see this happening.
[6210.33s -> 6213.37s]  And I'm like, Oh, I want to abuse this because I know we can, but we have to
[6213.37s -> 6217.61s]  like, I have to like tell myself not to and to just like not fuck up the way
[6217.61s -> 6221.29s]  of state, not take bad trades and shit because every time there's, there's more
[6221.29s -> 6223.89s]  To it too. So if like I walk up and I take a fight, right?
[6223.89s -> 6226.93s]  Let's say like when Rakan w'd in when the fiddle ganked for example, right?
[6228.25s -> 6234.25s]  If I take that fight, I'm now banking that fight on Lulu also playing correctly, right?
[6234.25s -> 6239.71s]  Like they they missed all their abilities and they fucked up, but I also messed like
[6241.55s -> 6246.99s]  You nobody can play perfectly every game like I can't teammates can't nobody can't it's league we're all humans, right?
[6246.99s -> 6252.87s]  So you have to bank when you're doing that on like your teammate being able to know what you want to accomplish in that moment
[6252.87s -> 6258.75s]  In solo queue with no comms, and it's really hard like it's it's a really bad mindset that I have sometimes
[6259.91s -> 6261.99s]  but it's hard to get over because like I
[6263.31s -> 6266.73s]  Like the landing phase for me is the most fun part of the game
[6266.73s -> 6274.45s]  I love landing phase because in my opinion landing phase is like a little mini chess game between the enemy botlane, right?
[6275.49s -> 6278.07s]  It's like a it's like a chess game with like mechanics
[6278.69s -> 6283.13s]  where it's like, how well can I auto space them, right?
[6283.13s -> 6284.91s]  Can I space them well?
[6284.91s -> 6287.33s]  Can I space them, by spacing I mean,
[6287.33s -> 6290.21s]  can I walk into them, trade and not take damage back,
[6290.21s -> 6291.05s]  right?
[6291.05s -> 6291.97s]  And I'm always thinking to myself,
[6291.97s -> 6292.93s]  okay, can I do that?
[6292.93s -> 6293.77s]  I can.
[6293.77s -> 6295.45s]  And then I'm like, I wanna do this, right?
[6295.45s -> 6297.05s]  And then I'll get somebody to half,
[6297.05s -> 6299.63s]  and then they'll panic and they'll engage on me.
[6299.63s -> 6301.91s]  And the problem is though, is like I said,
[6301.91s -> 6305.41s]  without comms or without people who are recognizing
[6305.41s -> 6307.21s]  what you're trying to accomplish,
[6307.21s -> 6308.57s]  sometimes
[6308.57s -> 6311.33s]  supports and in junglers people get flustered and
[6311.93s -> 6318.17s]  It will go badly and it's my fault at the end of the day because I'm choosing to that play style of relying on my teammates
[6318.65s -> 6324.17s]  Instead of like knowing that I can probably outscale and play better late game and just like keep good CS and not die
[6324.17s -> 6326.85s]  And shit, which is what you guys should all do
[6326.85s -> 6330.81s]  And that's what I tell people to do when they ask me how to play AD
[6330.81s -> 6333.57s]  I tell you like don't die scale up get items
[6333.57s -> 6338.05s]  but like because I've played the game for so long and my favorite part of the game is
[6339.93s -> 6344.93s]  Lane phase and like winning lane and playing that little chess game. I fucked myself over in a lot of games
[6345.63s -> 6351.73s]  because I'll like you know force fights that like my teammate would have to play well in as well to win and
[6352.45s -> 6356.89s]  I'll make a mistake or they'll make a mistake and we'll just lose the game off it and it's not a good
[6357.45s -> 6359.45s]  playstyle
[6359.57s -> 6361.57s]  Right it's not a good playstyle
[6361.57s -> 6367.73s]  That's just like something that like I know other people probably also have and I'm telling
[6367.73s -> 6370.83s]  you that like if you want to climb you got to get out of that mindset and get into
[6370.83s -> 6379.35s]  the mindset of like consistency because you can see last game for example I just
[6379.35s -> 6385.75s]  straight up like lost the game off of me trying to fight when my support didn't
[6385.75s -> 6389.43s]  know how to fight or want to fight and we lost the game off it.
[6389.43s -> 6396.65s]  Like, I was too aggro, and even though if they did play correctly we win, they didn't,
[6396.65s -> 6397.65s]  so we lost.
[6397.65s -> 6403.33s]  So it's basically like, it's just not like a good, uh, it's not a good, uh, what's
[6403.33s -> 6405.29s]  the word I'm looking for?
[6405.29s -> 6412.34s]  Strategy.
[6412.34s -> 6415.22s]  Because the last game was my fault.
[6415.22s -> 6419.02s]  Because I'm good enough at the game that I know that I can't play like that if
[6419.02s -> 6422.38s]  I want to be consistent, and I still play it like it, so it's my bad.
[6422.38s -> 6428.62s]  Alright, what are we playing this game, boys?
[6428.62s -> 6431.28s]  We got Rengar, Karma, Jhin.
[6432.28s -> 6433.12s]  What do people want to see?
[6433.12s -> 6434.70s]  Let me see if any of the AD carries people want to see
[6434.70s -> 6435.80s]  if I could play these.
[6437.40s -> 6439.14s]  I can't play Vayne into this.
[6439.14s -> 6440.84s]  Vayne would be way too hard in the Karma-Jhin.
[6440.84s -> 6451.10s]  I would just get zoned off the wave.
[6451.10s -> 6452.34s]  I could play Aphelios.
[6453.50s -> 6459.62s]  This is actually a good Aphelios game.
[6459.62s -> 6461.28s]  You know what kind of sucks?
[6461.28s -> 6463.86s]  I feel kind of bad playing Aphelios
[6463.86s -> 6466.44s]  when I'm on my like teaching accounts,
[6466.44s -> 6468.46s]  like this account to like teach you guys.
[6468.46s -> 6470.58s]  I feel bad playing Aphelios sometimes,
[6472.10s -> 6475.54s]  because I know a lot of people don't want to learn Aphelios
[6475.54s -> 6478.96s]  or play Aphelios, because he is like really,
[6480.58s -> 6482.02s]  he's very unique.
[6483.34s -> 6486.50s]  Like he's hard to learn for a lot of people.
[6486.50s -> 6490.24s]  So I always feel kind of bad doing it, right?
[6491.42s -> 6493.26s]  But I'll be real, I don't know,
[6493.26s -> 6496.06s]  in this specific situation outside of like Jinx,
[6496.06s -> 6500.42s]  I didn't really know what else to pick.
[6500.42s -> 6512.28s]  Like Jinx is good, Kai'Sa's probably okay, but you still get zoned off the wave on Kai'Sa.
[6512.28s -> 6520.95s]  Because like if we look at this, right, Kai'Sa would have been, I guess, okay.
[6520.95s -> 6525.09s]  But when you're picking a champion for bot lane, right, when you're picking a champion
[6525.09s -> 6529.75s]  for bot lane, one thing that you guys should think about when picking like what champion
[6529.75s -> 6532.47s]  you want to play, unless you're a one trick and then play whatever you want, but
[6532.47s -> 6536.43s]  If you're like somebody who wants to actually like play the meta and learn why champions
[6536.43s -> 6542.68s]  are meta and when to pick what, they picked Jhin Karma.
[6542.68s -> 6545.28s]  Now we have a Lulu.
[6545.28s -> 6550.52s]  If we had something with a hook, like a Nautilus, a Blitz, a Thresh, a Pyke,
[6550.52s -> 6554.80s]  like if we had something like that, I could pick a low range fighter, right?
[6554.80s -> 6558.32s]  Like I could pick a low range fighter if we had a hook champ.
[6558.32s -> 6562.12s]  But because we don't have a hook champ and we have an enchanter, I have to pick
[6562.12s -> 6567.88s]  something that can safely consistently farm and not get zoned off by their bot lane.
[6567.88s -> 6570.76s]  So there's not a lot of options that can do that.
[6570.76s -> 6574.60s]  There's like, I didn't want to pick, you could pick Ezreal here, it's not the worst,
[6574.60s -> 6578.20s]  but we had a Lulu so I didn't want to pick Ezreal because Lulu goes to waste.
[6578.20s -> 6580.80s]  So it's like you could pick Jinx, but I kind of didn't want to pick Jinx this
[6580.80s -> 6583.50s]  game because Jinx bores the shit out of me right now.
[6583.50s -> 6587.60s]  So this would be a good Jinx game though, if you guys are curious, like this would
[6587.60s -> 6589.48s]  be a completely fine Jinx game.
[6589.48s -> 6596.24s]  E stops Rengar jump, you can follow up really easily with Lulu, like this would be a good
[6596.24s -> 6603.32s]  Jinx game. But Aphelios, it's a good Aphelios game too, it's both. It's got Aphelios game,
[6603.32s -> 6609.96s]  good Jinx game. It could be a good Zery game. Zery wouldn't be that bad here with Lulu
[6609.96s -> 6614.08s]  and against their comp, they're all really squishy. She's really mobile, can get away
[6614.08s -> 6618.98s]  from like Rengar ganks pretty easily Tristana I okay so Trist is unique
[6618.98s -> 6625.36s]  because you only pick Tristana if you plan on winning lane okay
[6625.36s -> 6632.32s]  Tristana doesn't actually scale better than Jinx in any way like she
[6632.32s -> 6636.68s]  does not have a better scaling than Jinx Trist Trist vs Jinx three items
[6636.68s -> 6642.02s]  Jinx wins every time in teamfights no matter what like you she just does
[6642.02s -> 6647.74s]  what Trist does better. Now, the reason you pick Trist is because you do want to win lane,
[6647.74s -> 6650.98s]  you want to like jump in, you want to kill them, you want to be aggressive, right? So
[6650.98s -> 6655.16s]  that's what you're picking Trist for, is to get kills in lane. The problem is, is
[6655.16s -> 6658.22s]  again what we were just talking about, right? Let's say I pick Trist to get kills
[6658.22s -> 6663.62s]  in lane. Now let's say my, my support doesn't want to be aggressive. And let's
[6663.62s -> 6667.98s]  say like the Janna and the Karma have a really good push. Okay? Something that
[6667.98s -> 6671.60s]  that Trist is really weak at is being pushed in, right?
[6671.60s -> 6673.20s]  That's one of her weakest things because she has,
[6673.20s -> 6675.26s]  she struggles, especially early game.
[6675.26s -> 6678.20s]  She struggles quite a bit on farming under turret.
[6678.20s -> 6682.72s]  So let's say it's just like a coin flippy pick.
[6682.72s -> 6686.40s]  You could pick Trist if you had like a support duo,
[6686.40s -> 6688.40s]  for sure, into Jhin.
[6688.40s -> 6689.84s]  Trist is amazing into Jhin.
[6689.84s -> 6692.16s]  It's one of Jhin's hardest actual counters.
[6692.16s -> 6694.68s]  But again, it's not about countering the champion,
[6694.68s -> 6695.60s]  it's about countering the lane
[6695.60s -> 6697.38s]  and what the lane is going to do to you
[6697.38s -> 6699.68s]  and being able to play around that.
[6699.68s -> 6701.56s]  And this lane is a shove lane.
[6701.56s -> 6703.12s]  Jhin, Karma doesn't fight you.
[6703.12s -> 6705.00s]  They poke you and shove waves in.
[6705.00s -> 6706.90s]  That's what they do, they're a prio lane.
[6706.90s -> 6709.16s]  So they're just gonna shove and shove and shove, right?
[6709.16s -> 6711.44s]  So because they're just gonna shove and shove and shove,
[6711.44s -> 6713.76s]  I need to play something that isn't gonna have issues
[6713.76s -> 6714.60s]  playing under turret
[6714.60s -> 6717.40s]  or something that can shove back if I need to.
[6717.40s -> 6724.14s]  Right, which is why Jinx, Aphelios are both good.
[6724.14s -> 6725.94s]  Ezreal, again, would just get shoved in.
[6725.94s -> 6726.86s]  Stuff like that, right?
[6726.86s -> 6728.22s]  These are things you actually have to think about
[6728.22s -> 6729.64s]  when you're playing the game
[6729.64s -> 6733.96s]  for certain champions in certain matchups.
[6733.96s -> 6735.64s]  Because a lot of the time,
[6735.64s -> 6737.36s]  people will pick a champion that's meta
[6737.36s -> 6738.60s]  and they won't understand
[6738.60s -> 6740.18s]  why they're still losing the matchup,
[6740.18s -> 6742.34s]  even though they're good at that champion.
[6742.34s -> 6744.48s]  And it's just that you're not bad at the champ,
[6744.48s -> 6746.32s]  the matchup is just unplayable.
[6746.32s -> 6749.44s]  You could put Faker, Doublelift,
[6749.44s -> 6751.36s]  fucking Gumiasi in certain matchups
[6751.36s -> 6752.36s]  and they will just lose.
[6752.36s -> 6753.68s]  They will lose the matchups.
[6753.68s -> 6756.92s]  And it's because no matter how good your mechanics are,
[6756.92s -> 6758.16s]  if the matchup is played correctly,
[6758.16s -> 6763.86s]  It doesn't it's not winnable and that's why you see in pro play drafting is so important
[6763.86s -> 6767.48s]  It's perfect example of why in pro play drafting is ten times more important than solo queue
[6767.48s -> 6770.78s]  And it's because when everybody plays the matchups correctly and shit, right?
[6771.30s -> 6774.71s]  When everybody's playing the matchups correctly and shits
[6775.81s -> 6779.27s]  The matchup like skill becomes a thousand times more important
[6780.35s -> 6786.79s]  Or like, you know how the matchups being played like the champions become way more important. Whoa, what the fuck?
[6787.87s -> 6790.15s]  My monitor just fucked up. What the hell is going on?
[6794.59s -> 6798.71s]  Another little tip for you guys. Oh, I fucked that but another little tip for you guys is
[6801.53s -> 6804.55s]  melee champions or melee minions take
[6810.82s -> 6812.82s]  one turret shot two autos
[6812.82s -> 6817.79s]  Or sorry two turret shots one auto and casters take one auto one turret shot
[6819.41s -> 6821.91s]  When you're under turrets like look, okay, so
[6823.19s -> 6826.75s]  Learning this would be actually a pretty game to explain to you how to farm under the turret actually
[6826.75s -> 6830.87s]  I was thinking about like what I could teach you guys because we're just gonna get shoved in a lot this game
[6830.87s -> 6842.62s]  It's actually not that bad though, uh, so right now we could actually space forward here
[6842.62s -> 6858.83s]  Okay, that did not hit me that was bs, but sure I did the same thing I did last game
[6858.83s -> 6864.39s]  man I did the same thing you see I walked up
[6864.39s -> 6869.31s]  It wasn't it was a good fight. But again, I keep doing that where like I see the
[6869.31s -> 6873.55s]  fight and I'll take the fight because I know it's a good fight
[6873.55s -> 6878.42s]  Lulu was too far back, so I ended up just inting.
[6878.42s -> 6881.81s]  It's really stupid.
[6881.81s -> 6897.90s]  Like, that was such a dumb play by me.
[6897.90s -> 6899.22s]  Because I had to blow both my sums right there,
[6899.22s -> 6902.34s]  because the Jhin, or I mean,
[6902.34s -> 6903.66s]  the Jhin was in a really bad spot,
[6903.66s -> 6904.86s]  and the Karma was in a really bad spot,
[6904.86s -> 6906.44s]  because I was level three, and they were level two,
[6906.44s -> 6909.00s]  and they were walking up to contest waves.
[6909.00s -> 6911.74s]  But, my Lulu was behind me,
[6911.74s -> 6914.42s]  and when you're playing, you know, solo queue,
[6914.42s -> 6916.82s]  you have to play as a team, with your teammate.
[6917.70s -> 6926.02s]  Okay, so this Jhin is kind of griefing right now.
[6926.02s -> 6929.18s]  He's griefing by like walking up when I'm blue gunning him.
[6934.82s -> 6935.98s]  I don't know what Lulu's doing.
[6935.98s -> 6938.74s]  Oh, she's killing that guy. Nice. Yeah, they're they're griefing really hard.
[6938.74s -> 6940.82s]  So the blue gun is OP for what you just saw.
[6941.62s -> 6942.86s]  All you have to do with the blue gun,
[6942.86s -> 6945.86s]  if you really want to just like have a funny ass overpowered fucking.
[6947.30s -> 6949.94s]  When they're farming under the turret like that,
[6949.94s -> 6958.15s]  just hit the minions.
[6958.15s -> 6959.87s]  OK, we're getting ganked.
[6960.59s -> 6961.55s]  Let's back up.
[6966.78s -> 6970.66s]  So I kind of did a cardinal sin there, I would say, like a sin of like
[6970.66s -> 6973.62s]  I overstayed a bit. I think oh
[6975.54s -> 6977.54s]  Okay, well fuck off dude
[6978.58s -> 6982.32s]  That was greedy I should have backed out the turret, but I didn't think Karma was actually gonna do that
[6982.32s -> 6987.90s]  But I did overstay because you can see like this is the perfect example of why I overstayed so they stopped my back, right? I
[6988.88s -> 6991.48s]  Can give you guys a really good example of what just happens. I
[6992.62s -> 6993.94s]  overstayed and
[6993.94s -> 6998.20s]  When I overstayed I didn't actually get anything out of it like I got what you saw
[6998.20s -> 7002.84s]  just have extra gold for nothing. So now I just have extra gold, right? And because I have extra
[7002.84s -> 7007.56s]  gold, the gen actually gets a net positive because they stopped my back. So he gets a free plate
[7007.56s -> 7012.92s]  here, I miss a cannon. And even though I'm still up 10 CS, it's like I could have been up 10 CS,
[7013.56s -> 7018.28s]  not given a plate and not missed a cannon. So it's it's basically like,
[7019.96s -> 7026.64s]  it's interesting. Should you get prio for your jungle every game? No, no, that's not important.
[7026.64s -> 7034.62s]  some games prio is important it's very important some games but you don't need
[7034.62s -> 7038.58s]  to always be thinking about getting prio for your jungler that's not something you
[7038.58s -> 7041.30s]  should be like thinking about like always right like you think about it in
[7041.30s -> 7045.66s]  terms of like timers that's important but prio for jungler always is not
[7045.66s -> 7055.88s]  like something you should be worrying about because if you're perma shoving
[7055.88s -> 7058.44s]  and you're like oh I have prio for my jungler but then your jungler
[7058.44s -> 7062.36s]  doesn't do anything like having that prio if you don't have prio it
[7062.36s -> 7070.17s]  doesn't do anything like I'd rather hold the wave in like a certain spot oh my
[7070.17s -> 7106.52s]  god I suck I mean it worked out I think if I was six I triple kill them there
[7106.52s -> 7112.88s]  but I think we actually almost I think we actually triple kill them too
[7112.88s -> 7116.44s]  if Lulu helps me but again you guys know what I'm gonna say I go back to
[7116.44s -> 7167.27s]  the thing I don't know if Rengar has ulti or not I want to shove this
[7167.27s -> 7185.83s]  because uh chill i want to shove it in for a second and i really don't have anything to do
[7185.83s -> 7191.67s]  so i'll just stand here you want to also be back backed uh what's the tip for when you buy boots
[7191.67s -> 7195.75s]  i bought boots aphelios you can buy boots really early he's like he's a champion where
[7196.31s -> 7200.39s]  the more attacks you do is actually very valuable and positioning on aphelios is very
[7200.39s -> 7206.07s]  important it's kind of like um some ad carries like you don't need boots really early like
[7206.07s -> 7213.59s]  Like with like Jinx, for example, I usually go free boots, right? Or I go boots like after my Kraken, but with Aphelios
[7214.47s -> 7217.73s]  I really like the early mobility, the early trading
[7218.43s -> 7224.45s]  stuff like that
[7224.45s -> 7227.95s]  Okay, so always be watching the map too. We see the Rengar's top, right?
[7228.45s -> 7230.99s]  We can actually just straight fight these guys 2v2 right now
[7232.99s -> 7242.67s]  What? Wait, what? What's my Lulu doing? Homie?
[7243.43s -> 7245.75s]  What what are we he's ulting us
[7256.77s -> 7258.77s]  So you're saying
[7258.89s -> 7271.78s]  Helping the ad carry is bad. Got it. I can't believe my Lulu just walked away from me and
[7272.54s -> 7275.70s]  Just like watched like you work as a team
[7277.02s -> 7279.26s]  This is something that I cannot stress enough
[7282.11s -> 7284.11s]  play as a team
[7284.65s -> 7286.65s]  when you play League of Legends
[7286.65s -> 7294.43s]  This tilts me more than anything because this happens even in Grandmaster. I see teammates who will be selfish and not help each other
[7295.29s -> 7297.29s]  Just help each other
[7297.85s -> 7300.89s]  Help each other, please man. We are a team
[7303.61s -> 7306.67s]  Don't just run and leave your ADC
[7307.49s -> 7312.23s]  Like I'm not even flaming you but like dude, you can't do that
[7313.31s -> 7317.55s]  You can't be upset that like like I can't dodge every spell
[7317.55s -> 7325.27s]  Welcome to the league. I feel like something that I noticed that happens a lot in League notice is players will have this weirdly high
[7325.87s -> 7329.63s]  expectation for everyone to play absolutely perfect at all times and
[7330.71s -> 7337.05s]  And they want me to like be Gumiassi and I'm like dude, I dodged two of the gin bullets
[7337.05s -> 7339.05s]  I dodged a Karma Q
[7339.51s -> 7344.23s]  Like you literally like I can't dodge literally everything while slowed right? Like that's not how it works
[7352.64s -> 7355.40s]  Like dude, I'm gonna lose my mind with this guy
[7356.36s -> 7386.93s]  My Lulu is
[7387.21s -> 7397.46s]  Blaming me. It's okay. It's okay. I don't need to be upset
[7398.34s -> 7400.02s]  It's fine
[7400.02s -> 7402.02s]  the Lulu player is
[7403.10s -> 7411.14s]  Totally, okay, you know, sometimes people think they're right
[7411.96s -> 7413.60s]  It's just
[7413.60s -> 7416.24s]  What happens in the world?
[7423.83s -> 7428.19s]  Right, it's just it is what it is. No big deal
[7441.92s -> 7447.42s]  Sorry, I'm trying really hard to not be an asshole right now. This Lulu player is making me like
[7448.24s -> 7452.16s]  Making me want to like fund Thanos, you know what I mean? Like this guy is like making me
[7453.28s -> 7458.82s]  Like this guy like we talk about we like in league we talk about like the players
[7459.76s -> 7462.36s]  Like we talk about ad carry players having ego. I
[7463.56s -> 7465.56s]  genuinely think
[7465.56s -> 7471.38s]  Support players have five times the ego ad carry players have but with like a third of the skill
[7471.38s -> 7477.78s]  I think ad carry players do have massive egos
[7480.14s -> 7485.50s]  but again, I don't think that like I think support players are genuinely the dumbest
[7486.06s -> 7492.82s]  motherfucking humans on the planet and they think that they're the best players to ever touch the game and it hurts my fucking balls
[7514.86s -> 7516.86s]  Hey, Lulu
[7516.94s -> 7519.94s]  Would you be willing to have a
[7519.94s -> 7524.94s]  a VOD review with me in Discord after the game.
[7527.20s -> 7528.04s]  Let's just see.
[7528.04s -> 7529.30s]  I wanna see if like this person is willing
[7529.30s -> 7530.30s]  to listen to reason.
[7532.30s -> 7557.21s]  Let's see.
[7557.21s -> 7559.85s]  I'm trying to not tilt, but it's really frustrating.
[7561.25s -> 7564.17s]  Cause this player is playing specifically for KDA.
[7565.57s -> 7567.97s]  And they're playing like they don't understand how,
[7567.97s -> 7569.57s]  like I can already tell you,
[7569.57s -> 7571.85s]  if I go look at this person's OP.GG,
[7571.85s -> 7573.21s]  they only play for KDA.
[7573.21s -> 7575.61s]  I can tell you right now, right here,
[7575.61s -> 7580.05s]  this person plays only for KDA, never takes any risks,
[7580.05s -> 7583.05s]  doesn't ever help their AD carry ever when they get behind,
[7583.05s -> 7585.65s]  doesn't ever walk up to like try and fight,
[7585.65s -> 7586.73s]  doesn't do any of that.
[7586.73s -> 7587.69s]  I can tell you right now,
[7587.69s -> 7589.23s]  without even looking at their OP.GG,
[7589.23s -> 7590.93s]  from how this person plays,
[7590.93s -> 7598.60s]  that they have high KDAs, but really low win rate.
[7598.60s -> 7599.68s]  But I don't want my entire stream
[7599.68s -> 7600.82s]  to be bitching about this Lulu,
[7600.82s -> 7602.02s]  so we'll try and focus on how to win
[7602.02s -> 7603.86s]  from this position,
[7603.86s -> 7605.84s]  because I'm sure you guys get shitty supports too.
[7605.84s -> 7606.94s]  So we'll try and focus on how to win
[7606.94s -> 7620.33s]  from the current position we're in.
[7620.33s -> 7621.27s]  Yeah, it doesn't get better.
[7621.27s -> 7622.93s]  I mean, I'll be honest with you.
[7622.93s -> 7625.49s]  My Grandmaster supports on my main suck.
[7625.49s -> 7627.63s]  Like, it doesn't get better.
[7627.63s -> 7630.47s]  They get better like mechanically at the game, right?
[7630.47s -> 7633.99s]  Like the higher ELO supports get better mechanically,
[7633.99s -> 7637.55s]  but they don't get better when like,
[7637.55s -> 7638.51s]  it doesn't get better.
[7638.51s -> 7639.83s]  It's always like, you'll either have
[7639.83s -> 7641.11s]  a really good support or you'll have somebody
[7641.11s -> 7649.83s]  who sniffs glue.
[7649.83s -> 7653.59s]  I'm just dead.
[7653.59s -> 7673.70s]  Or I'm not dead.
[7673.70s -> 7676.04s]  Okay.
[7676.04s -> 7680.96s]  Uh, honestly, our biggest issue here is I need to get Bloodthirster ASAP.
[7680.96s -> 7692.70s]  Once I get BT, the game gets a lot easier.
[7692.70s -> 7695.04s]  We could kill this guy right now.
[7695.04s -> 7698.58s]  If the Lulu helps me, we can actually just straight kill these guys.
[7698.58s -> 7700.42s]  Because I can ulti to heal myself, right?
[7700.42s -> 7704.90s]  We have Lulu ult, I have ult to heal myself, and I'm strong.
[7704.90s -> 7707.18s]  She has ignite, I have ult, I have everything.
[7707.18s -> 7713.70s]  We could easily kill that Taliyah right there.
[7713.70s -> 7715.06s]  I mean yeah, whatever man.
[7715.94s -> 7721.52s]  This is what I'm talking about.
[7721.52s -> 7726.52s]  Again, are you willing to get into Discord and VOD review?
[7727.84s -> 7737.00s]  Yes or no?
[7737.00s -> 7741.20s]  I mean, I have to be honest with you.
[7741.20s -> 7742.92s]  The reason this is frustrating is because
[7742.92s -> 7744.48s]  as an AD carry player,
[7744.48s -> 7747.84s]  you want to be able to rely on your support, right?
[7747.84s -> 7750.44s]  You want to be able to make plays, go in, fight,
[7750.44s -> 7751.48s]  and rely on your teammates.
[7751.48s -> 7753.24s]  Because as an AD carry player,
[7753.24s -> 7754.72s]  support and AD are like a duo, right?
[7754.72s -> 7756.32s]  Like you want to play together.
[7756.66s -> 7764.88s]  no no man I'm not attacking you I'm saying let's discord after you can
[7764.88s -> 7777.86s]  explain your POV and I'll explain mine maybe we can like improve this player
[7777.86s -> 7782.06s]  like get them to be a better player and not ruin every game they play in
[7782.06s -> 7792.60s]  like that would be that would be the goat like the app that did not hit me
[7792.60s -> 7805.98s]  by the way, that HippoX is BS, but I don't even understand.
[7810.12s -> 7817.00s]  Oh man.
[7817.00s -> 7822.69s]  This is the person's, by the way,
[7822.69s -> 7824.13s]  this is the person's OP.GG.
[7825.05s -> 7828.41s]  Average win rate, 50% win rate, like I said,
[7828.41s -> 7830.75s]  has really good KDAs on all his champs,
[7832.05s -> 7835.05s]  but he doesn't win.
[7835.05s -> 7837.05s]  I'm telling you right now,
[7837.05s -> 7839.05s]  the biggest thing in League,
[7839.05s -> 7841.93s]  the fakest thing in League of Legends
[7841.93s -> 7846.53s]  is believing that you are a good player based on KDA.
[7846.53s -> 7851.43s]  If I go look at any challenger level support player right now, their KDAs will be like
[7851.43s -> 7852.43s]  4.
[7852.43s -> 7859.81s]  They'll still have good KDA, but it'll be like 4 and 3, and it'll be on, that's
[7859.81s -> 7860.81s]  your mutual.
[7860.81s -> 7867.27s]  I'm gonna be real with you right now, T. This Lulu player, like, you could tell
[7867.27s -> 7872.23s]  me that this person sniffed glue as a kid and their parents never told them to stop,
[7872.23s -> 7876.95s]  and I would believe you. I'm not even memeing, like I would say that makes sense. I mean,
[7876.95s -> 7881.55s]  like I said, I don't even care. I don't care if it's a girl or a guy. The e-girl
[7881.55s -> 7884.27s]  thing is like, that doesn't bother me, right? Like, it could be a girl, a guy,
[7884.27s -> 7891.03s]  a pigeon. They could fucking, they could relate as a fucking peanut in a fucking
[7891.03s -> 7897.29s]  plane. I don't care about that at all. You know what I mean? Like, that shit
[7897.29s -> 7901.93s]  it doesn't bother me at all. Like, them be- like, I- I actually think it's stupid when
[7901.93s -> 7906.57s]  people are like, oh it's an E-girl, E-guy. Like, I- I think that's dumb as shit because
[7906.57s -> 7910.69s]  that argument's so crap. Cause like, I don't give a shit if it's a guy or girl
[7910.69s -> 7913.49s]  because like, you know what I mean? I'm more upset at the fact that this person
[7913.49s -> 7929.44s]  is delusional than anything. That's like what's tilting me. Here, I'm just gonna
[7929.44s -> 7934.24s]  mute. We'll do one more game on this account after this game, and I'm gonna mute
[7934.24s -> 7942.66s]  from the start of the game for you guys, okay?
[7942.66s -> 7945.30s]  Dude, if he didn't actually get me into the wall there,
[7945.30s -> 7946.84s]  I tried to walk forward,
[7946.84s -> 7948.46s]  so that I wouldn't get condemned in the wall.
[7948.46s -> 7950.38s]  If he didn't stun me, I kill him.
[7950.38s -> 7951.46s]  Ah, that's annoying.
[7953.02s -> 7955.78s]  That was actually such a good hitbox for him.
[7955.78s -> 7970.67s]  My bad.
[7970.67s -> 7971.51s]  Nice.
[7971.51s -> 7973.07s]  Huge shutdown, nice job.
[7973.07s -> 7974.59s]  If you're wondering why I'm even here, by the way,
[7974.59s -> 7976.31s]  I'm actually, I'm not trolling.
[7976.31s -> 7977.35s]  I'm trying to get this turret
[7977.35s -> 7979.39s]  because this gives me a lot of gold.
[7979.39s -> 7982.03s]  At the moment, I'm not actually worth that much gold.
[7982.03s -> 7983.23s]  There's nothing going on in the map.
[7983.23s -> 7987.79s]  There's no objective or anything like that. Right? So I'm trying to push in top waves right now so that I can get gold
[7989.27s -> 7992.47s]  To try and like hyper inflate my two item before this next dragon
[7993.03s -> 7997.21s]  Because this next dragon is gonna be incredibly important if we if we want any chance to win
[7998.07s -> 8000.07s]  we have to win that this next dragon and
[8000.51s -> 8003.93s]  the only way for me to do that is to either get really lucky or
[8005.23s -> 8007.23s]  Go get some gold in a side win
[8007.59s -> 8012.03s]  It's just support difference every game it is I want to point this out
[8012.03s -> 8018.33s]  This person is playing this victim complex bullshit. Like you know what I mean, but it is it is actually support death
[8055.09s -> 8057.21s]  Sorry, I'm tilted. I'm playing bad this game. I
[8058.69s -> 8061.69s]  Need to mute these players because these players are actually tilting me
[8063.09s -> 8066.83s]  Like I was fine with it before but I'm actually getting a little irritated. That's making me play bad
[8067.65s -> 8069.95s]  So I need to mute them so I don't keep inting
[8070.73s -> 8074.73s]  Like it's affecting my gameplay and it's pissing me off
[8076.95s -> 8078.45s]  That's just my bad
[8078.45s -> 8087.71s]  T split. Are you here T?
[8088.11s -> 8095.45s]  Yo, T, message this Lulu. I mean this in the nicest way. I don't even want to be toxic.
[8095.45s -> 8102.61s]  I genuinely want to use this for content. Like this guy's been flaming me the whole
[8102.61s -> 8107.75s]  game. Like I want to use this for content to show you guys that it is so easy to
[8107.75s -> 8113.73s]  tell people how the game should be played. So easy if you can communicate by talking.
[8113.73s -> 8120.47s]  Because this guy's been doing nothing but flaming me the entire game. This Lulu,
[8120.47s -> 8127.45s]  But he's an absolute like he played the lane completely bad. Then he then he stopped trying to win
[8128.21s -> 8131.31s]  Stop shielding me stop doing anything right after he played the lane back
[8132.17s -> 8137.79s]  Then he started playing the victim thing when I asked him to be a human and like come over and like help me
[8137.79s -> 8140.51s]  And play teamwork you gotta remember I didn't blame him a single time
[8140.95s -> 8144.63s]  Right, like I didn't say a single negative thing to this guy in game. I said, let's work as a team
[8145.23s -> 8150.45s]  He got upset
[8150.45s -> 8154.09s]  like I genuinely think it'd be great content if I could talk to this guy in discord and
[8154.09s -> 8156.79s]  And just like oh, I'd be so good
[8173.58s -> 8176.86s]  Right, dude. I'm I'm trying to kill these people guys
[8177.66s -> 8184.30s]  That wasn't bad though. We got 800 golden not the worst, but I don't know if my team can stall this
[8185.08s -> 8187.30s]  maybe if they can like kill this they can stall it but
[8191.50s -> 8195.88s]  Now they're yeah, that's that's GG. That was a disgusting tallie aw
[8196.70s -> 8238.02s]  All right, I'm gonna add him and he'll probably not add me but I might as well try
[8238.52s -> 8243.05s]  This would be such a good learning experience. Oh
[8243.05s -> 8256.57s]  Oh, excuse me, dude. I've had like bad heartburn today. I need to take one of those heartburn pills
[8262.25s -> 8265.43s]  What Lulu what man? Just say I just let it out
[8266.09s -> 8269.55s]  Let it out
[8269.55s -> 8271.09s]  Let it out, baby
[8271.09s -> 8272.71s]  Yo
[8272.71s -> 8280.39s]  Lulu let's just just have a talk. Yo
[8281.11s -> 8283.11s]  Let's discord
[8283.27s -> 8285.27s]  We can bother of you
[8285.79s -> 8287.79s]  Since I'm so bad
[8288.23s -> 8297.33s]  Yeah
[8297.33s -> 8298.37s]  trust
[8298.37s -> 8304.37s]  You you just
[8305.13s -> 8306.93s]  Blamed everyone
[8306.93s -> 8308.57s]  But yourself
[8308.57s -> 8317.74s]  But you didn't play correctly at all. You'd played lane completely wrong
[8319.50s -> 8325.12s]  Didn't help each other left people to die on repeats
[8326.72s -> 8338.99s]  Then played victim I
[8339.47s -> 8366.58s]  Genuinely want to help you this guy
[8366.58s -> 8374.00s]  I screenshotted what I just said and put it in the end game chat.
[8374.00s -> 8385.32s]  What is happening right now?
[8385.32s -> 8388.50s]  What is going on?
[8388.50s -> 8400.18s]  There is no way that this is not an NPC.
[8400.18s -> 8404.78s]  There is no way this is not an NPC.
[8404.78s -> 8407.84s]  There's no way.
[8407.84s -> 8422.54s]  no way it's Geronimo the mouth it is me yes bro just come talk in discord I'm
[8422.54s -> 8436.25s]  not even gonna flame you what does this even mean bro I don't think I've seen
[8436.25s -> 8446.64s]  anybody more insecure in my life bro you are so insecure it's cringe how
[8446.64s -> 8460.87s]  insecure you are like oof good luck man on the climb to masters but Jesus Christ
[8460.87s -> 8472.22s]  that's sad oh god I dude I don't even know what to say like I'm gonna be real
[8472.22s -> 8476.82s]  I was like I'm not even gonna flame the guy right I just genuinely want
[8476.82s -> 8483.30s]  to like improve the community because that was three straight supports in a
[8483.30s -> 8489.14s]  They didn't know how to play Lulu and I'm not even gonna flame the guy's skill. He's not a Lulu player, right?
[8489.14s -> 8495.22s]  He doesn't play Lulu. That's fine. But the issue was that I had with that guy specifically was that
[8495.66s -> 8497.66s]  It's okay to be bad at the game
[8497.94s -> 8500.66s]  Right. There's nothing wrong with being bad at League
[8500.66s -> 8505.92s]  Everybody has bad games, but when we're playing a game together and you're saying it's winnable and you want to win the game
[8506.10s -> 8508.10s]  You can't pick and choose
[8508.70s -> 8510.70s]  Who to like help win the game?
[8510.70s -> 8516.94s]  Like, if I'm sitting there bot lane, we're both being dove by Jhin, and you're intentionally
[8516.94s -> 8523.00s]  trying not to take damage and not die because you want to value your KDA over everything
[8523.00s -> 8524.26s]  else.
[8524.26s -> 8528.60s]  So that, I, you know what, hold on, let me think about this.
[8528.60s -> 8531.94s]  I think I figured this person out.
[8531.94s -> 8535.64s]  This person lives in delusion, and I think I figured this out, let me explain this.
[8535.64s -> 8539.06s]  A lot of players do this, but I think I'm figuring this out as I'm thinking about
[8539.06s -> 8540.34s]  this.
[8540.34s -> 8544.90s]  So this person has really good KDAs on their profile, right?
[8544.90s -> 8546.58s]  This like, this eye-catching person.
[8546.58s -> 8549.60s]  They have really really good KDAs on their profile, right?
[8549.60s -> 8555.52s]  This person doesn't ever take risks, doesn't ever do anything to try and win the game
[8555.52s -> 8561.12s]  outside of like, just existing and hitting buttons.
[8561.12s -> 8565.68s]  And what they do is they will always have good KDAs, and they will, they will sit
[8565.68s -> 8568.64s]  here and never, like I know why they're losing.
[8568.64s -> 8571.72s]  They will sit here and they will do this shit where they have good KDAs, they, they,
[8571.72s -> 8574.00s]  They don't ever die that much, blah, blah, blah.
[8574.00s -> 8576.84s]  But what they do is they lie to themselves
[8576.84s -> 8579.52s]  and they say, look how good my KDAs are.
[8579.52s -> 8585.02s]  If I had better teammates, I'd always win.
[8585.02s -> 8589.04s]  Like, I cracked the code, actually.
[8589.04s -> 8590.84s]  That's totally what it is.
[8590.84s -> 8594.00s]  The players actually like play so safe
[8594.00s -> 8596.92s]  and they play to like for statistics, right?
[8596.92s -> 8599.50s]  They play like purely for the stats.
[8599.50s -> 8602.40s]  And then they can say that it was their team's fault
[8602.40s -> 8606.60s]  that they didn't win because they played really bad,
[8606.60s -> 8612.54s]  but they didn't die.
[8612.54s -> 8613.90s]  Because I mean, in theory,
[8613.90s -> 8617.68s]  I could have a perfect KDA on every AD carry I play.
[8617.68s -> 8618.52s]  Right?
[8618.52s -> 8620.50s]  All I'd have to do is literally walk up,
[8620.50s -> 8622.34s]  get one kill and then AFK
[8622.34s -> 8625.72s]  and stay in the base the rest of the game.
[8625.72s -> 8626.56s]  And I could be like, yo,
[8626.56s -> 8627.62s]  why is my team not able to carry?
[8627.62s -> 8631.47s]  What's happening?
[8631.47s -> 8632.41s]  Right?
[8632.41s -> 8633.97s]  Like you can literally do that.
[8633.97s -> 8635.41s]  No, I seriously think the person's
[8635.41s -> 8636.73s]  self-gaslighting himself.
[8638.09s -> 8638.93s]  Like I'm serious.
[8638.93s -> 8640.93s]  I think this person's like self-gaslighting
[8640.93s -> 8641.85s]  where they're like,
[8641.85s -> 8644.07s]  oh, it's my team's fault every game, right?
[8644.07s -> 8646.81s]  Like they're always blaming their team for their loses
[8646.81s -> 8648.29s]  and their mistakes and shits.
[8648.29s -> 8650.29s]  And it's sad because like,
[8650.29s -> 8651.75s]  there's a reason you're D2.
[8651.75s -> 8653.17s]  And I'm not saying that to be toxic.
[8653.17s -> 8655.93s]  I'm saying that like you haven't improved in four years
[8655.93s -> 8657.45s]  and you haven't improved because all you're doing
[8657.45s -> 8659.75s]  is playing to blame your team every single game
[8659.75s -> 8662.47s]  when I just saw like 500 mistakes that you made
[8662.47s -> 8671.64s]  that we could have won the game off of early game.
[8671.64s -> 8673.16s]  Here, I remember somebody wanted me to play
[8673.16s -> 8674.98s]  a Caitlyn game last game.
[8674.98s -> 8676.48s]  So, uh, we're gonna play Cait.
[8677.78s -> 8680.98s]  I don't remember- I don't remember who it was in the chat, somebody- like, two people said Cait.
[8681.68s -> 8683.28s]  But, uh, we'll do a Cait game for you guys.
[8684.18s -> 8685.28s]  Uh, I got you boys, don't worry.
[8703.23s -> 8704.33s]  Alright, I'm gonna take...
[8704.93s -> 8708.03s]  Ghost Flash, because they have three melee champs- four melee champs.
[8708.03s -> 8711.63s]  They have- they have Rakan, Zed, Kled, Gragas, so I'm gonna take, uh, Ghost Flash.
[8713.33s -> 8714.73s]  These are gonna be my runes this game.
[8715.23s -> 8718.33s]  I'm gonna take a little more MR, because I don't think we're gonna be fighting too much in lane.
[8718.73s -> 8720.23s]  We're pretty much just gonna be poking them...
[8720.83s -> 8721.63s]  ...with Karma-Cait.
[8722.23s -> 8726.03s]  So I'm gonna take a little bit of extra MMR because I'm gonna be playing for mid-delay game. I'm just scaling
[8727.51s -> 8737.03s]  And these are gonna be the runes that I take
[8737.11s -> 8739.61s]  Even class on ADC or the easier to play ones
[8740.19s -> 8745.15s]  In ADC, I usually do like when I'm playing on this account right now. This is like my teaching account
[8745.91s -> 8749.99s]  It's a little lower MMR right? It's like D1 low masters. I usually
[8750.67s -> 8756.45s]  Play ADC's that like the chat wants to see me play so that you guys can learn like good and bad matchups
[8756.45s -> 8758.45s]  And things like that
[8758.45s -> 8764.77s]  The last two games I got way too tilted by shitty support players like egos and all that shit
[8764.77s -> 8768.17s]  I got way too frustrated and I played bad the last two games. So we're gonna
[8769.13s -> 8771.71s]  Honestly, I'm just gonna I think I'm just gonna mute these people at the very start of the game
[8772.49s -> 8777.31s]  Normally, I wouldn't suggest you mute people because like playing as a team is really important
[8778.53s -> 8782.09s]  Because like, you know, you need to communicate and all that shit, but I am just like I'm gonna mute them
[8782.09s -> 8784.09s]  Because I
[8785.73s -> 8789.81s]  Dude my mental is taking a fucking hit right now, so we're gonna just chill and play I
[8793.55s -> 8798.51s]  Just don't know how to play Nila. I think that was really good. I just don't I don't know how to play her. I
[8799.95s -> 8806.44s]  Think she's a great champ. Like I've been getting shit on by Nila on my main account
[8807.76s -> 8822.56s]  Like a lot of Grandmaster Nila's have been dumpstering me. I think she's just really good at abusing solo queue
[8822.56s -> 8828.28s]  Like the the issue with Nyla is from what I've seen all the losses I've had with Nyla
[8829.20s -> 8831.80s]  People don't it's like the thing I was telling you about before
[8832.84s -> 8834.84s]  people don't play aggressively in
[8835.32s -> 8841.00s]  The lower elos like even in Grandmaster people don't play like aggressively enough. It sounds crazy to say that but it's true
[8841.36s -> 8844.90s]  they don't play aggressively enough in lane so you can get away with just picking Nyla and
[8845.46s -> 8850.64s]  Scaling and Nyla at like one item. You'll always be up in levels right because that's how the champion works
[8850.64s -> 8859.88s]  The champion works in like you'll always be up in levels because of her passive. So you basically just like scale through
[8860.20s -> 8862.72s]  Existing it's pretty it's pretty interesting
[8864.12s -> 8870.31s]  All right, so we're playing Cait Karma. Oh, I missed the minion because I suck
[8871.37s -> 8873.37s]  I'm gonna ward this bush
[8874.53s -> 8885.72s]  Just because I don't want the Rakan in the bush so now that the bush isn't warded anymore
[8886.34s -> 8889.78s]  Okay, warded it nice. I was gonna say what I want to do is I actually want to play
[8889.78s -> 8895.68s]  Oh, I suck. I actually wanted to play. Oh, man. I'm so bad at Cait
[8895.68s -> 8900.46s]  I wanted to play on the top side of the wave so that I'm not standing near the bushes, right?
[8900.96s -> 8902.96s]  because if you stand near the bushes
[8903.76s -> 8908.50s]  The Rakan can obviously like W me and I just get fucked. So I'd rather play in a safer spot. I
[8909.50s -> 8911.50s]  Can't wait to miss two CS. I'm so fucking bad
[8912.36s -> 8916.64s]  Now I want to push in wave three and I want to go buy a call. So I'm gonna ping to push
[8925.36s -> 8927.00s]  Okay
[8927.00s -> 8931.82s]  So I actually want to back here and I'm gonna go buy a call. So this is called a cheater recall
[8933.28s -> 8937.12s]  You usually have perfect CS to back on this timer
[8937.84s -> 8939.84s]  Go and you can go buy a call. Okay
[8940.32s -> 8944.32s]  This is like something that you can do if you're in a lane that's gonna be perma shoving
[8944.48s -> 8950.98s]  So what happens is the reason that's called the cheater recall is because we push the wave in they had to stay and form
[8950.98s -> 8953.02s]  The wave right now watch
[8953.66s -> 8961.31s]  They have to push this wave in right now if karma was here instead of roaming this roam is fine, by the way
[8961.31s -> 8964.05s]  But if she was here instead of roaming she could actually hold the wave
[8965.19s -> 8976.11s]  And if you notice here, I don't actually miss that many minions, right? We're chilling now. We can slow push this
[8976.19s -> 8978.93s]  We're safe. I should actually fast push this
[8979.71s -> 8983.01s]  Because I wanted to bounce. I don't want to so push this but I can't
[8983.01s -> 8993.39s]  Uh, I can't fast push this at level three by myself. So we're just gonna chill
[8994.69s -> 9000.57s]  Kaelin's really good at abusing like early lane phase bullying just based on like what our kit does
[9000.89s -> 9003.45s]  We see Rakan on the map topside. Did you guys see that?
[9004.45s -> 9011.13s]  So because we see Rakan, I can walk up a bit and we could play a little aggro here
[9011.51s -> 9022.46s]  You can kind of see like I don't have to play behind the minion wave. You see what I'm doing to this guy, right?
[9022.46s -> 9034.07s]  I hate this game. We can quit we can forfeit. It's fun. I hate this game. I really hate this game
[9034.79s -> 9042.68s]  Dude, what is wrong with me right now? It's like my brain doesn't work. It's the 280k nerf telling you so
[9047.72s -> 9049.72s]  Rakan's gonna be bought right now. I
[9050.64s -> 9052.48s]  Know he's gonna be bought
[9052.48s -> 9054.48s]  So I need to be a little care
[9054.76s -> 9062.37s]  Now my karma is here. There we go. So, you know, so I didn't use any spells. I'm not I'm just chillin
[9065.52s -> 9068.32s]  Dude, are you kidding me man?
[9068.52s -> 9076.38s]  I'm gonna be honest. I'm getting really tilted by these players now like the Rakan W's in
[9077.06s -> 9079.98s]  They just stand there and watch me die
[9081.42s -> 9085.58s]  Okay, it's fine. Listen, I'm not gonna get too mad about it. It's fine. I should have flashed the knockup
[9085.58s -> 9087.78s]  I guess even though in reality
[9087.78s -> 9092.22s]  I should never have to flash the knockup, but I should have flashed it because I can't trust the teammates
[9092.48s -> 9096.66s]  So what I'm saying is right there Karma and Fiddle were both right here. I was being chased down
[9096.90s -> 9099.74s]  They stood here. They didn't they didn't walk up to do anything
[9100.22s -> 9102.22s]  They just stood and waited
[9102.86s -> 9105.42s]  That pisses me off because I hate when players
[9106.62s -> 9108.38s]  play
[9108.38s -> 9115.39s]  Selfish and scared. It's my biggest pet peeve. It drives me fucking crazy, man
[9116.83s -> 9118.83s]  Sorry, i'm getting i'm losing my mind
[9122.78s -> 9129.72s]  Like it's so easy. It's fine though. I I shouldn't have walked up and egoed it. It's on me
[9141.28s -> 9148.81s]  I want to slow push this wave
[9148.97s -> 9154.57s]  I'm losing it
[9154.57s -> 9157.05s]  This by the way would be an example of a bad time for karma to roam
[9157.05s -> 9164.14s]  She needs to come back bot. There's absolutely no reason for her to roam on that timer
[9165.04s -> 9168.68s]  There's also no reason for her to be in that bush over there. We should be playing up to try it
[9168.68s -> 9172.56s]  We're playing k karma, right? We should be playing forward so that we can actually be aggressive
[9173.68s -> 9176.74s]  K karma is a lane bully lane. We don't want to sit here and just do nothing
[9177.00s -> 9180.00s]  If you pick karma, you want to be aggressive you want to be playing up?
[9180.00s -> 9182.96s]  You want to be stunning you want to be doing like aggressive things playing the game?
[9183.40s -> 9189.03s]  We're level six. I'd really like to like go in. Yeah, like
[9189.51s -> 9201.43s]  That was actually not bad by the karma she w'd the Zaya and then I got to trap off of it
[9201.43s -> 9203.31s]  So that wasn't too bad
[9203.31s -> 9204.63s]  Not the worst
[9204.63s -> 9224.22s]  Not not bad. That was good. That's good
[9225.40s -> 9228.94s]  Really nice really nice. Okay, so I'm gonna back here cuz I don't want to overstay for the wave
[9229.36s -> 9244.77s]  I'm gonna grab boots
[9245.81s -> 9249.64s]  You know, I think a lot of it is too I
[9250.44s -> 9254.76s]  Think a lot of it is people get really scared when they like Rakan is really strong in this meta, right?
[9254.76s -> 9258.44s]  Like he's very very powerful. He's like numbers are a little too high right now
[9258.44s -> 9260.44s]  So like everything he does is just a little too good
[9260.68s -> 9266.22s]  So I think people get nervous around Rakan especially with Xayah because it's like when people would get nervous around Nami Lucian
[9266.24s -> 9272.28s]  The lane like plays itself. It's very strong. It's very hard to beat but you can still see people making mistakes when they play the lane
[9272.28s -> 9274.12s]  So you got to watch for that type of stuff
[9274.12s -> 9289.27s]  Now a good way to play against a Xayah once you hit six is you don't want to
[9291.03s -> 9296.09s]  You don't want to ever walk melee range of her or give her the ability to just kill you with the feathers
[9296.09s -> 9300.63s]  Feathers, your main goal here is gonna be try and stay in a good spot when it comes
[9300.63s -> 9304.85s]  to Feathers, like I want to be to the side of her.
[9304.85s -> 9307.85s]  The side of her is the best option, like where she can't pull in, like I'll get
[9307.85s -> 9312.93s]  hit by maybe a few, but she can't pull in all of them.
[9312.93s -> 9316.57s]  That's a really key thing when playing versus her.
[9316.57s -> 9318.97s]  Because I remember back in the day I didn't know how to play Versailles and I would
[9318.97s -> 9321.49s]  always get fucking frustrated as shit.
[9321.49s -> 9325.49s]  So Rakan's 5, I want to hit tab, see Rakan's 5.
[9325.49s -> 9329.83s]  We shouldn't be able to die here.
[9329.83s -> 9336.26s]  I want to push this wave in, but I also need to stay away from where the Rakan can be.
[9336.26s -> 9341.08s]  So if you want to push waves in and reset the wave, make sure that you're standing
[9341.08s -> 9349.27s]  as far away as you can from where they can engage on you.
[9349.27s -> 9352.71s]  Now there are about to be six Rakanes, so they have a really strong level six,
[9352.71s -> 9354.63s]  she has pickaxe and noon quiver.
[9354.63s -> 9358.71s]  We do want to be a little hesitant here, we don't want to fight.
[9358.71s -> 9361.99s]  Now I'm gonna kind of push this in a bit.
[9361.99s -> 9365.19s]  We should have been spam pushing the whole wave, because that's how Cait Karma plays,
[9365.19s -> 9368.25s]  We just push, push, push, push.
[9368.25s -> 9371.69s]  But we played that early roam by Karma,
[9372.83s -> 9374.51s]  kinda put us behind on that.
[9375.65s -> 9376.49s]  It's not a big deal.
[9376.49s -> 9383.36s]  It's just something that we have to adjust.
[9383.36s -> 9388.32s]  Why does this say 88 and this say 90?
[9388.32s -> 9398.24s]  Which one is it?
[9398.24s -> 9407.69s]  Is it 88 or 90?
[9407.69s -> 9408.99s]  I mean, that guy's dead.
[9410.41s -> 9411.73s]  I don't know what that Karma's thinking,
[9411.73s -> 9420.20s]  but we probably have to give this drake.
[9420.20s -> 9424.56s]  I mean, maybe we could fight it if Fiddle had ulti, but him not having ult, yeah, there's
[9424.56s -> 9431.22s]  no way.
[9431.22s -> 9433.62s]  The higher one counts ward kills?
[9433.62s -> 9434.62s]  Why?
[9434.62s -> 9438.10s]  I think that's so stupid.
[9438.10s -> 9444.38s]  So they might try and engage here, unless they somehow know Fiddle's in the bush.
[9444.38s -> 9448.63s]  Which would be impressive, because we know it's not warded.
[9448.63s -> 9464.39s]  So that'd be pretty impressive if they knew that.
[9464.39s -> 9465.91s]  We could actually rift.
[9465.91s -> 9477.40s]  I'm just gonna ghost.
[9477.40s -> 9478.68s]  This is crazy.
[9478.68s -> 9488.74s]  the fuck oh this is interesting they saw fed 100% yeah i don't know where though it must
[9488.74s -> 9497.76s]  have because he used his thing but i'll use his uh whatever it's called his effigy i'd
[9497.76s -> 9507.82s]  have to go look one minion oh i guess i didn't see it uh i should back i can get
[9507.82s -> 9511.56s]  dove here we don't know where gragas is like if gragas happens to be like he ease
[9511.56s -> 9517.46s]  over this wall or something i can get dove really easy i'm greeting really hard
[9517.46s -> 9520.90s]  Rating usually gets you killed, typically.
[9520.90s -> 9524.46s]  I shouldn't be doing this.
[9524.46s -> 9528.68s]  They're not abusing it, but it's still like bad habits, right?
[9528.68s -> 9535.70s]  It's like, if you know something's gonna be a bad habit, you should not do it.
[9535.70s -> 9536.70s]  Just Q the bush.
[9536.70s -> 9543.42s]  Okay, that was, I meant use like an actual Q.
[9543.42s -> 9552.18s]  They could also be in the alcove, so I'm a little hesitant, but it's fine.
[9552.18s -> 9557.38s]  Okay, so the reason I stayed was because now I have my, I have my mythic, right?
[9557.38s -> 9560.34s]  Because we finished the coal and we finished the mythic at the same time, or finished the
[9560.34s -> 9561.34s]  wave, so.
[9561.34s -> 9567.86s]  Now I have two options, I can go galeforce here, uh, to dodge a lot of their shits,
[9567.86s -> 9573.38s]  or I can do what sounds like a fun option, we're gonna do shield bow.
[9573.38s -> 9578.40s]  I'm gonna show you guys why I like shield bow on Caitlyn.
[9578.40s -> 9584.66s]  It's not the best mythic, but it's good into certain comps if you don't wanna
[9584.66s -> 9593.94s]  get uh gal because i have alacrity this game i don't have bloodline right so i kind of want to go
[9594.50s -> 9608.45s]  shield bow and then i'm gonna end up going uh either ie or i'm gonna end up going like blood
[9608.45s -> 9616.45s]  thruster seconds ie or bt probably ie just because uh i think i think it's actually
[9616.45s -> 9627.24s]  easier to go ie this game but yeah this is a kind of boring game our team's doing really
[9627.24s -> 9657.16s]  well though so we just chill we got to be a little care okay it was kind of hard to do anything there
[9657.80s -> 9661.88s]  even though i got like a few autos on the gragas it's a little difficult to actually play the game
[9661.88s -> 9671.28s]  there because if i walk up too far like see where con's there if i walk up too far i just get
[9671.28s -> 9681.06s]  uh killed by recon all right i'm just gonna reset and go get boots typically ad carry is
[9681.06s -> 9693.59s]  really fucking boring uh in games like this where you can't really blow the game open oh i'm dead
[9694.23s -> 9701.80s]  maybe wait karma shield me i'm not dead nice fuck
[9721.40s -> 9734.77s]  motherfucker copied me man he was like oh we can fight this though they have no ults like this
[9734.77s -> 9735.77s]  This is actually fightable.
[9735.77s -> 9742.17s]  They have no Zy'ar and no Gragasar.
[9742.17s -> 9745.67s]  And this is also why it's really important that you relay to your team the cooldowns
[9745.67s -> 9746.67s]  of your team.
[9746.67s -> 9747.67s]  Remember that.
[9747.67s -> 9748.67s]  Don't forget that.
[9748.67s -> 9751.45s]  If somebody uses a big cooldown, tell your team.
[9751.45s -> 9754.25s]  Because that was an illegal dragon, right?
[9754.25s -> 9758.09s]  That was one of the most illegal things I've seen in a while.
[9758.09s -> 9778.36s]  Homie completely griefed that.
[9778.36s -> 9782.36s]  That's another very very very important thing that you need to take away from playing
[9782.36s -> 9783.36s]  League and being like...
[9783.36s -> 9785.36s]  This is what I was saying about the teamwork and shit earlier
[9786.36s -> 9789.84s]  Being good at the game is a lot of spreading knowledge as well, right?
[9790.92s -> 9796.00s]  Like if you if your team doesn't know if a flash is up or down you have to play completely differently, right?
[9796.40s -> 9799.88s]  like you got to think about the game and that in terms of that as well like how many times have you seen
[9799.88s -> 9804.16s]  Like, you know, you're like, oh I can walk up here if this guy can't flash ult me or something, right?
[9804.60s -> 9820.91s]  It happens all the time. I wonder if I can kill a duskblade Zed. I don't know. I probably could
[9820.91s -> 9838.21s]  Uh, I should go mad. What do you think about Teemo and other top lane as AD carry?
[9838.21s -> 9843.14s]  I play Teemo AD carry when I'm playing for fun sometimes
[9844.24s -> 9855.11s]  It's okay. Yo, go look on your game, man
[9856.09s -> 9860.13s]  So during the mid game as Caitlyn a few things that I can kind of teach you
[9860.13s -> 9862.05s]  This was kind of a boring lane phase, right?
[9862.05s -> 9868.89s]  Like we didn't really do that much the lane phase was essentially just like we died once and then you know everything all hell broke
[9868.89s -> 9869.93s]  was
[9869.93s -> 9871.93s]  When you're walking up to fights like this
[9871.93s -> 9878.48s]  make sure that you're putting traps down in places where the enemy has to walk
[9878.48s -> 9888.72s]  just like that playing 80 playing Caitlyn is not always about just like
[9888.72s -> 9892.76s]  autoing and getting QS and shits if you noticed during that fight I put two
[9892.76s -> 9896.66s]  traps here two traps here I forced the enemy team into like a location
[9896.66s -> 9903.95s]  where they had to eat traps or they they can't find us right and even if
[9903.95s -> 9909.54s]  like they avoid the traps they're still having to like move their
[9909.54s -> 9918.57s]  character in a very unique specific way that they probably don't want to do so
[9918.57s -> 9920.69s]  you should always be thinking where should I put these traps down at the
[9920.69s -> 9923.89s]  start of the fight not like how do I get autos off think about using your
[9923.89s -> 9927.25s]  traps to zone and to like control the teamfight before the fight starts
[9927.25s -> 9932.49s]  rather than using it to do damage because they'll step in the traps
[9932.49s -> 9937.41s]  themselves people will just people are stupid they're bad people aren't
[9937.41s -> 9942.25s]  paying attention everything I'm bad you know what I mean people can't pay
[9942.25s -> 9961.97s]  Attention to every bush that you're putting traps in during a big fight. It's it's too much attention span. Nobody has it nice
[9964.22s -> 9967.57s]  Grab this red. Oh
[9967.57s -> 9969.95s]  Big tip for all the ad carries in chat guys
[9970.77s -> 9972.29s]  I'll tell you right now
[9972.29s -> 9977.09s]  Once the 20-minute mark happens in League your junglers camps are no longer his I
[9977.93s -> 9980.41s]  Know I know junglers are gonna hate me for this
[9980.41s -> 9983.53s]  Okay, listen, if you're a jungle player, you're like fuck this guy now. I hate him
[9983.53s -> 9989.89s]  Listen, you know, it's true. You know at 20 minutes your camps no longer like they're not yours anymore, man
[9989.95s -> 9997.53s]  Okay, like you you you are full items at this point. Okay, like I want to be honest you would I'm taking your camps
[9997.97s -> 10014.07s]  I'm trying to get my third item as fast as humanly possible because 80 caries spike on three items extremely hard
[10014.07s -> 10024.43s]  I mean, I want to walk top, but we have no vision of this area. So it's a little scary
[10024.99s -> 10030.74s]  Like I said, I typically don't like to take
[10030.74s -> 10034.58s]  Like, jungles, camps, early game, ever.
[10034.58s -> 10038.72s]  Because like, that's why I say like at 20 minutes, usually you have two items at this
[10038.72s -> 10039.72s]  point.
[10039.72s -> 10042.74s]  If you're like farming decent and you know, etc.
[10042.74s -> 10045.16s]  Sometimes they'll be faster, but usually it's around average of like you'll have
[10045.16s -> 10049.13s]  your items at this point.
[10049.13s -> 10073.76s]  Always be tabbing to the team fights, even if you're farming as well.
[10073.76s -> 10075.00s]  Zed is in this bush.
[10075.00s -> 10080.48s]  Wait, where is he?
[10080.48s -> 10081.48s]  Wait, I'm stupid.
[10081.48s -> 10082.48s]  Where'd he go?
[10082.48s -> 10083.48s]  Oh, he died.
[10083.48s -> 10084.48s]  I killed him.
[10084.48s -> 10093.01s]  Wow, I'm really smart.
[10093.01s -> 10095.01s]  Like didn't notice that I killed that guy
[10095.89s -> 10097.61s]  I'm so dumb
[10097.61s -> 10111.16s]  80 carry brain right boys. I was like playing that so scared too because I was like I was like is he there
[10112.52s -> 10123.00s]  Pull the dragon out. Oh
[10123.84s -> 10129.16s]  I asked this yesterday, but what do you think the coolest looking dragon is? I swear it's the I
[10130.20s -> 10132.20s]  Think mountain drake looks fucking sick
[10168.92s -> 10171.76s]  Welcome to the time to push mid, right?
[10171.76s -> 10181.22s]  That's mainly because our Karma just got picked off and I don't want to give them the option
[10181.22s -> 10208.68s]  of pushing the wave so by pushing the lane, it takes away an option for the enemy.
[10208.68s -> 10210.72s]  That's something that a lot of people think like, oh I just want farm.
[10210.72s -> 10212.76s]  I don't care about the farm, right?
[10212.76s -> 10217.88s]  When I'm pushing waves in and shits during the mid game and I'm pushing a mid wave
[10217.88s -> 10224.40s]  in before a fight. If we're just sieging around the Baron, having that wave pushed in gives
[10224.40s -> 10228.98s]  us another option on what we can do in the game. And it takes you three seconds to push
[10228.98s -> 10235.82s]  it in. So if the fight's already over and you have time, always be paying attention
[10235.82s -> 10240.56s]  to trying to push in waves so that you can create a little bit of that pressure.
[10240.56s -> 10244.88s]  Yo, Hail, thank you so much for the 14, man. Welcome back. What do I get next?
[10244.88s -> 10253.71s]  I kind of want to get BT. I'm gonna get BT. I could get Dom's, but I think BT is better
[10253.71s -> 10258.41s]  because the, uh, I already have Overheal, right? So the shield from BT plus Shieldbow
[10258.41s -> 10264.05s]  plus IE, I don't think I'll be able to die. Okay, I think I'm unkillable. Actually.
[10264.05s -> 10267.89s]  Like, actually unkillable. So here, I'm gonna actually give these camps to Fiddle
[10267.89s -> 10287.30s]  because he's literally pathing to them. I don't want to be an asshole, but. Wow.
[10287.30s -> 10288.50s]  What just happened?
[10288.50s -> 10290.74s]  I'm bad.
[10290.74s -> 10293.66s]  I feel like I got hooked by Kled.
[10293.66s -> 10296.22s]  Oh, he flashed.
[10296.22s -> 10297.90s]  Okay.
[10297.90s -> 10301.34s]  I was like, I feel like what just happened was like I mispositioned because I went
[10301.34s -> 10302.34s]  up here, right?
[10302.34s -> 10304.72s]  Like I ghosted and went up here because there was two people here, two people
[10304.72s -> 10305.72s]  here.
[10305.72s -> 10308.78s]  I put traps down, these kind of sloppy traps, and then I positioned here and
[10308.78s -> 10312.78s]  then Kled flash Q'd me under the, yeah, okay, that makes sense.
[10312.78s -> 10315.92s]  I'm just bad.
[10315.92s -> 10322.35s]  It was okay though cuz if the entire enemy team has to literally
[10325.23s -> 10330.39s]  Like double flash on you to kill you under the turret and then your team follows up. It's not that big of a deal
[10330.87s -> 10332.87s]  Gale force would have saved me there though, actually
[10334.47s -> 10340.48s]  Low-key Gale force totally would save me
[10341.44s -> 10343.44s]  Cuz he has serpents
[10345.73s -> 10350.39s]  Serpents definitely shits on chill bow. I'm kind of stupid for going chill by this game. I
[10350.39s -> 10352.39s]  I
[10353.07s -> 10357.71s]  Wanted to try it out because I went up before when I was playing Caitlin like before the IE rework and everything
[10358.15s -> 10359.75s]  everybody would go
[10359.75s -> 10363.59s]  Or there was like one guy in challenger would go shield bow into shit every game
[10363.59s -> 10368.61s]  And I wanted to see if like it was still viable, but there might just be better options now like always scale force
[10369.71s -> 10376.16s]  BT or something. Oh my god. I flashed late. I'm dead
[10379.03s -> 10382.55s]  Dude, I flashed late for some reason. I'm so dumb
[10383.27s -> 10385.27s]  My bad
[10385.83s -> 10386.83s]  I'll just give him an Mb.
[10387.53s -> 10389.63s]  Like my brain is moving slowly.
[10390.23s -> 10391.93s]  Like I can feel it turning.
[10393.03s -> 10393.93s]  I'm just playing bad.
[10394.93s -> 10398.43s]  Like I was baiting the Kled to go in on me because Karma was there.
[10398.73s -> 10401.33s]  But what I need to do is I need to trap on top of myself when he goes in.
[10401.93s -> 10403.53s]  Then I need to Flash-knit.
[10404.03s -> 10405.03s]  And the Kled just dies.
[10407.20s -> 10408.30s]  You can also just kill him.
[10410.40s -> 10411.30s]  I was gonna say...
[10411.80s -> 10412.80s]  They have nothing.
[10415.70s -> 10416.90s]  We just play for dragon here.
[10422.34s -> 10423.94s]  I don't know why I'm playing so bad today.
[10423.94s -> 10427.44s]  I played bad yesterday too. I don't know what's going on. My like brain is broken
[10444.97s -> 10447.11s]  Dude, our con was trying so hard. Oh
[10482.43s -> 10490.37s]  I've made so many mistakes this game. I fucked up positioning mechanics farm
[10491.25s -> 10499.49s]  all kinds of shit, uh
[10499.57s -> 10509.79s]  I still don't want Lord Dom's actually I don't think Lord Dom's is good this game
[10510.65s -> 10515.11s]  Like they have no armor like Kled has murk treads
[10516.87s -> 10518.87s]  Which I feel like
[10519.83s -> 10534.86s]  Really bad indoor team, but oh a little tip that you guys can have for Caitlyn too when you are
[10535.98s -> 10537.98s]  Like Baron's up in 50 seconds, right?
[10537.98s -> 10543.40s]  So a little thing you can do that's actually kind of fun is you want to be at the objective before the like
[10543.72s -> 10545.56s]  Rule of thumb one of the objectives coming up
[10545.56s -> 10548.28s]  You always want to be on that side of the map before the before the objective comes up
[10549.14s -> 10550.96s]  but
[10550.96s -> 10552.96s]  You can put down traps
[10553.76s -> 10555.76s]  in the bushes
[10555.76s -> 10559.40s]  Around the objectives and people will face check them and you can just one tap on my game
[10561.16s -> 10563.16s]  It's actually incredibly fun
[10563.60s -> 10569.58s]  Like you just put them in the corners of the bushes where people have to walk
[10570.14s -> 10591.12s]  Like right here. I can put it right between the turret. I don't know why I didn't ghosts
[10592.00s -> 10599.31s]  I'll be honest. I have no idea. Why didn't ghosts I was like saving it for something. I'm not sure what
[10602.39s -> 10611.12s]  Next year a birthday present who the fuck knows. Oh, I could have one shot that guy if I was better at Kate
[10612.44s -> 10616.48s]  I did a really classic combo right there. I just didn't Q because I'm bad.
[10618.50s -> 10621.78s]  I should have- when he hit the trap your two headshots sit on him for a few seconds
[10621.78s -> 10625.66s]  So what I should have done is I should have instantly Q'd on top of the trap then auto-autoed and he would have died
[10626.14s -> 10631.26s]  Because your Q does the max damage when they're trapped too. So it would have been like just a perfect three shot
[10631.74s -> 10636.30s]  But like I said, I don't play Cait enough and my muscle memory is kind of trash sometimes so
[10637.62s -> 10651.02s]  That was my bad. Oh, we're getting cletted.
[10651.02s -> 10671.76s]  I don't know where he is, but I shouldn't have done that
[10672.60s -> 10678.81s]  I'm limit testing really hard right now. I suggest you guys don't limit test
[10678.81s -> 10680.33s]  Well, actually I do think you should limit test
[10680.33s -> 10684.07s]  But not if you want to win like play safer like right there the play wasn't to go back in
[10684.37s -> 10687.61s]  the play was to like back off, but I wanted to see if I could like I
[10690.24s -> 10692.24s]  Wanted to see if I was terrible or not
[10693.24s -> 10695.52s]  You know, I was
[10695.52s -> 10702.16s]  But yeah, I mean the combo with Cait is like if they're trapped you want to Q while they're
[10702.16s -> 10707.48s]  in the trap essentially because your auto will always give you the range.
[10707.48s -> 10714.04s]  So if you auto and then Q, when they're trapped they get, not a lot of people
[10714.04s -> 10718.72s]  know this because I just found this out like a few years or like after I should
[10718.72s -> 10721.10s]  have.
[10721.10s -> 10726.36s]  When you Q on top of a K trap, the way K's Q works is when you Q, the initial, like it
[10726.36s -> 10730.70s]  hits initially and then it does less damage to the targets behind it, right?
[10730.70s -> 10732.70s]  It's very narrow and then it like, it like gets bigger.
[10732.70s -> 10738.16s]  So when they're trapped though, it does the maximum Q damage that it can do in
[10738.16s -> 10741.98s]  like the isolation of the Q. So that's why when people are trapped, you want to
[10741.98s -> 10749.69s]  open up with your Q. You either want to net into the Q and then double auto or you
[10749.69s -> 10755.23s]  want to net or you want to like you want to queue then trap net at the same time then
[10755.23s -> 10760.23s]  double auto you basically it's a very interesting way to play you always want to try and overlay
[10760.23s -> 10765.91s]  a trap on your trap so when they get trapped you can overlay a second trap to either
[10765.91s -> 10769.43s]  but in front of them or behind them and what will happen is there's actually like
[10769.43s -> 10773.73s]  a little mini like i want to say one second uh cooldown of being able to be trapped
[10773.73s -> 10777.35s]  right like a little 1.5 to 2 second cooldown but what can happen is that you sit in
[10777.35s -> 10781.99s]  trap then what you can do is your net can slow them so you can you can actually queue in the
[10781.99s -> 10787.27s]  first trap then you can drop a second trap net slow them into the second trap and then triple
[10787.27s -> 10792.39s]  auto headshot them from all three of the net the two traps it's really complicated sounding
[10796.80s -> 10822.45s]  but this man just redeemed end my stream whenever you want what why why would you want
[10822.45s -> 10839.25s]  want to end my stream right now why would you want to be that guy wow okay
[10839.25s -> 10855.82s]  don't change don't end just change the camera position did you just spend one
[10855.82s -> 10862.89s]  million points to tell me to put the camera back on the right side of my
[10862.89s -> 10879.50s]  bucket no way no way you just did that I was like this man is just
[10879.50s -> 10884.54s]  flexing he's just like yeah I got some points to spare I guess I could like
[10884.54s -> 10904.39s]  throw them you know all right fine there's that better is that better
[10904.39s -> 10913.06s]  drink water actually that's a good one I'll be our be I'm gonna get some
[10913.06s -> 10920.43s]  water should we play in our main I kind of want to try and hit GM yeah
[10920.43s -> 10922.75s]  let's get on our main account it's like 1 p.m. so it's like 3 p.m.
[10922.75s -> 10931.21s]  Eastern I think I can get cues at the moment let me get some water and
[10931.21s -> 10942.98s]  And then, uh, we'll queue up, or we'll queue up then get some water real quick.
[10942.98s -> 10946.42s]  Because I think it's late enough in the day I can get queues now without waiting 40 minutes.
[10952.82s -> 10957.22s]  By the way, it is a teaching stream when I'm doing that, like, AD Carry Academy thing,
[10957.22s -> 10960.74s]  so if you guys have any questions you want to ask or, like, you guys can ignore that.
[10960.74s -> 10962.82s]  Uh, if you guys have any questions you want to ask or anything like that,
[10963.86s -> 10966.34s]  you know, if we're just chilling between games, just ask whatever you want.
[10967.22s -> 10970.42s]  I can answer a lot easier between games than I can in-game.
[10971.46s -> 10973.14s]  You know, it's a lot easier for me to see that shit.
[10973.14s -> 10977.72s]  I try and answer in game, but like sometimes I'm like focusing and shit. So it's a little harder
[10984.71s -> 10987.99s]  I'm getting some water though. So I'll be right back. Okay?
[10989.11s -> 10991.11s]  Talk amongst yourselves
[10991.27s -> 10994.73s]  Is Kraken troll on Cait? No, Kraken's good on Cait
[10995.59s -> 10999.83s]  You can go Kraken into Bloodthirster or Kraken into IE if you really need it. If
[11000.39s -> 11002.67s]  If they have like tanks, so they have like Sion
[11003.63s -> 11006.95s]  So Dwanee stuff like that that you have to like you're the only damage
[11006.95s -> 11011.87s]  Let's say you're like the only tank killer on the team. You're like the only ad damage. You have to go cracking sometimes
[11075.47s -> 11077.47s]  Breast air
[13573.49s -> 13585.27s]  .
[13585.27s -> 13592.24s]  .
[13592.24s -> 13607.41s]  .
[13607.41s -> 13611.41s]  .
[13611.41s -> 13617.24s]  .
[13617.24s -> 13621.24s]  .
[13621.24s -> 13625.24s]  .
[13625.24s -> 13632.44s]  past few seasons. He's actually not bad. He used to be a support main. Like he played Zerra support.
[13635.49s -> 13648.15s]  That's why I recognized his name. We should not go for this Rift. I'm on a bad timer for this
[13650.15s -> 13671.44s]  because I'm really low HP and mana. Ooh I don't have mana to arrow here guys. I do
[13671.44s -> 13674.84s]  I do not want to arrow that because the Fiora can totally,
[13674.84s -> 13683.24s]  the Fiora can do whatever it's called and the Fiora can,
[13683.24s -> 13685.24s]  what's it, whatever it's called,
[13685.24s -> 13686.56s]  W it if she's fast enough
[13686.56s -> 13689.14s]  and I didn't want to get my team killed.
[13689.14s -> 13691.80s]  The real issue here is that we're forcing,
[13691.80s -> 13695.68s]  okay, I'll tell you exactly what the real issue is.
[13695.68s -> 13698.48s]  We're forcing too many fights for no reason right now.
[13698.48s -> 13700.36s]  So like we're all forcing tons of fights
[13700.36s -> 13701.20s]  at the moment, right?
[13701.20s -> 13703.44s]  But there's no reason for us to force these fights.
[13703.44s -> 13709.50s]  That's that's why my team's getting tilted right like for some reason the Amumu and the
[13710.40s -> 13715.72s]  TF are both just like inting and they're both getting frustrated, but we actually win the game if we play it slow
[13717.32s -> 13720.32s]  Like we can we can slow play this game out in scale, but it just takes time
[13726.98s -> 13730.94s]  Because I specifically picked Ashe so that we could we had an answer for Sareh
[13731.66s -> 13736.30s]  Because we have TF and Ashe right? So we have we have a really good answer for him. The problem is
[13736.30s -> 13738.12s]  um
[13738.12s -> 13740.12s]  We need to like stop tilting and just like
[13740.74s -> 13742.60s]  Understand that we can deal with him later
[13742.60s -> 13747.48s]  He's not like a he's not like an a soul right like a soul is one of those champs that like you can't deal with
[13748.52s -> 13753.56s]  Why did my amumu wait to use ulti?
[13754.76s -> 13756.76s]  What?
[13756.80s -> 13758.80s]  He was in range I
[13759.92s -> 13768.16s]  Know he was oh
[13769.08s -> 13773.10s]  Nice. Okay. We got a kill. We need TF to play the game too, though
[13774.94s -> 13780.94s]  Our TF is really tilted, so he's just sitting bot.
[13780.94s -> 13785.80s]  Amumu is extra tilted too, but I mean, I'll be honest, the Amumu is playing worse than
[13785.80s -> 13790.02s]  TF, it's just that he's- dude I hate when stuff happens like this.
[13790.02s -> 13791.90s]  Stop pinging the guy, man.
[13791.90s -> 13792.90s]  He's already frustrated.
[13792.90s -> 13795.84s]  You pinging him is not gonna make him less frustrated.
[13795.84s -> 13798.98s]  You're just gonna piss him off more.
[13798.98s -> 13802.98s]  Like just play, dude.
[13802.98s -> 13806.34s]  We have a really good team comp.
[13806.34s -> 13814.68s]  Like we're behind right now, but we have a good team comp.
[13814.68s -> 13819.80s]  We should give this dragon by the way, like a thousand percent. We don't have tf holds
[13820.84s -> 13824.86s]  Like maybe maybe we could fight this but the morg's here so she can special my arrow
[13825.12s -> 13832.28s]  They got rift like we should give the drink. We also have no vision control of this area
[13833.44s -> 13838.12s]  So this is another thing of like why you guys wonder like why I play support in this elo
[13838.64s -> 13841.04s]  Like I get asked a lot. Why are you a support main now?
[13841.04s -> 13846.44s]  I'm still an ad main but the thing is it's really hard to play the game when your supports
[13846.44s -> 13852.06s]  don't ward correctly we can give this guys we can give it's not a huge deal
[13852.06s -> 13856.62s]  well Gnar's top we don't have to fight this guys we don't have to fight this
[13856.62s -> 13865.80s]  it's backup yeah like this isn't a fight it's only second dragon it's
[13865.80s -> 13881.88s]  nothing wow I suck at CSing but you see how little vision control we have
[13881.88s -> 13884.64s]  on the map right now we have one ward here and that's about it
[13884.64s -> 13889.48s]  vision control is I say it's 90% of the game in solo queue that's why I
[13889.48s -> 13893.00s]  like I feel like supports are like the unsung hero like when you get a support who knows how to
[13893.00s -> 13906.22s]  properly throw out vision control it feels insane we just gotta push I do have hawk shot and
[13906.22s -> 13913.98s]  in a second we can see if they're on this okay they're not I can voli we can back up
[13916.33s -> 13925.07s]  Kha'zix is above me right now okay Kha'zix wasted his ults that's not bad
[13926.99s -> 13931.63s]  we should back I don't want to take this fight TF could ulti but he's not
[13931.87s -> 13937.79s]  Like this is one of those moments where I actually think we actually could have killed
[13937.79s -> 13943.15s]  two of them right there, the FTF ulted, because they were out of position really hard.
[13943.15s -> 13953.54s]  But again, it's not like, I think they're going to walk, I think Kha'zix is, yeah
[13953.54s -> 13958.14s]  he's somewhere up here, I don't know where he is, and I can't hawk shot, I wasted
[13958.14s -> 13962.52s]  my hawk shot for this dragon, or this baron.
[13962.52s -> 13964.84s]  They could be on baron.
[13964.84s -> 13967.32s]  We need to check but I have no hawk shots.
[13967.32s -> 13968.32s]  Okay they're not, they're not, we're chilling.
[13968.32s -> 13969.32s]  Good, good.
[13969.32s -> 13984.20s]  I need a hundred golds.
[13984.20s -> 14002.39s]  Yeah I'm aware I'm getting ganked, I'm fully fucking aware, trust me.
[14002.39s -> 14005.15s]  I'm just trying to force them to make a choice.
[14005.15s -> 14019.88s]  Probably wasn't a great use of my ghost but, I say we bail, I need to go get
[14019.88s -> 14022.64s]  my item.
[14022.64s -> 14025.24s]  Ezreal's just pushing aside somehow, uncontested over there.
[14025.24s -> 14038.19s]  Somebody just TP'd bot, what?
[14038.19s -> 14040.85s]  What the fuck is this Amumu doing?
[14040.85s -> 14041.85s]  What is my team doing?
[14041.85s -> 14043.49s]  What are you guys doing?
[14043.49s -> 14053.54s]  This is so awkward, man.
[14053.54s -> 14056.10s]  I mean, guys?
[14056.10s -> 14058.66s]  Guys kill the Kha'Zix.
[14058.66s -> 14061.06s]  Oh thank god.
[14061.06s -> 14066.22s]  I don't know why Kha'Zix just dove to kill me of all people.
[14066.22s -> 14071.14s]  My man just like wanted me dead, he was like, yeah fuck that AD carry guy.
[14071.14s -> 14075.88s]  Like okay, sure.
[14075.88s -> 14078.44s]  Fuck me.
[14078.44s -> 14080.95s]  What do I want?
[14080.95s -> 14084.11s]  Feel like I need damage, but I don't know what gives me the highest damage here
[14084.97s -> 14086.71s]  maybe just
[14086.71s -> 14093.60s]  I don't know. Maybe just PD
[14094.54s -> 14103.78s]  I'm not actually sure. IE would be good, but it doesn't give me like more it gives me like IE is interesting in this position
[14105.48s -> 14108.04s]  Like I almost want more movement speed from the like PD
[14109.08s -> 14113.68s]  Even though normally like the utility is better. Like maybe BT is still the best and I'm just trolling
[14113.68s -> 14126.02s]  We can just do dragon right now. They have no TP or baron. I think we totally actually could do this
[14127.02s -> 14134.20s]  I'm down to try if you if you want to Rengar. They got two people bot. They're setting up for dragon vision right now
[14134.72s -> 14137.82s]  I'm actually kind of down to just try and play for Baron here
[14144.71s -> 14149.21s]  Like we could bait Baron here and force them to walk into us with my arrow
[14177.22s -> 14179.78s]  I want to stay together because I don't know where the Kha'zix is
[14182.67s -> 14194.32s]  Found him.
[14194.32s -> 14198.88s]  What is my Amumu doing? Dude, he has smite. Like I- pull it out if you're gonna do this, right? Like-
[14200.08s -> 14217.34s]  Like use your brain, man.
[14217.34s -> 14219.34s]  All right, now we do Baron though. We have to.
[14219.58s -> 14224.48s]  We have to do Baron.
[14224.48s -> 14228.88s]  This is like one of the worst players I've ever seen this Amumu. He has no clue what he's doing, by the way.
[14230.16s -> 14236.27s]  Like he's so dumb.
[14236.27s -> 14238.99s]  He's- he's like flaming the TF. He's- in his mind,
[14238.99s -> 14242.43s]  he's so angry at this TF that he's ignoring every single thing that's going on.
[14242.43s -> 14247.91s]  Like, he's ignoring that, like, the dragon was a bad call to begin with.
[14247.91s -> 14251.51s]  And if we are gonna do that dragon, we have to zone the fucking jungler because he has
[14251.51s -> 14254.35s]  fucking, uh, smite, right?
[14254.35s -> 14258.91s]  So it's like, like, what are you talking about, man?
[14258.91s -> 14261.11s]  These players are crazy!
[14261.11s -> 14263.77s]  It just feels to me like they're so angry at everything.
[14263.77s -> 14264.77s]  It's kind of funny.
[14264.77s -> 14267.92s]  Okay, I got three items now.
[14267.92s -> 14272.46s]  I went for the PD because I kind of think the extra movement speed and the extra, uh,
[14272.46s -> 14281.07s]  help a lot. I will say both the junglers are playing really well. This game is like interesting.
[14282.83s -> 14286.35s]  Like both the assassin junglers are playing pretty well. The enemy Xerath is playing pretty decent.
[14293.04s -> 14299.44s]  Uh what? That is not a... I mean that was embarrassing. Like I don't even have words for
[14299.44s -> 14313.38s]  that. Like I genuinely don't have words for that shit. I missed. I can't see. We have no
[14313.38s -> 14326.19s]  vision man like we have no vision nothing's warded because the mumu didn't put any wards down
[14329.47s -> 14333.79s]  so i can't fight because literally we're standing there in this area and there's
[14333.79s -> 14342.88s]  nothing warded the best part is all the mumu had to do was not die before that fight
[14342.88s -> 14348.80s]  and we auto win like we were winning so hard but this amumu is actually solo losing us the
[14348.80s -> 14359.69s]  the game with his fucking ego. God, support players are so bad at League! Actually! And
[14359.69s -> 14364.27s]  they'll deflect! Support players will lie to themselves about how good they are and
[14364.27s -> 14369.01s]  tell them that it's always their team's fault, but they'll drop 9 deaths, have
[14369.01s -> 14385.08s]  9 KP in a fucking 23 kill game, and then blame their fucking team. It's crazy. Please
[14385.08s -> 14408.27s]  ward things man oh my god he's dead again guys why are we up here top why are we top guys
[14415.21s -> 14424.49s]  why are we three manning top right now holy crap my teammates are absolute apes like what
[14424.49s -> 14439.24s]  am i watching man they they just three man's top oh my god like these are the worst players
[14439.24s -> 14441.24s]  I've ever fucking seen
[14441.56s -> 14446.52s]  Like we had the game in our hands and then all of a sudden my team's like, you know what?
[14446.52s -> 14450.44s]  I don't actually want to win and I'm like why and they're like, well you see I
[14452.08s -> 14457.68s]  Have an ego and you're like, oh I see this is why I can't play ad carry and see low
[14457.68s -> 14462.76s]  I'm sorry. I can't I have to play support in this yellow because ad carry is actually not playable
[14462.76s -> 14472.28s]  level when the entire game is decided by jungle, support, and mid. ADC does not decide any
[14472.28s -> 14477.62s]  of the League of Legends games below Grandmaster. Not one of them. Like last game, we popped
[14477.62s -> 14483.10s]  off and we won because we were the better ADC, right? This game, it doesn't matter.
[14483.10s -> 14488.66s]  Because TF does 11k damage, doesn't ulti bot more than one time. Like Rengar did
[14488.66s -> 14498.12s]  well, Gnar did well, but they also had a horrible macro. Like it is insane to me how easy support
[14498.12s -> 14503.16s]  is as a role and just how dog shit every support player is on the server. Like your
[14503.16s -> 14510.72s]  role requires zero thought. Your thought when playing support is do I get vision
[14510.72s -> 14517.74s]  or not? If no, where can I be the most useful? Your thought should never be this
[14517.74s -> 14522.97s]  This game's over, my team sucks.
[14522.97s -> 14523.97s]  It drives me ludicrous.
[14523.97s -> 14531.87s]  Like, I'm sorry that I have to play support on this account to climb, but it's crazy
[14531.87s -> 14535.87s]  how dogshit ADC is when you're solo queueing in Masters.
[14535.87s -> 14540.35s]  Like in GM, like if it's a full GM game, ADC is easy as fuck.
[14540.35s -> 14544.83s]  Like if everybody has a brain activity and they're not idiots, ADC is amazing.
[14544.83s -> 14545.89s]  Favorite role in the game.
[14545.89s -> 14549.05s]  When you're playing with people who don't know what they're doing and you're actively
[14549.05s -> 14554.09s]  trying to climb and improve, it genuinely feels like I'm pulling out a ball hair with
[14554.09s -> 14559.47s]  my tweezers or pulling out my ball hairs with tweezers like one by one.
[14559.47s -> 14560.47s]  It is so painful.
[14560.47s -> 14565.15s]  It's crazy.
[14565.15s -> 14569.96s]  Like, let's take a look at this.
[14569.96s -> 14576.30s]  This support main right now, 97 LP negative win rate, right?
[14576.30s -> 14581.82s]  I could I could literally tell that he was not a good player in the first 30 seconds
[14581.82s -> 14587.51s]  of that game.
[14587.51s -> 14594.44s]  I'm sorry I'm being mean, but this has been driving me crazy.
[14594.44s -> 14597.16s]  Like look at the support I had last game.
[14597.16s -> 14598.96s]  Also, can I ask a question?
[14598.96s -> 14601.40s]  Why am I even allowed?
[14601.40s -> 14604.84s]  Why am I even allowed to be in games
[14604.84s -> 14609.84s]  with a challenger support one game, I win the game,
[14609.86s -> 14612.52s]  then immediately it puts me in a game
[14612.52s -> 14620.66s]  with a 97 LP master support.
[14620.66s -> 14627.85s]  What is this matchmaking?
[14627.85s -> 14634.57s]  This is insane.
[14634.57s -> 14658.14s]  That's crazy.
[14658.14s -> 14665.23s]  I don't even, I'm wondering why.
[14665.23s -> 14667.27s]  Sorry, I'm gonna go on a rant for a second.
[14667.27s -> 14669.15s]  Why is this allowed?
[14669.15s -> 14670.83s]  Why can you be in a game?
[14670.83s -> 14673.07s]  Why can I be in a game with a literal guy
[14673.07s -> 14675.03s]  who's about to promote to challenger?
[14675.91s -> 14676.75s]  Right?
[14676.75s -> 14679.69s]  We win the game and then the very next game,
[14679.69s -> 14684.94s]  it puts me in a game with a guy who's 97 LP.
[14684.94s -> 14700.95s]  This is insane.
[14700.95s -> 14702.91s]  Sorry, that's just frustrating as fuck.
[14704.15s -> 14709.22s]  Because it's like such bad game design, right?
[14709.22s -> 14712.00s]  Like that's 900 LP difference.
[14718.02s -> 14721.06s]  And the thing is, this guy doesn't have good MMR.
[14722.32s -> 14724.94s]  Right? Like it's not like this guy has good MMR.
[14726.28s -> 14727.28s]  Right?
[14727.82s -> 14729.60s]  Because look at his games.
[14729.60s -> 14731.90s]  He's playing with all masters players.
[14731.90s -> 14735.66s]  They're all like 100 LP masters, 70 LP, 30 LP, right?
[14737.04s -> 14737.96s]  It doesn't make sense.
[14737.96s -> 14740.16s]  It's not like his MMR is high.
[14740.16s -> 14744.96s]  So why is this guy getting into like a 600 LP Grandmaster game?
[14746.24s -> 14748.24s]  Why are we putting that guy in the game?
[14748.56s -> 14750.64s]  That's so frustrating. Sorry. I just I needed events
[14757.16s -> 14759.16s]  How do you know which ad carry to pick in each situation?
[14759.56s -> 14762.36s]  Uh, it's a lot of knowledge a lot of knowledge
[14764.36s -> 14766.36s]  Like you have to know
[14766.84s -> 14768.36s]  A lot of shit
[14768.36s -> 14773.96s]  Like what the enemy champions do what your champions need to do to win the game what the win cons are
[14774.92s -> 14776.72s]  You can just pick
[14776.72s -> 14778.72s]  it would be honest though, you could just pick a
[14779.48s -> 14785.72s]  Like there are 80 carries in the current meta where you can just pick their blinds like I was making it to your list
[14785.72s -> 14786.84s]  I forgot about it
[14786.84s -> 14789.64s]  But I mean you can blind pick Jinx pretty much every game
[14790.96s -> 14795.08s]  Like Jinx is just blindable every game pretty much. She's insane. She's super OP
[14795.88s -> 14799.14s]  So like if you if you ever just want to play a champion and you think like, okay
[14799.14s -> 14801.52s]  I want to practice ad like Jinx is insane super good
[14801.52s -> 14805.47s]  um
[14805.47s -> 14810.91s]  Draven's not blindable, but I do think he's really good if you're good at the game. Draven's very good
[14811.87s -> 14815.49s]  He's he's he's harder than Jinx by a mile like Draven's a lot harder
[14815.77s -> 14819.55s]  But he's definitely like good at carrying with a lead as well
[14820.11s -> 14824.50s]  Like another blindable ad that I think's like a tier is like Varus
[14825.04s -> 14829.34s]  You can blind pick Varus really easily because Varus doesn't really have counters
[14829.34s -> 14835.42s]  like he doesn't get countered by anything he's more of like a you can pick him and
[14835.42s -> 14840.34s]  then go even and your ulti will always be useful you can look to like win lane
[14840.34s -> 14870.87s]  you can look to like engage things like that right okay so this game as
[14870.87s -> 14876.41s]  the support I need to be tracking the jungler so I'm gonna think where
[14876.41s -> 14879.97s]  always be thinking what the enemy jungler wants to accomplish and how
[14879.97s -> 14885.61s]  to stop it that's like a pretty big tip of advice I can give you guys like think
[14885.61s -> 14888.25s]  to yourself like okay if I was the enemy jungler what would I be wanting to do
[14888.25s -> 14892.27s]  against this Graves right as Lee sin he's probably gonna want to either
[14892.27s -> 14899.61s]  gank early like gank bot early or he wants to invade on certain timers right
[14899.61s -> 14902.21s]  because that's like what Lee is really good at is ganking and
[14902.21s -> 14909.01s]  invading so what I think I'm gonna try to do this game is I'm gonna try
[14909.01s -> 14914.61s]  and watch for early ganks and early pressure bot lane, like your level 2, level 3 ganks.
[14914.61s -> 14920.05s]  We're still going to be aggressive, but Lux took TP, which means this Lux does not plan
[14920.05s -> 14922.33s]  on playing aggressive at all.
[14922.33s -> 14927.45s]  Like she basically, if anybody takes TP like this in a lane, I already know from start
[14927.45s -> 14930.21s]  of the game that they're not planning on doing anything.
[14930.21s -> 14932.99s]  So I'm probably going to end up roaming a lot this game.
[14932.99s -> 14949.12s]  This is going to be a game where I roam a ton.
[14949.12s -> 14951.12s]  We do have some good lanes to roam to too.
[14951.12s -> 14970.14s]  Top and mid is both really good. I just want her to ward early because I don't want to get shit on by Lee
[14971.38s -> 14973.08s]  so
[14973.08s -> 14975.08s]  Okay, I'm just gonna flash immediately
[14975.98s -> 14981.66s]  There's no reason to not flash there because Alistar used this flash to get my flash, which is totally fine
[14981.98s -> 14986.12s]  It's better for him because he has hex flash, but it's not that bad
[14990.52s -> 14993.66s]  Because I can out range him and I can stay away from his
[14994.40s -> 14999.18s]  His shit, so we know he's in the bush. We just chill
[14999.74s -> 15004.56s]  There it is, he fucked up, now we go forward.
[15004.56s -> 15007.90s]  I don't know why Lux isn't throwing spells at this guy, like, I don't know why she didn't
[15007.90s -> 15009.84s]  Q him.
[15009.84s -> 15013.62s]  Like he fucked up, the Alistar should have died there.
[15013.62s -> 15015.20s]  And she's pinging me, okay.
[15015.20s -> 15016.38s]  The Alistar should have died there.
[15016.38s -> 15020.42s]  If Alistar ever fucks up on engage like that, where he hex flashes in, gets stuck,
[15020.42s -> 15023.80s]  like Q his cooldown, yeah I don't know why it was thrown is what I'm saying.
[15023.80s -> 15029.86s]  You don't throw spells that aren't gonna land.
[15029.86s -> 15034.38s]  So there's no point in Lux ever throwing her Q until Alistar fucks up the combo.
[15034.38s -> 15039.06s]  Like she should just poke with E, and then, because it's almost like a Blitz hook, right?
[15039.06s -> 15040.62s]  Think of it like a Blitz hook.
[15040.62s -> 15043.62s]  If she throws the Q out, right?
[15043.62s -> 15049.14s]  Now they have an opportunity to be aggressive because they know the hook is down.
[15049.14s -> 15053.98s]  So it's better for her to just hold the hook, essentially, right?
[15053.98s -> 15058.46s]  Hold the Q, and now when Alistar does go in, they have to be nervous about
[15058.46s -> 15063.02s]  that Q because they can't just think oh the Q's down let's let's engage right so
[15063.02s -> 15072.09s]  they can't actually think about that this is why I don't like a lot of the
[15072.09s -> 15079.05s]  time doing this like push push the wave they can't engage on us without
[15079.05s -> 15086.81s]  like flashing so it doesn't matter like look did she Q the wave again
[15086.81s -> 15094.15s]  or am I an idiot like just oh man I'm losing my mind here oh these I'm
[15094.15s -> 15101.17s]  I'm tilting. It's fine. I need to not tilt. I need to just chill, but I'm getting frustrated because we're like not using
[15101.65s -> 15103.83s]  cooldowns properly and it's driving me fucking crazy
[15107.56s -> 15111.30s]  Because these are very simple things to do you guys got to walk the wave in by the way
[15111.30s -> 15114.40s]  You can't let them freeze. Okay, they're very simple things to do
[15114.40s -> 15116.26s]  I know I'm being annoying as shit whining about this
[15116.26s -> 15121.62s]  But this is stuff that you you need to be thinking about when you're playing the game. Well, you should actively be thinking
[15121.62s -> 15129.82s]  uh what can i do with my champion's toolkit to stop their champion's toolkit and you should
[15129.82s -> 15136.12s]  be thinking okay i have q right so what do they want to do they want to go in okay
[15136.12s -> 15142.84s]  and when you're thinking they want to go in right you should be thinking okay when
[15142.84s -> 15148.12s]  they go in i can just q and that should be your entire thought process your thought
[15148.12s -> 15153.76s]  process should never be oh maybe i can land a random q at max range and we can
[15153.76s -> 15161.14s]  get a kill she cued the wave yes that's what i mean like you should never cue the wave
[15161.14s -> 15167.20s]  on lux either unless you're going to 100 reset that would be like if i hooked the wave
[15167.20s -> 15173.92s]  as like blitzcrank or some shits why is my lux bait pinging my graves dude i gotta
[15173.92s -> 15180.76s]  keep this 100 honest with you man you don't get you you don't get to be mad
[15180.76s -> 15189.82s]  here why are dude these players are such babies jesus christ what pussies man these
[15189.82s -> 15194.01s]  These people are such babies.
[15194.01s -> 15197.91s]  The Graves played correctly, by the way, like 100%.
[15197.91s -> 15200.21s]  He's mad at the Graves for taking a wave.
[15200.21s -> 15203.73s]  He wanted to not, like, he wanted to be able to TP back and get the wave.
[15203.73s -> 15208.13s]  That's what, this Lux is so trash that she actually believes that it's the Graves'
[15208.13s -> 15214.81s]  fault, that Graves misplayed by pushing the bot wave, but it was the right play.
[15214.81s -> 15218.57s]  Pushing the bot wave was the correct play there, because then she doesn't have to TP.
[15218.57s -> 15222.33s]  The whole reason that he's pushing it is to save her teleport, so that she doesn't have
[15222.33s -> 15227.94s]  to TP to lane.
[15227.94s -> 15231.84s]  Players like this are why the game is hard to play right now in the current meta.
[15231.84s -> 15233.68s]  Why it feels bad.
[15233.68s -> 15235.40s]  Because this Lux is trash.
[15235.40s -> 15237.20s]  You guys can all see this Lux is terrible.
[15237.20s -> 15240.08s]  She's already made a bunch of mistakes, she's blaming her team, she's being a
[15240.08s -> 15242.16s]  dipshit right?
[15242.16s -> 15251.13s]  But she can climb up to this elo being this bad because of the system, the current
[15251.13s -> 15268.67s]  system in place.
[15268.67s -> 15276.81s]  We should immediately do Baron here, Dragon, I mean, we should do this, come.
[15276.81s -> 15279.33s]  You don't have time for this, just come do Dragon.
[15279.33s -> 15288.35s]  Bro, the Lee Sin just showed top, we should be doing Dragon.
[15288.35s -> 15301.98s]  When um, when this shit happens by the way, where you have um, enemy jungler shows
[15301.98s -> 15306.38s]  on one side of the map, you should always be playing on the other side of the map
[15306.38s -> 15308.54s]  to make a counterplay.
[15308.54s -> 15312.90s]  So jungler shows on top side, we go for Dragon, right?
[15313.38s -> 15321.02s]  Yo, be careful Alistar is going to be there Xerath is going to be there just leave
[15321.66s -> 15327.23s]  Just leave, leave of leave. I'll do it for you. I'll make you leave. I got you man
[15329.66s -> 15332.84s]  but we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and
[15332.94s -> 15336.98s]  I need to back now, but we had a timer just now where their bot lane had to back and
[15337.66s -> 15339.66s]  not only did their bot lane have to back but
[15341.22s -> 15350.70s]  The enemy was top. I tried man. I tried to flash Q him
[15350.70s -> 15359.36s]  But yeah, it's it's really I don't know a lot of junglers don't I don't think they know what they're I'm dead
[15359.36s -> 15362.72s]  By the way, I'm not even gonna pop exhaust. I'm just dead a
[15363.88s -> 15370.46s]  Lot of junglers don't know what the goal of the game actually is a lot of them think it's a thousand bat in sec
[15370.46s -> 15374.40s]  But a lot of junglers think the goal of the game is to like get as much farm as you can and run
[15374.40s -> 15378.52s]  Over the enemy team and shit, but it's actually it is but it's also about like
[15379.20s -> 15383.38s]  Getting early objectives and turning those small leads into big leads through objective control
[15383.62s -> 15386.82s]  Right?
[15386.82s -> 15389.24s]  So like right now, I want to rotate top.
[15389.24s -> 15392.44s]  Rift is up, I know Lee Sin's gonna be on top side of the map right now.
[15392.44s -> 15397.78s]  I wanna rotate top so that I can help my team by being in the top side of the map.
[15397.78s -> 15399.58s]  Because that's where the next play is gonna be made.
[15399.58s -> 15413.16s]  Well the play is made mid, but I mean I'm here so it's fine.
[15413.16s -> 15418.64s]  Oh my god.
[15418.64s -> 15423.42s]  I did not think the fucking Lee Sin would be there too.
[15423.42s -> 15429.42s]  Oh, oops.
[15429.42s -> 15430.42s]  This is rough.
[15430.42s -> 15437.30s]  really know how to how to play this because i got there in time to counter the gank right
[15437.30s -> 15444.64s]  i exhausted the guy saved the xerath i got there in time to counter the gank but oh
[15444.64s -> 15455.35s]  well played that's actually mega well played that was really good i want to push this
[15455.35s -> 15468.62s]  wave in but i can't like uh you guys are noticing there's no objectives taken on
[15468.62s -> 15473.90s]  map yet at 10 minutes which is kind of crazy the ally is doing really good the alistar is not a
[15473.90s -> 15495.22s]  bad support player he's playing well like he's playing very well a lot of this is more of like
[15495.22s -> 15500.42s]  i need i don't have anything to do on the map because uh i'm trying to help my jungler but my
[15500.42s -> 15506.74s]  jungler is trolling it's really rough because like i'm trying to rotate over and help my
[15506.74s -> 15511.38s]  jungler on cooldown basically right but my jungler doesn't want to fight you see like
[15511.38s -> 15524.74s]  I'm countering the Alistar's fight or ganks. It's just I'm just dead, dude
[15526.98s -> 15533.30s]  Like we shouldn't have made that play mid because we knew that they were all there and we knew that our jungler is doing this
[15534.66s -> 15536.98s]  This might just be a jungle diff, honestly
[15538.66s -> 15542.72s]  Like our adc sucks, but it might just be a straight-up jungle diff game. They do happen
[15544.50s -> 15548.30s]  Especially in this elo where jungle has so much control of the game. They do happen
[15553.12s -> 15555.92s]  It's a pretty big jungle diff, Chipoppa, you know it. I know it.
[15557.68s -> 15561.12s]  Like yeah, he's saying yeah, like he knows the jungle is getting outclassed
[15561.76s -> 15572.29s]  insanely hard. Because Graves counters Lee Sin. It's a massive counter. But this guy doesn't
[15572.29s -> 15579.17s]  know what he's doing. I think he's a Rengar one trick and Rengar got banned. I think that's
[15579.17s -> 15584.77s]  what's going on. It's a Rengar one trick who got banned out and he tried to play a champion
[15584.77s -> 15590.39s]  champion that requires thought, not just a I jump you die champ, right?
[15590.39s -> 15596.94s]  And he just gets shit on for it.
[15596.94s -> 15601.16s]  I mean dude, I can't even do anything this game.
[15601.16s -> 15608.67s]  Our top laner is getting his ass whipped too, it's really fucking rough.
[15608.67s -> 15613.65s]  I mean he's in here, I'm pretty sure, he's not, it was warded though.
[15613.65s -> 15620.81s]  I mean we can't really do anything here, I'm dead I think, yeah I'm just dead.
[15620.81s -> 15621.81s]  This is just rough.
[15621.81s -> 15626.41s]  I, I, I kind of want to go next because I don't think, I don't think we have the skill
[15626.41s -> 15629.69s]  on the team to win.
[15629.69s -> 15634.01s]  The jungle diff is huge, the AD diff is huge and I'm just, I can't, I can't impact
[15634.01s -> 15648.04s]  the map.
[15648.04s -> 15651.00s]  Like I, I can't, I just can't do anything this game to impact the map and it feels
[15651.00s -> 15652.00s]  really bad.
[15652.00s -> 15667.96s]  Oh, son of a bitch, I should have flashed.
[15667.96s -> 15670.24s]  I got like creep blocked a little bit when he knocked me in, I like had to walk
[15670.24s -> 15672.60s]  through, I should have just flashed up, that's my bad.
[15672.60s -> 15674.16s]  Like what was that TP man?
[15674.16s -> 15679.52s]  God get me out. I'm gonna be a hundred percent real get me out. That's EP was miserably bad
[15680.24s -> 15682.24s]  Dude, just TP to the wave
[15690.70s -> 15695.96s]  Like what is our blocks doing to like I just feel like everybody's late to the fights
[15697.58s -> 15699.58s]  Lux is always late to the fights
[15700.06s -> 15703.96s]  The graves doesn't want to take fights, even though he's playing graves and Elise in
[15704.64s -> 15707.64s]  Like I I feel like oh, this is rough. This is a rough game
[15708.54s -> 15710.84s]  Games like this tilt me and I kind of just want to go next
[15711.74s -> 15715.94s]  Because games like this, they are winnable, but I feel like I want to go next to save mental, you know?
[15716.94s -> 15718.94s]  Like, lowkey, I just want to save my mental.
[15729.18s -> 15731.18s]  Because, ugh, that's so gross.
[15732.68s -> 15736.98s]  Like, watching what Lux did in the early stages of the lane phase, just wasting her Q on repeat,
[15737.28s -> 15739.88s]  that was one of the most embarrassing things ever, and then...
[15740.28s -> 15741.88s]  Like, look at that, she just Q'd a minion!
[15753.48s -> 15753.98s]  Ooh.
[15756.79s -> 15758.69s]  Bro, like, oh my god.
[15759.39s -> 15760.39s]  You gotta push the wave, man.
[15764.33s -> 15765.33s]  Holy shits.
[15765.33s -> 15777.24s]  I mean, I can't even walk. Oh my god. I
[15779.04s -> 15784.04s]  Don't even have help from my fucking team that's the worst part about this
[15788.40s -> 15791.64s]  Dude these games feel so unplayable man
[15793.52s -> 15797.20s]  Like I don't know how else to say it except for they just feel miserable to play
[15797.20s -> 15806.04s]  Like I'm trying to focus on playing like improving myself, but it's so hard to know how to improve in games where like
[15807.94s -> 15809.94s]  You genuinely just
[15810.08s -> 15811.84s]  Get no help
[15811.84s -> 15824.13s]  My Lux has been tilted since like minute two for some reason and my graves has been completely pathing wrong doing wrong shit
[15824.65s -> 15828.93s]  It's hard to know how to help like I went mid to help countered two of the early ganks
[15829.59s -> 15831.59s]  Lux still griefed the game
[15831.59s -> 15836.40s]  So like yeah, it's just it's hard to know and then top lane lost
[15837.20s -> 15841.60s]  It's so rough, man
[15841.92s -> 15851.65s]  Like I'm gonna keep it a hundred percent honest with you. If you are a one-trick do not try and play other champs
[15853.11s -> 15854.79s]  You you will int
[15854.79s -> 15864.50s]  You will play badly always and you will int and you will you will like look at this. This is
[15865.50s -> 15867.50s]  2.9 K damage as a
[15867.62s -> 15869.62s]  Dude, like what are we doing?
[15869.66s -> 15875.40s]  How are these people getting into this elo?
[15875.40s -> 15880.56s]  How does this Lux like in the game?
[15880.56s -> 15889.08s]  She was against an Alistar bot and she did 1.2.9k damage in a 16 minute game against
[15889.08s -> 15891.36s]  a melee heavy team?
[15891.36s -> 15893.04s]  Like what is this?
[15893.04s -> 15895.36s]  What is happening?
[15895.36s -> 15903.67s]  This guy was d4 30 LP last season and now he's magically in Masters?
[15903.67s -> 15910.65s]  No, we need to fix matchmaking.
[15910.65s -> 15917.40s]  This is this is insane.
[15917.40s -> 15918.96s]  Like this is just a matchmaking diff.
[15918.96s -> 15920.86s]  It's nothing else.
[15920.86s -> 15926.92s]  My man literally does not belong in master tier 400 LP MMR.
[15926.92s -> 15927.92s]  At all.
[15927.92s -> 15929.40s]  Like you can see that he's not at this level.
[15929.40s -> 15946.70s]  Dude, I have the Lux player on my team again?
[15946.70s -> 15949.59s]  Ugh.
[15949.59s -> 15961.99s]  There's a Xerath one trick and a Rengar one trick on the enemy team.
[15961.99s -> 15963.79s]  I don't know man.
[15963.79s -> 15970.96s]  I guess I care more about the Rengar than the Xerath, but this is rough.
[15970.96s -> 15984.39s]  Oh, what's up Chipoppy?
[15984.39s -> 15988.63s]  Dude, sorry I hit yes on that, man. I know the game was winnable, I'm gonna be real,
[15988.63s -> 15992.39s]  but dude, you didn't see what I saw during the early game of that game, Chibabi.
[15993.03s -> 16003.06s]  Like, man, the entire early game of that game was like, we lost lane because Lux wouldn't
[16003.06s -> 16010.10s]  use her Q to fight the Alistar, she was using it to farm minions. Like, she was so
[16010.10s -> 16015.30s]  scared of being engaged on by the Alistar and the Kalista that she would use her Q to max
[16015.30s -> 16020.82s]  range farm minions instead of save it so when the alistar engages we just kill him.
[16022.58s -> 16027.38s]  right because if alistar ever engages on me and lux he just gets killed. we just bind him walk
[16027.38s -> 16034.74s]  away and he's stuck there and he dies right? but for some reason she didn't understand how
[16034.74s -> 16038.10s]  to do that so she was just throwing it to farm so we would just get engaged on.
[16038.10s -> 16042.42s]  so i started roaming and every time i was like roaming to an objective or something
[16042.42s -> 16045.62s]  The Graves would always walk away and not fight.
[16045.62s -> 16048.32s]  Like, he wasn't attempting to fight, he was basically just like,
[16048.32s -> 16049.82s]  Oh, I'm gonna go farm some more.
[16049.82s -> 16051.32s]  But I'm like, dude, you can't do that.
[16051.32s -> 16053.62s]  Like, if the Alistar's ganking mid and I'm countering mid,
[16053.62s -> 16055.82s]  You can't just farm before coming mid.
[16055.82s -> 16058.02s]  Or you can't just, like, not take dragon and shit like that, right?
[16058.02s -> 16060.82s]  Like, it blows my mind that these players can get-
[16060.82s -> 16062.12s]  Like, it's like this guy too.
[16062.12s -> 16064.32s]  Same thing, like that jungler last game, right?
[16064.92s -> 16065.62s]  Look at this.
[16065.62s -> 16066.92s]  It's the same thing as the last game.
[16066.92s -> 16070.32s]  Like, NA is riddled with this shit, and it's so miserable to play.
[16070.62s -> 16072.32s]  Look at this. This jungler last game, right?
[16072.32s -> 16075.36s]  He's not he's what like a d1 player, right? He's not a bad player
[16075.36s -> 16077.92s]  He peaked d1 but why is this guy in this game now?
[16078.14s -> 16084.40s]  He like artificially inflated to the C. Low getting lucky with his first few games and now we have to play with this guy
[16084.40s -> 16093.17s]  Oh, it's an account share the person it's a different player. Look on the account
[16094.63s -> 16100.86s]  D flash f flash so I it's a fucking account share
[16102.79s -> 16111.86s]  That's that's frustrating
[16111.86s -> 16115.06s]  Sorry for whining so much guys. This shit's just really frustrating to me
[16116.42s -> 16123.06s]  Like I know I should play it to like specifically only care about like improving and then while you're improving you'll climb automatically and shit
[16123.36s -> 16125.38s]  but it's really frustrating when like
[16127.08s -> 16131.34s]  The players in the game would rather be idiots and assholes to each other than play the game
[16131.54s -> 16137.18s]  Right like the game before the amumu right the game before this the amumu was being toxic the whole game and into
[16137.18s -> 16142.74s]  The win away the last game the Lux and the graves were being toxic to each other the whole game. We entered the game away
[16143.46s -> 16145.46s]  It's like I
[16145.54s -> 16151.26s]  It's it's not fun to lose because one player gets mad at another player over them both being idiots
[16151.82s -> 16156.95s]  I'm sorry. It's not fun. It's so unfun
[16158.19s -> 16175.46s]  But we'll try and we'll try and win this one. All we can really do is try and carry the games, right?
[16176.80s -> 16178.64s]  It's about it
[16178.64s -> 16188.92s]  What is
[16188.92s -> 16191.78s]  What?
[16191.78s -> 16198.06s]  What man? What what do you think they're gonna do to me? Welcome to the League of you know, think of the seven months man
[16198.06s -> 16202.02s]  Welcome back. I really don't want to meet all I don't I don't want to mute all
[16202.58s -> 16218.41s]  Because like I I want to like value the pings and shit, but dude if they walk up I'm gonna flank them
[16219.05s -> 16221.05s]  That's why I'm standing here
[16253.18s -> 16257.24s]  That's a big cue. I need to get level two first here hundred percents
[16257.24s -> 16278.21s]  I should have just been autoing there that whole time
[16278.21s -> 16284.81s]  Because we have heal so she should have just walked up and autoed as soon as this is what
[16284.81s -> 16289.83s]  I mean by tracking cooldowns as soon as the neeko missed her as soon as the neeko Mr.
[16289.83s -> 16297.33s]  Cool down sushi Mr. E the ashes just walked up and immediately started fighting right
[16297.33s -> 16303.59s]  like because they can no longer kill us the neeko doesn't actually have spells outside
[16303.59s -> 16308.77s]  of her E right so she misses that snare and she used her W to write so it's like
[16308.77s -> 16317.25s]  We just go ham you don't need to be too scared it happens quite a bit sometimes where people will just be like really nervous
[16335.32s -> 16338.68s]  Damn if I had dodged that queue, I actually would have killed all three
[16339.56s -> 16340.68s]  damn
[16340.68s -> 16344.44s]  I don't know if it was worth the flash after the guy. I actually I think it was if I had dodged the queue
[16344.52s -> 16346.44s]  I would have been fine
[16346.44s -> 16350.44s]  So that was that it's whatever. I also doesn't miss any creeps here
[16351.00s -> 16356.45s]  So it's not the end of the world
[16356.45s -> 16359.49s]  Like i'm pretty sure lee sin did not have his top camps by the way
[16359.49s -> 16374.24s]  Damn, if I was a little better mechanically, I'd turn that by the way, 100%.
[16374.24s -> 16399.38s]  We should push this wave, so that I can go get vision, because yeah, that guy can't
[16399.38s -> 16416.61s]  freeze that wave, so, it's not too bad.
[16416.61s -> 16432.37s]  Lee Sin's top, you can kind of see some really good, what is this?
[16432.37s -> 16435.17s]  Why is my Karthus AFK at turret?
[16435.17s -> 16454.06s]  What is happening right now?
[16454.06s -> 16455.06s]  Why was he AFK?
[16455.06s -> 16470.32s]  I mean, I guess it worked out. But yeah, maybe you had to go let his cat out and I don't know
[16472.64s -> 16481.82s]  Happens we do their ballings not very good
[16483.02s -> 16485.28s]  They're trying too hard to force fights that they can't win
[16485.84s -> 16492.46s]  Like they they genuinely can't win half these fights that they're trying to force
[16493.78s -> 16498.28s]  Maybe if they were against people who like don't push their buttons they could win those but it's like all I have to
[16498.28s -> 16500.28s]  Do is stand there and fight back and they lose
[16500.54s -> 16504.42s]  They're on dragon a thousand percent right now. There's not a lot I can do about that
[16505.84s -> 16512.24s]  We just have to chill. There's almost nothing I can do about it. Kaisa's trying to fake act like she's big, but it's
[16515.75s -> 16517.75s]  There's just nothing we can do
[16519.24s -> 16529.15s]  Cuz our card is top so we just chill. Did I finish the tier list? No, no, no, not yet
[16530.47s -> 16533.87s]  Whoa
[16533.87s -> 16535.87s]  Lee Sin could be bot right now
[16537.51s -> 16541.91s]  Mmm, I don't think it's too bad if he's bot though. They can't really dive us especially with card assaults
[16541.91s -> 16565.00s]  Why, why does my Ashe just run?
[16565.00s -> 16577.32s]  She like just straight up runs away, it's kinda silly.
[16577.32s -> 16585.70s]  Cause we have, we have Karthus ulti, like we can win a fight bot right now.
[16585.70s -> 16588.62s]  I guess, I guess I'm just gonna have to get them low enough for Karthus to kill
[16588.62s -> 16590.82s]  them.
[16590.82s -> 16594.18s]  Like without the Ashe's help.
[16594.18s -> 16597.97s]  Which I think I can do, it's not too bad.
[16597.97s -> 16600.91s]  Okay the Akali's coming bot.
[16600.91s -> 16611.02s]  We just kill them, I mean let's just fight.
[16611.02s -> 16615.34s]  I don't know why, we should just Ashe arrow, honestly.
[16615.34s -> 16616.34s]  Just Ashe arrow.
[16616.34s -> 16623.77s]  Okay, that was pretty bad Ashe arrow, but...
[16623.77s -> 16631.26s]  Filled?
[16631.26s -> 16635.82s]  Uh, I don't think he's filled, I think he's just having a bad game.
[16635.82s -> 16637.82s]  It happens, you know?
[16637.82s -> 16642.92s]  Whoa, okay.
[16642.92s -> 16643.92s]  Do it.
[16643.92s -> 16645.22s]  Ult me, I fucking dare you.
[16645.22s -> 16653.28s]  I'm trying to keep some mana, so that I can ulti.
[16653.28s -> 16668.86s]  Oh, Karthus already used his ults.
[16668.86s -> 16675.78s]  Fuck.
[16675.78s -> 16687.20s]  both backed there wow my bad i honestly didn't think they were both gonna back there like i
[16687.20s -> 16693.36s]  thought the kaisa was gonna back right where i saw her like last that was my bad i should be
[16694.88s -> 16701.42s]  i think lee sin can come bot here and kill me i should actually stop this guy's back
[16706.75s -> 16710.51s]  yeah i should stop his back because it's more value to stop the back now
[16710.51s -> 16714.59s]  even if lee sin isn't bot it's more value because he's so low
[16714.59s -> 16724.27s]  I wasted my ult though which makes me kinda scared.
[16724.27s -> 16734.57s]  The other thing that kinda sucks about this is we don't have good vision and I can't
[16734.57s -> 16739.45s]  really help anybody on the map because the same thing is happening as before.
[16739.45s -> 16745.14s]  We're missing opportunities to get kills on timers.
[16745.14s -> 16747.34s]  I mean the dog lightning guy is playing fine this game.
[16747.34s -> 16752.82s]  I think he's trolled a lot, like he's trolling, this isn't his best game.
[16752.82s -> 16756.28s]  It's also I don't know why we're getting so tilted around the map right now
[16757.02s -> 16759.96s]  because if I'm if I'm being honest, we should just win the game off of like
[16761.52s -> 16781.01s]  Being better players, I don't know what this car this is thinking but do it do it
[16782.33s -> 16784.33s]  Hardest we can fight we can fight just fight
[16787.10s -> 16789.10s]  Bro, what are we doing?
[16790.38s -> 16795.66s]  I'm losing it man. Ah, no, no, no, I'm tilted. I'm tilted as fuck. He didn't walk in
[16795.98s -> 16798.70s]  Just go on to the Akali shroud man
[16800.38s -> 16804.22s]  Like just walk a foot to your right and stand on the akali shroud
[16804.86s -> 16808.70s]  She just eats your damage like while she's in the shroud. She can't stop that
[16812.93s -> 16814.93s]  Holy shit. I'm losing my minds
[16816.86s -> 16820.94s]  Like ash is just inting bot waves right now not trying to do anything
[16822.38s -> 16826.78s]  Locks is really far up on cs, which is really good, but i'm losing it man
[16828.78s -> 16831.02s]  Like we we see exactly where they are every game
[16831.02s -> 16837.02s]  Like we see where everybody is on the enemy team permanently and we still can't manage to like walk to the right location
[16837.78s -> 16841.72s]  This is driving me crazy
[16841.72s -> 16846.24s]  My my Karthus 80 my Karthus jungle is getting out farmed
[16846.84s -> 16850.68s]  Like a Karthus jungle is getting out farmed by a Lee Sin jungle. That's insane
[16851.64s -> 16854.58s]  Like I don't think I don't think I can stress enough how crazy that is
[16855.28s -> 16860.42s]  Like there should never be a world where Karthus ever gets out farmed
[16861.18s -> 16867.31s]  No way
[16867.31s -> 16874.99s]  I'm dead dude. No way. I just fucking ate the end of that now. I'm playing that just kill the Lee sin, man. I
[16884.42s -> 16886.42s]  Fucked up there
[16886.90s -> 16890.78s]  That was my fault cuz I got hit by the tip of the that was my fault
[16890.78s -> 16894.38s]  I got barely clipped by the tip of the neeko ults when I was trying to space cuz I'm bad
[16895.26s -> 16899.08s]  And if I was alive there and I could have saved my flash for the Lee sin Q we just win
[16899.08s -> 16905.25s]  I am confused at why we decided to like not fight that immediately though
[16905.25s -> 16910.45s]  Like, we- we caught out two of their members and we just got scared for whatever reason.
[16910.45s -> 16912.73s]  Wait, we win this, fight.
[16912.73s -> 16928.66s]  We a thousand percent win this, fight this, fight this, fight this.
[16928.66s -> 16932.38s]  Bro, do not throw a fucking temper tantrum right now.
[16932.38s -> 16935.02s]  There's one kill, do not throw a temper tantrum.
[16935.02s -> 16940.79s]  Oh my god, here we go.
[16940.79s -> 16951.80s]  I took one kill, the guy's about to lose his mind, guys.
[16951.80s -> 16952.80s]  I need to mute all.
[16952.80s -> 16955.76s]  I'm gonna mute all in a second.
[16955.76s -> 16958.04s]  Like I I can't with these people right now
[16961.08s -> 16963.48s]  Like I can't man. You people are disgusting
[16964.68s -> 16966.68s]  like you guys just
[16966.68s -> 16971.36s]  Wine you play bad you wine and you bitch about every little mistake that everything happens
[16971.52s -> 16973.16s]  Even though it's like in the middle of a fight
[16973.16s -> 16978.56s]  I guarantee I'm a better player than you are and you're still whining and crying over one shutdown that like
[16979.08s -> 16985.28s]  You didn't even walk to until I spam pinged you like I literally 1v2 them you hit 1e and now you're mad
[16985.28s -> 16991.03s]  Dude, I swear, League players are fucking psychopaths.
[16991.03s -> 16997.77s]  At least I got the exhaust off.
[16997.77s -> 16999.65s]  Surely she dies, right?
[16999.65s -> 17001.33s]  Surely she dies here.
[17001.33s -> 17002.33s]  Or not.
[17002.33s -> 17003.33s]  Okay.
[17003.33s -> 17006.49s]  Okay, at least she died.
[17006.49s -> 17009.09s]  Help each other, guys.
[17009.09s -> 17010.09s]  Help each other?
[17010.09s -> 17012.98s]  Teamwork?
[17012.98s -> 17013.98s]  Teamwork, teamwork, teamwork.
[17013.98s -> 17014.98s]  Teamwork.
[17014.98s -> 17021.17s]  Wait, this Ashe is insane.
[17021.17s -> 17028.87s]  Okay, I'm not gonna lie, that Ashe played that so good.
[17028.87s -> 17031.07s]  I only saw the end of it and she still played that good
[17032.47s -> 17034.47s]  That was sick
[17034.95s -> 17041.24s]  Well, well done that was actually really good she almost stopped the dive
[17042.16s -> 17052.48s]  That's crazy. This game is definitely 1000% still winnable though. We just have to play
[17053.40s -> 17059.46s]  For late game and not lose our fucking minds. I'll let that push back into my ash. I'll go mid and get some vision
[17062.24s -> 17064.24s]  That's pretty much all we have to do
[17064.24s -> 17072.20s]  Play for late and not lose our mind early.
[17072.20s -> 17077.28s]  We could play to kill the Sokali right now, she doesn't know, there's no ward here.
[17077.28s -> 17084.79s]  We could also invade here, oh that's so unlucky.
[17084.79s -> 17113.96s]  That was such a close Q. Kill that guy.
[17113.96s -> 17114.96s]  Jesus Christ.
[17114.96s -> 17122.23s]  I feel like we should have won that fight.
[17122.23s -> 17125.21s]  I feel like something awkward happened and we lost.
[17125.21s -> 17129.19s]  Did my Ashe just walk directly into the Sokali and not use her ulti?
[17129.19s -> 17130.19s]  Use your ulti.
[17130.19s -> 17131.19s]  You have ulti.
[17131.19s -> 17132.83s]  Use your ulti?
[17132.83s -> 17142.24s]  Oh my god.
[17142.24s -> 17146.01s]  What the fuck?
[17146.01s -> 17148.73s]  Oh my god.
[17148.73s -> 17151.99s]  I don't even know what to say right now.
[17151.99s -> 17154.69s]  This is insane.
[17154.69s -> 17158.37s]  This genuinely feels like everybody in the game is losing their mind in the freest
[17158.37s -> 17164.06s]  game I've ever seen in my life.
[17164.06s -> 17167.00s]  Like that's what we're losing to, right there, that guy.
[17167.00s -> 17170.90s]  The guy who like doesn't understand how Senna works.
[17170.90s -> 17172.32s]  Like that player.
[17172.32s -> 17173.32s]  That's why I'm frustrated.
[17173.32s -> 17177.76s]  That player right there has no idea how Senna works,
[17177.76s -> 17181.00s]  tries to fight me, and we're like losing to that guy.
[17181.84s -> 17183.84s]  Like I'm trying really hard not to be an asshole,
[17183.84s -> 17186.56s]  but like it's flooding out right now from these games.
[17188.28s -> 17192.62s]  It's crazy.
[17192.62s -> 17194.94s]  Like he's so toxic, look at this.
[17194.94s -> 17197.94s]  He went proto-belt Ionia-boot Niko,
[17200.46s -> 17219.20s]  but like that doesn't do anything to help his team.
[17219.20s -> 17220.20s]  You could arrow that guy.
[17220.20s -> 17225.20s]  I mean, it's not impossible or don't and that's fine.
[17236.17s -> 17237.23s]  Oh my God.
[17243.27s -> 17248.25s]  Guys, I think my Lux is AFK.
[17248.25s -> 17256.69s]  She's been sitting in base for like five minutes.
[17256.69s -> 17259.69s]  I think she's like literally just scrolling
[17259.69s -> 17261.37s]  or some shits.
[17261.37s -> 17273.58s]  All right, let's push this wave.
[17273.58s -> 17280.46s]  We could make a pick right now.
[17280.46s -> 17281.90s]  Jax, what are you doing man?
[17281.90s -> 17283.02s]  Why are you up there?
[17283.02s -> 17285.89s]  Oh no.
[17285.89s -> 17288.29s]  Also, why does this Ashe have the worst build
[17288.29s -> 17315.74s]  ever seen dude if we lose to the kaisa that just did that i'm gonna lose my mind like that guy just
[17315.74s -> 17320.94s]  blind art in without any vision of anybody and just died there's just no way we can lose this
[17324.56s -> 17331.95s]  we got this guys just play like i just need to i need help getting vision control on baron
[17332.83s -> 17417.63s]  and mid and then we can we can win we got this right now i mean we still got baron but
[17417.63s -> 17423.02s]  He didn't get two of them, I guess. Oh, no, we only yeah, you got card this in ash
[17424.42s -> 17436.53s]  But we did get Baron, which is very nice. I'm gonna go Dom's this game. I might go
[17438.93s -> 17457.36s]  Black cleaver, but I think I'm gonna go Dom's I need to get vision control on dragon and min
[17457.36s -> 17473.25s]  I need to get vision control and I need I need help to do it though
[17474.37s -> 17476.37s]  I'm gonna act like I'm backing here
[17483.66s -> 17486.60s]  We should just be pushing mid with Baron. I don't know what we're doing
[17486.64s -> 17491.88s]  Like, like lowkey it should just be straight up like we go mid with baron here.
[17491.88s -> 17522.40s]  What the fuck was that, that was a terrible play.
[17522.40s -> 17534.26s]  Guys just come mid, we have baron.
[17534.26s -> 17537.78s]  Nice huge pick, push mid, push mid.
[17537.78s -> 17538.78s]  Fuck dragon, just push mid.
[17538.78s -> 17551.20s]  Okay now we back off.
[17551.20s -> 17557.90s]  Oh, I mean that was bad.
[17557.90s -> 17560.14s]  Guys back off, back off, back off, leave.
[17560.14s -> 17566.76s]  Leave leave leave please, please just leave.
[17566.76s -> 17568.18s]  Guys you can leave, you can leave.
[17568.18s -> 17573.44s]  We can just go do dragon, leaf.
[17573.44s -> 17574.88s]  We still have so much gold to get on the map.
[17574.88s -> 17578.52s]  We can go get bot tier two, bot tier one, bot tier two.
[17579.44s -> 17580.96s]  We have so much gold to get on the map.
[17580.96s -> 17581.80s]  It's not a big deal, right?
[17581.80s -> 17584.22s]  Like we don't need to end the game right this second.
[17584.22s -> 17588.46s]  We actually have Karthus and we have Jax too.
[17588.46s -> 17620.16s]  So like our scaling is really good.
[17620.16s -> 17635.38s]  I need to go get my next item,
[17635.38s -> 17636.98s]  but I need enough gold to do it.
[17639.10s -> 17641.22s]  I also need to go get wards.
[17641.22s -> 17645.60s]  This sucks, I'm on like a weird buy timer where like I don't have enough things to get.
[17645.60s -> 17647.48s]  You know what, I'm just gonna get my ward item.
[17647.48s -> 17650.90s]  I'm gonna grab this for right now just so we can actually get some power on the
[17650.90s -> 17651.90s]  map.
[17651.90s -> 17655.14s]  Because the map's so dark, you know, I think getting the ward item before finishing
[17655.14s -> 17662.36s]  my last whisper item is probably the smartest call.
[17662.36s -> 17668.80s]  I am a little concerned why we're not pushing bot with Jax, we're pushing top.
[17668.80s -> 17674.04s]  And I'm also concerned why we're not playing for mid prio and we're just farming bot
[17674.04s -> 17685.76s]  side this is such an awkward fucking thing like we should just be playing for mid prio
[17685.76s -> 17689.98s]  and use arrow to engage that's how we win we just use arrow to engage when they can
[17689.98s -> 17708.90s]  test mid it's actually that easy like low key it's actually that easy see watch
[17708.90s -> 17721.55s]  now this guy's dead i mean that's fine with me you guys want to int to kill me
[17721.55s -> 17740.08s]  that's totally fine they can get the inhib and then they can back up yeah yeah get
[17740.08s -> 17748.52s]  hit back up and then play for play for baron they'll only have a few seconds to do this
[17748.52s -> 17758.25s]  though so it's kind of scary because these two are going to be alive they need to back
[17758.25s -> 17767.45s]  immediately just reset you don't need the wave just leave leave baron's up baron's
[17767.45s -> 17774.48s]  up think about the macro guys the macro we play for baron now because there's
[17774.48s -> 17778.36s]  a timer now where like you guys just need to reset because there's a timer where
[17778.36s -> 17786.76s]  the enemy has tempo on the map and if we don't uh if we don't allow if we don't reset they'll
[17786.76s -> 17800.11s]  just rush baron and there's nothing we can do about it okay they're not on baron i think
[17800.11s -> 17803.39s]  they missed their timer they're on it no no they're on it they're on it they're
[17803.39s -> 17814.33s]  on it okay they're not on it we're fine we can still fight this though but we
[17814.33s -> 17826.28s]  need everybody here just arrow arrow ash arrow arrow arrow it doesn't matter if you hit
[17826.28s -> 17841.62s]  mouth just arrow just arrow him thank you no guys the back line the back line play together
[17841.62s -> 17856.87s]  play together yes nice end of the game you end you end here lux don't back you are
[17856.87s -> 17861.87s]  giving me cancer okay they forfeit it dude look how easy that is look how easy it
[17861.87s -> 17870.19s]  is to win games when people are listening to macro look how easy it is oh my god i'm losing it man
[17870.19s -> 17874.83s]  i swear to god i'm losing my i can feel my hair falling out right now i can feel it falling out
[17874.83s -> 17880.67s]  of my fucking head like like i just lost one it's right there but like it's just fucking
[17880.67s -> 17890.03s]  kill me man in game god it's so hard i feel so exhausted like it's so exhausting
[17890.03s -> 17903.98s]  you played a 44 minute gold game? God damn! That's impressive. I don't want to
[17903.98s -> 17908.62s]  honor any of these people. Who would you guys honor? Like out of all of them who
[17908.62s -> 17911.56s]  would you guys pick? Because I don't know they all suck. In my eyes I'm too
[17911.56s -> 17921.41s]  toxic right now they all suck. Jax? Alright I'll give it to Jax. Ash? Ash was
[17921.41s -> 17929.78s]  trying I'll give you that. Ash was trying. Dude look at this Lux. This Lux
[17929.78s -> 17950.01s]  got so fucking carried oh my god oh my god don't type to me you pedestrian
[17961.14s -> 17989.22s]  like oh yeah yeah wow fucking pedestrian like it's not even an insult man dude
[17989.22s -> 17993.22s]  Guys, I feel like part of my life gets taken away, you know?
[17993.22s -> 17998.22s]  Like, when I play on my main account and I'm like super sweaty, tryharding and shit,
[17998.22s -> 18003.22s]  I feel like I'm losing like, yeah, it's like every time I lose, it's like one hair.
[18003.22s -> 18005.22s]  Or like every time I'm like barely win.
[18005.22s -> 18011.22s]  Right? It's just like every game in this elo is like one hair on my head gets fucking burnt out and just leaves.
[18011.22s -> 18032.33s]  And I'm gonna be looking like Homer Simpson.
[18032.33s -> 18037.45s]  Like look at the difference in wards placed. This is what annoys me about bad support players
[18038.21s -> 18040.21s]  This guy plays 23
[18041.07s -> 18044.93s]  He's more focused on getting kills than placing wards and it's really stupid
[18050.92s -> 18052.44s]  Sorry, I just don't listen
[18052.44s -> 18057.84s]  I don't have anything against the dog lightning guy as a person other than like what I've seen on his stream, right?
[18058.12s -> 18061.72s]  Like on his stream. He just seems really egotistical
[18061.72s -> 18068.52s]  Like he's like everything I hate in the average league player. He's he has a massive ego
[18069.48s -> 18075.48s]  Because he reached challenger on the support role on like an off meta pick like last year at some point or something
[18075.48s -> 18079.32s]  Or maybe he's challenger right now. I don't even know maybe he has an account in challenger
[18079.32s -> 18082.60s]  I don't even know but it drives me crazy because like
[18083.12s -> 18089.02s]  He doesn't do anything correctly like he gets away with such dumb shit
[18089.02s -> 18094.10s]  Because he like he like basically wins lane because he plays extremely aggressively
[18094.70s -> 18101.18s]  But if you guys noticed in that game the reason we won lane or where we were able to push back is because they played
[18101.18s -> 18106.22s]  Aggressively, but they did it really stupidly like they were fighting us in our own waves
[18106.90s -> 18110.58s]  Right like on repeat. They were just fighting us in our own waves every time
[18110.58s -> 18116.26s]  I would just turn a one-for-one almost a one-for-two every time and it's it's stupid because every time that's happening
[18116.26s -> 18121.44s]  They're also giving me souls right and he would like take weird fights and like I know he's probably for fun
[18121.44s -> 18126.04s]  He doesn't care. It's a smurf blah blah blah, but I just don't like when people like that like ego their ass off
[18126.88s -> 18128.88s]  When they play so badly
[18129.40s -> 18131.10s]  It drives me crazy
[18131.10s -> 18137.03s]  Why do I care so much? I don't know. I
[18137.83s -> 18160.48s]  Don't know how you guys doing by the way
[18161.16s -> 18164.26s]  How's everybody's day going in chat? What you guys up to talk to me?
[18164.26s -> 18167.60s]  I know I stopped like teaching the game and started whining
[18167.60s -> 18171.10s]  like I got on my main account a few hours ago and I stopped teaching and I
[18171.10s -> 18180.99s]  started whining a bunch so my bad my bad on that one dudes how you guys doing
[18180.99s -> 18191.56s]  though how's everybody's day gone when the coaching services open oh I could
[18191.56s -> 18197.44s]  probably do coaching at some point soon like I'd be willing to do some
[18197.44s -> 18201.26s]  coaching some like sub coaching or something or like something like that
[18201.26s -> 18213.22s]  it might be fun sucking in bronze you don't get enough time to
[18213.22s -> 18216.58s]  actually improve dude I feel that man it takes a long time League is not an
[18216.58s -> 18220.96s]  easy game to pick up and start playing right like if you're if you're in bronze
[18220.96s -> 18223.36s]  or silver and you're like oh I actually you know I'm having fun playing the
[18223.36s -> 18226.36s]  game I kind of want to try and get better it's you're just overwhelmed
[18226.36s -> 18230.72s]  with so much info that you like have to play so many games right like I
[18230.72s -> 18256.30s]  feel you man like it's it's overwhelming yeah I I feel you well
[18256.30s -> 18264.16s]  we got mid okay uh should I just play tryst well I'm worried if I pick tryst
[18264.16s -> 18270.60s]  that we won't have AP, but I also think I'm better at Trist than I am at like, other stuff.
[18270.60s -> 18284.53s]  So I don't know. AP Varus? I'm not good enough at AP Varus, man. I'm gonna be real.
[18284.53s -> 18291.16s]  Well, my Malz is good, but the problem with Malz is like, Malz is a shitty champion.
[18291.16s -> 18298.44s]  Like, Malz is trash, right? So like, he's good, but he's like, not good in the sense of
[18298.44s -> 18304.68s]  like I can play him well but at the end of the day if they pick something that like counters
[18304.68s -> 18314.26s]  malz I just lose whereas like tristana is just free to pick like even if we play all ad right
[18314.26s -> 18318.02s]  let's say we do all ad or some shit like on accident or because people are one tricks blah
[18318.02s -> 18323.54s]  blah blah it's it's still free like tristana is still like a good pick because even with
[18323.54s -> 18329.06s]  all ad she's still like you can build lord dom's she has incredibly high pressure early
[18329.06s -> 18333.54s]  game if you play her right right like you could push the waves roam uh you can you can roam top
[18333.54s -> 18338.10s]  roam bot help lanes out like level two three you can invade junglers early like she's just
[18338.10s -> 18345.61s]  incredibly incredibly strong this guy should go pike i was gonna say they picked new new and
[18345.61s -> 18352.97s]  i picked an 80 mid they picked new new and thresh we should have an engage because because
[18352.97s -> 18368.18s]  pike trist like i can just walk bot on repeat now and pretty much kill people watch
[18368.18s -> 18372.02s]  an iron game watching an iron game i i feel like it wouldn't be an actual iron game though would it
[18375.75s -> 18382.71s]  i've heard i had friends who like intentionally lost a bunch of games uh and so they could get
[18382.71s -> 18387.27s]  to iron 4 right they like they like into down to iron 4 or whatever to see if they could
[18387.27s -> 18398.15s]  make it and uh there's just so many like smurfs in iron there's like legitimate bot
[18398.15s -> 18404.23s]  bot accounts like like accounts that are like being botted right there's like
[18404.23s -> 18416.98s]  botted accounts in iron there's like smurfs all over the place it seems to have stopped
[18416.98s -> 18422.98s]  i wonder if riot like did something that stopped the bots they must they may have like
[18422.98s -> 18430.90s]  they may have just think incorporated something that like stops the software but i don't know
[18430.90s -> 18435.70s]  i haven't heard anything about it but i have no clue i'll be real i don't know
[18435.70s -> 18461.85s]  You had a tech fall you were around last game and got boots one
[18461.85s -> 18469.05s]  Dude that sounds awful
[18469.05s -> 18474.65s]  I kind of feel bad for actual iron players who are like
[18474.65s -> 18492.74s]  In iron trying to climb because like that sounds bad
[18492.74s -> 18495.62s]  I do think you can climb obviously out of any elo it doesn't matter right
[18495.62s -> 18500.76s]  Like if I were to go into an iron game I'd probably drop like 50 kills
[18500.76s -> 18504.66s]  But I so I do think you can climb out of any you know any elo for sure
[18504.66s -> 18523.68s]  You're leveling a new account? A few days ago you had a bot account that answered every time I wrote bot?
[18530.58s -> 18539.47s]  That's funny
[18539.47s -> 18541.39s]  Yeah, I assume that's a good point
[18541.39s -> 18544.87s]  I guess if you're in iron you could like play to learn the game a bit better
[18544.87s -> 18548.63s]  And then you could like play a new account and see where you got. Yeah, I know that would work
[18549.63s -> 18551.07s]  That makes sense
[18551.07s -> 18560.40s]  Sure, I'll first pick men. I'll first pick Senna. I
[18563.74s -> 18565.74s]  Guarantee they lock in fucking
[18565.74s -> 18569.74s]  These people are gonna walk in fucking Nautilus or some shits.
[18569.74s -> 18577.74s]  It'll be like Jarvan, Nautilus, I don't even know.
[18577.74s -> 18585.70s]  Riven's not too bad for Senna, it's okay to get flanked.
[18585.70s -> 18587.70s]  I actually don't think Riven's too bad right now.
[18587.70s -> 18591.70s]  Maybe all the Riven players I've played against suck, but I don't think she's actually that bad.
[18591.70s -> 18594.70s]  I think Riven's like just, you have to position well.
[18594.70s -> 18597.70s]  I think Riven's really broken at abusing positioning.
[18598.34s -> 18601.80s]  That's why she's so good. It's all a queue like good Riven players
[18601.80s -> 18607.00s]  I'll get really gross flanks and the flanks are what's OP. Yeah, there's the Gragas
[18607.00s -> 18609.12s]  Okay, I was like, they're gonna pick something to fuck me over
[18609.76s -> 18614.88s]  This guy picked Gragas, but it was gonna be like j4 or Gragas or something
[18615.76s -> 18618.36s]  And then this guy is the support. He'll probably pick Nautilus
[18620.00s -> 18622.00s]  Unless he's a one trick
[18622.40s -> 18626.44s]  Right like unless this guy's straight up just like a one trick. He'll pick like Nautilus or some shits
[18626.44s -> 18631.52s]  Maybe Rakan. Rakan or Nautilus.
[18631.52s -> 18637.82s]  Cause if he picks an Enchanter, we just win the game.
[18637.82s -> 18643.37s]  He has to pick Engage.
[18643.37s -> 18649.86s]  Melio would be really good here too, actually.
[18649.86s -> 18652.86s]  Cause Melio would counter half our team.
[18652.86s -> 18656.86s]  You can Melio-Q Wukong and Kennen-Engage.
[18656.86s -> 18660.86s]  Like if this guy played Melio, this would actually be a hard lane.
[18660.86s -> 18664.68s]  Tahm Kench?
[18664.68s -> 18669.59s]  I mean, I get it.
[18669.59s -> 18671.59s]  But I think it's bad.
[18671.59s -> 18682.67s]  Runes? Oh shit. Yo, you just saved me looking like an absolute fool. Thank you. Holy crap.
[18682.67s -> 18685.11s]  If you wanted to see my runes, they're here, but thank you, you reminded me. Here, I'm
[18685.11s -> 18728.85s]  gonna be right back. I'm gonna get some water. I'll be right back. Get some agua.
[18728.85s -> 18735.13s]  By the way, the people who are here to watch me play AD Carry, I sincerely apologize.
[18735.13s -> 18743.24s]  I know watching me play Senna is probably boring as fuck, okay?
[18743.24s -> 18744.24s]  I know.
[18744.24s -> 18750.08s]  And I promise you we will play AD carry at some point, I promise you.
[18750.08s -> 18753.36s]  I played like, the first four hours of the stream was AD carry, or the first three,
[18753.36s -> 18754.36s]  right?
[18754.36s -> 18756.46s]  I played on my smurf for a few games and played some AD, so if you want to watch
[18756.46s -> 18758.16s]  that you can go back into the bot.
[18758.16s -> 18761.72s]  We did some commentary and shit.
[18761.72s -> 18765.04s]  The only reason I'm playing so much Senna and support on this account is because
[18765.04s -> 18771.20s]  like there the elo I'm currently in is like the worst elo to climb in solo queue because of
[18772.16s -> 18780.36s]  a lot of factors and support has some of the highest impact on the game whereas like adc has
[18780.36s -> 18785.08s]  high impact late but in in solo queue you want to have high impact early and I wanted
[18785.08s -> 18812.16s]  to be able to uh impact the game really early on so yeah sorry about being you know
[18812.16s -> 18825.84s]  boring and shit i just really want to like win games at least on this account i want to get out
[18825.84s -> 18842.12s]  of the silo because the faster i get out of the silo the the faster um the faster i get out of
[18842.12s -> 18852.04s]  the silo the faster i can have fun playing adc and like trying climb what a weird like what
[18852.04s -> 18860.08s]  a weird play by these guys what the fuck they like half shoved the waves to get like early
[18860.08s -> 18874.03s]  bush control and then I did shit like that. This guy's just dead. I'm gonna give it to Twitch.
[18878.46s -> 18883.50s]  Nice, we got his exhaust. So I wasted my exhaust there. I did it because I thought the Jinx was
[18883.50s -> 18888.62s]  gonna insta-flash. Like I didn't exhaust it because I was like scared of her damage.
[18889.42s -> 18895.26s]  I did it because I thought she was gonna like uh try and flash away the second that uh but
[18895.26s -> 18898.94s]  I-I landed my snare. It was kind of bad by me. I mean I landed my snare so I didn't
[18898.94s -> 18902.16s]  I didn't need to exhaust her, I just was like, oh maybe she'll flash.
[18902.16s -> 18903.16s]  She did not.
[18903.16s -> 18904.16s]  She did not flash.
[18904.16s -> 18906.20s]  What deal is this?
[18906.20s -> 18910.18s]  This is 500 LP Masters, 400 LP.
[18910.18s -> 18913.04s]  It's insane, I know.
[18913.04s -> 18935.51s]  Absolutely crazy.
[18935.51s -> 18939.91s]  Put that ward there because Gragas is probably bot, you know.
[18939.91s -> 18953.28s]  So, mmm, they're trying to come up from bot to kill me here.
[18953.28s -> 18956.88s]  Like their bot lane is rotating up to try and kill me.
[18956.88s -> 18959.38s]  So.
[18959.38s -> 18962.80s]  Just be careful Twitch, they're in here man.
[18962.80s -> 18972.98s]  I actually have to back and walk, look.
[18972.98s -> 18974.12s]  This is hilarious.
[18974.12s -> 18976.20s]  The enemy bot lane is literally just roaming mid.
[18976.20s -> 18977.20s]  Look at this.
[18977.20s -> 18978.20s]  What?
[18978.20s -> 18981.08s]  Why?
[18981.08s -> 18991.13s]  I'm not trying to soak his XP, I just want those souls.
[18991.13s -> 19006.09s]  I'm scared to walk in here, I don't know where Gragas is.
[19006.09s -> 19011.65s]  I gotta come bot to help my Twitch so they don't freeze the wave.
[19011.65s -> 19013.93s]  Like I don't want them to be able to freeze here.
[19013.93s -> 19020.67s]  Even if Gragas ganks, we win the fight right now.
[19020.67s -> 19024.41s]  It's an easy fight win as long as you don't get knocked up. We just win the fight automatically
[19032.28s -> 19035.10s]  Actually, we're trying to bait Gragas to come gank this
[19043.44s -> 19044.72s]  easy
[19044.72s -> 19046.72s]  double flashes baby easy
[19047.86s -> 19053.34s]  You fucking cowards
[19053.40s -> 19066.30s]  We should back up
[19066.30s -> 19069.02s]  Like I can go by now. Oh Gragas is top
[19069.66s -> 19071.66s]  We could actually maybe do dragon
[19071.90s -> 19078.38s]  Yo, I'm gonna be real a soul roaming is not a not in like the top list of me being like nervous about it
[19078.38s -> 19088.68s]  Like I'm not nervous about a soul roaming men push this so we can oh we're diving them
[19089.68s -> 19093.28s]  That's a bit scary. Welcome to the League of Draven
[19094.12s -> 19099.32s]  Good to see you're back to enjoying the game. Whoa, we're going still diving that that's not good
[19100.08s -> 19116.64s]  Like we back off here man. I mean we can maybe go up here if you really want to I kind of work this I
[19123.28s -> 19125.32s]  Need to reset though really badly right now
[19126.20s -> 19132.13s]  like really badly
[19133.13s -> 19135.49s]  Not being on the map here is really bad
[19136.89s -> 19138.89s]  Or rather not like having
[19139.25s -> 19142.21s]  Gold spent and being on the map is what I'm gonna say like it's really fucking bad
[19143.01s -> 19146.73s]  Yo back up, you know Gragas that you watched him walk past three wards
[19148.01s -> 19150.53s]  That's why I just warded. No. No, he's still here
[19151.41s -> 19153.41s]  Gragas is right there
[19154.33s -> 19158.09s]  We know Gragas is somewhere bot lane right now, I don't know where but we know he's there
[19158.65s -> 19165.87s]  They're on dragon. Okay
[19165.87s -> 19167.87s]  We can fight this go go go
[19168.27s -> 19186.59s]  W over I'm here. Nice. Yo, come here
[19188.07s -> 19191.07s]  Yeah, I'll help you come get this come get it the mother's blue I
[19192.87s -> 19228.20s]  Got you baby. What the fuck made a bitch. Oh, yes, I'll back
[19230.06s -> 19232.92s]  Yo Spartan, thank you for the six months man, welcome back
[19233.86s -> 19235.86s]  Appreciate it
[19235.90s -> 19238.62s]  Yes, we'll back. We'll get our fucking umbral
[19239.58s -> 19245.02s]  I'm gonna go topside of the map now and I'm gonna help my team get Rift Heralds.
[19245.02s -> 19256.40s]  I'm gonna ping, I wanna go topside, I wanna help my team get Rifts.
[19256.40s -> 19260.12s]  The wave, if we look at bot wave, it's pushing into us, it's totally fine.
[19260.12s -> 19261.12s]  Okay?
[19261.12s -> 19264.04s]  Twitch is level 6.
[19264.04s -> 19274.01s]  The bot wave's pushing in, we are totally fine to do what I'm doing right now.
[19274.01s -> 19286.07s]  He doesn't know I'm here.
[19286.07s -> 19293.99s]  I'm dead though.
[19293.99s -> 19297.19s]  Bro.
[19297.19s -> 19300.75s]  No joke, I almost juked that.
[19300.75s -> 19302.01s]  That's so close.
[19302.01s -> 19313.43s]  I was hoping like Wukong for some reason didn't walk topside, but the enemy botlane did?
[19313.43s -> 19315.65s]  Okay the enemy botlane just griefed their entire game.
[19315.65s -> 19317.41s]  The game's over, we win.
[19317.41s -> 19318.85s]  What the fuck are they doing?
[19318.85s -> 19322.41s]  What is happening?
[19322.41s -> 19324.73s]  Like my Twitch is just getting free plates.
[19324.73s -> 19340.14s]  Wait, you guys are griefing.
[19340.14s -> 19341.66s]  I'm griefing.
[19341.66s -> 19344.38s]  Dude, what the fuck?
[19344.38s -> 19353.06s]  Why would you fight them? Guys, guys, guys, Wukong. Wukong. Okay, we see that our Twitch
[19353.06s -> 19358.18s]  is getting free plates bought, free first turret. Okay, I'm backed. I almost soloed
[19358.18s -> 19365.10s]  their AD carry, okay? Or their jungler. Why would you ever, on purpose, take a
[19365.10s -> 19373.12s]  fight like that with no... Oh, I have cancer. Also, the Wukong's an idiot. He
[19373.12s -> 19378.52s]  He doesn't understand macro at all apparently because I literally pinged to come to rift.
[19378.52s -> 19383.50s]  My Wukong was like nervous.
[19383.50s -> 19385.50s]  Like for some reason Wukong didn't walk top.
[19385.50s -> 19387.60s]  He sat bot trying to gank.
[19387.60s -> 19390.12s]  But the objective was rift not...
[19390.12s -> 19394.10s]  God I'm losing my mind in this elo.
[19394.10s -> 19399.18s]  Masters players are literally just diamond players with slightly better mechanics.
[19399.18s -> 19402.04s]  They don't know anything about the game and I'm about to, my brain's about to
[19402.04s -> 19405.60s]  explode like a peanut.
[19405.60s -> 19410.68s]  It's not about them laning 2v2, you fucking kumquat.
[19410.68s -> 19412.82s]  Dude I know they can't lane against us 2v2.
[19412.82s -> 19414.56s]  It's not about the 2v2, man.
[19414.56s -> 19418.56s]  We get a free rift herald because we shut down their bot lane and I'm on an item
[19418.56s -> 19419.56s]  spike.
[19419.56s -> 19421.32s]  So we just automatically get a free rift.
[19421.32s -> 19427.01s]  It has nothing to do with 2v2.
[19427.01s -> 19433.89s]  This kumquat motherfucker.
[19433.89s -> 19435.93s]  I don't know why that's my insult.
[19435.93s -> 19439.65s]  The pedestrian guy got to me.
[19439.65s -> 19440.65s]  Somehow.
[19440.65s -> 19449.34s]  Where the fuck is this ward?
[19449.34s -> 19460.94s]  Oh because I'm telling you right now my macro there was a hundred percent correct by the way like 1000 percent
[19471.11s -> 19475.49s]  Like even though I died. I know it was correct. No, no just do dragon. Do not dive
[19476.43s -> 19479.83s]  Guys, we don't have to not everything's about kills not everything's about kills. We got this
[19481.03s -> 19485.03s]  Like you don't need to dive you don't need to dive always you don't need to see a kill be like, oh monkey
[19485.03s -> 19492.31s]  Kill brain go like the game is about like getting objectives on timers and playing off of tempo and things like that
[19492.31s -> 19498.27s]  Like the only reason we even lost rift was because my Wukong went full monkey brain and was like no
[19498.27s -> 19501.99s]  We need to not play for this rift with a giant massive lead
[19522.26s -> 19524.10s]  Wait kill this guy
[19524.10s -> 19530.29s]  What am I watching right now?
[19531.81s -> 19538.79s]  This is outrageous my Wukong just solo ulted there dude, I'm gonna lose it my Wukong just solo ulted there Gragas
[19539.37s -> 19551.38s]  on a good note though
[19551.88s -> 19554.74s]  They don't get any plates off of rifting so it's not that bad
[19556.50s -> 19562.39s]  Okay, man, just push like dude hit the minions like stop my bad
[19563.71s -> 19567.47s]  Sorry, I'm wound up right now. Kennen. Okay, I'm a little wound
[19568.51s -> 19570.51s]  Apologies if I if I griefed you man
[19572.19s -> 19574.19s]  It's fine
[19574.39s -> 19576.39s]  So the wound up it's fine. I
[19576.91s -> 19582.75s]  Just don't like when like stuff like that happens. I'm a perfectionist and it's my big place. I thought about this earlier
[19582.75s -> 19585.99s]  I'm a perfectionist. My biggest flaw is that like I will
[19587.19s -> 19594.81s]  Play the game 100% correctly on like tempo and timers, but you can't do that because you got to remember to like your teammates are teammates
[19598.36s -> 19601.94s]  Like they're not just gonna instantly know exactly what you're what what to do
[19603.08s -> 19616.79s]  We win that guy don't just stand here and watch me die man
[19617.91s -> 19619.91s]  Holy shit
[19623.45s -> 19628.09s]  That is oh my god, if he if he had let me die there I might have screamed
[19629.29s -> 19631.73s]  Actually screamed out loud in anger
[19632.39s -> 19640.43s]  Like, dude is watching me kite these people within one inch of my life, and instead of
[19640.43s -> 19645.59s]  like helping or walking up and doing anything, you know what he does?
[19645.59s -> 19650.89s]  He pulls a fucking gross score.
[19650.89s -> 19652.13s]  My man just likes to watch.
[19652.13s -> 19672.10s]  There's nothing wrong with it, but, you know, there's a time and a place.
[19672.10s -> 19674.46s]  I don't actually want to buy pinks, because I don't think we're strong enough that,
[19674.46s -> 19678.02s]  uh, I don't think that we're strong enough that I can actually even defend the pinks
[19678.02s -> 19681.66s]  right now, if I'm being honest, like, we should be strong enough, but we kind of
[19681.66s -> 19684.86s]  through our lead when I over forced the rift.
[19684.86s -> 19697.66s]  So I think, I think we need to push this wave
[19697.94s -> 19701.02s]  so that we can get tempo and move around the map.
[19701.02s -> 19709.42s]  Pryo, sorry, I keep saying the wrong thing.
[19709.42s -> 19710.98s]  Uh oh, that guy's dead.
[19710.98s -> 19712.54s]  I have to ditch that guy.
[19713.70s -> 19714.54s]  He's dead as fuck.
[19714.54s -> 19716.46s]  Oh, I'm dead too maybe.
[19716.46s -> 19717.46s]  Oh, I am so dead.
[19718.66s -> 19720.58s]  Yeah, that was my bad.
[19720.58s -> 19722.30s]  That was my bad, my bad, my bad.
[19722.30s -> 19724.38s]  Like we just got, we just got ran down.
[19724.38s -> 19728.04s]  That was on me.
[19728.04s -> 19730.28s]  Like we had good positioning,
[19730.28s -> 19733.52s]  but the jungler wasn't close enough.
[19733.52s -> 19736.90s]  So this is my bad.
[19736.90s -> 19738.96s]  I also didn't expect to get fucking four mans,
[19738.96s -> 19743.31s]  but I should have, right?
[19743.31s -> 19745.27s]  We should play for this though.
[19745.27s -> 19746.11s]  I wish I could type.
[19746.11s -> 19748.11s]  I wish I wasn't chat restricted for a year.
[19749.51s -> 19752.91s]  Dude, I swear to God, I'm not even being mean.
[19752.91s -> 19754.91s]  Like Riot was like, they chat restricted me
[19754.91s -> 19757.31s]  because I type so much macro
[19757.31s -> 19758.63s]  that it gets on people's nerves
[19758.63s -> 19765.29s]  and they don't want to be spam typing.
[19765.29s -> 19766.61s]  Low key.
[19766.61s -> 19779.05s]  Don't play for rifts.
[19779.05s -> 19781.05s]  I need help, guys, if you guys can help.
[19782.29s -> 19794.93s]  We need to clear vision on dragon.
[19794.93s -> 19795.77s]  A year?
[19795.77s -> 19798.79s]  Yeah, I get unchat restricted April 15th
[19798.79s -> 19802.75s]  or April 11th or some shit, 2024.
[19804.59s -> 19805.93s]  I've never seen it.
[19805.93s -> 19808.95s]  It must've been like an actual rioter or something.
[19808.95s -> 19810.61s]  Like I've never seen an automated system
[19810.61s -> 19812.81s]  give you a year chat restricts, right?
[19812.81s -> 19815.37s]  So in my mind, it's got to be like an actual, like,
[19817.88s -> 19819.52s]  like a rioter was like Geronimo.
[19820.92s -> 19823.48s]  We know you're good enough to climb, but stop typing.
[19825.12s -> 19825.96s]  You know what I mean?
[19825.96s -> 19833.45s]  That's like what must have been going on.
[19833.45s -> 19836.15s]  And I'm like, okay, well, sure.
[19852.14s -> 19854.78s]  I mean, I didn't even know you could get chat banned a year.
[19854.78s -> 19856.12s]  What's weird is like, like I said,
[19856.12s -> 19857.42s]  I don't like say trigger words.
[19857.42s -> 19859.26s]  It's not like I tell people to like end themselves
[19859.26s -> 19860.34s]  and stuff.
[19860.34s -> 19863.30s]  It's mainly just me typing like, go here, do that,
[19863.30s -> 19869.06s]  Do this like I type a lot, right? Which is obviously like if you type a lot it can be toxic as well. So
[19873.08s -> 19875.08s]  Like typing a lot's annoying so I get it
[19886.47s -> 19889.43s]  We should be playing for baron side vision right now not
[19890.79s -> 19893.43s]  The vision we're playing with right now is bad. We should be playing over here
[19895.43s -> 19899.27s]  Like I want to play for baron vision, but it's a little hard to do that right now
[19904.58s -> 19907.94s]  Because you see how tom kench and me are like transferring vision control around the map right now
[19908.66s -> 19910.74s]  we're playing this little support game of like
[19911.06s -> 19916.76s]  Hide the vision look at this fuck look at this motherfucker. Oh
[19931.40s -> 19933.40s]  He's so dumb I
[19941.68s -> 19943.44s]  Still think he's dumb
[19943.44s -> 19953.67s]  How did I just take him?
[19953.83s -> 19960.53s]  tonight I
[19960.57s -> 19962.57s]  Took my entire HP bar on a global
[19963.01s -> 19968.66s]  My bad, dude. I really wish the malphite would group though. I
[19968.66s -> 19969.82s]  I
[19969.82s -> 19975.98s]  Get that he's like doing the thing where he's like, oh, let's you know, split like his play was actually really smart there
[19976.58s -> 19980.62s]  The Malphite's play I mean like that wasn't his fault that we got shit on at all
[19980.62s -> 19985.48s]  I just wish that he would group because if he groups up and hits our we win every team fight
[19986.30s -> 19991.26s]  Because right now our only frontliner is the Wukong right and the fact that Wukong's our frontliner
[19991.26s -> 19993.26s]  We don't have the ability to play the game
[19994.74s -> 19996.70s]  When I get stuck on that what the fuck was that
[19996.70s -> 20004.82s]  Like that Tom Kinch getting to E forward like that blindly into our entire team and then not getting punished for it
[20004.82s -> 20007.24s]  Might be the most like solo queue thing I've ever seen
[20007.82s -> 20010.72s]  nobody wanted to hit him because he was the tank, but
[20012.42s -> 20015.00s]  Yeah, that's we should still kill him, you know
[20020.79s -> 20024.41s]  We can fight this guy. Oh my god jungler. Just come. Oh
[20025.63s -> 20028.13s]  We're forfeiting. Okay. Now that makes perfect sense, right?
[20028.13s -> 20036.81s]  it. Just come group. Bro, Kennen, come group. Please guys. Like, I don't know why everybody's
[20036.81s -> 20043.53s]  frustrated. We're literally still up in gold. Please come group up. We just took an inhibitor.
[20043.53s -> 20050.41s]  Just come group. Help me get vision on this dragon so we don't die. Like, I need
[20050.41s -> 20056.28s]  my team to actually walk over here to help me get vision. It's really frustrating
[20056.28s -> 20060.20s]  because I need the frontliners, the Wukong and the Malphite to walk in with me.
[20060.20s -> 20065.08s]  Because I'm a little fucking, well I have a big gun, but I'm a big gun girl, right?
[20065.08s -> 20074.84s]  So I need these two guys to walk in with me, these two big burly mountain men, so
[20074.84s -> 20076.48s]  that I can play the game, you know?
[20076.48s -> 20077.84s]  No, we don't push bot.
[20077.84s -> 20081.36s]  No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[20081.36s -> 20083.80s]  no bot is worthless, come mid.
[20083.80s -> 20086.56s]  My Malphite's pushing the wave that we already have down.
[20086.56s -> 20088.66s]  I wish I could macro.
[20088.66s -> 20090.24s]  I wish I could type some macro right now.
[20090.24s -> 20096.90s]  They're like my team is so lost. They're so beyond lost right now. It's crazy
[20098.89s -> 20108.68s]  They're lost as shit
[20108.68s -> 20112.24s]  Just do dragon guys. Just do this. Just do it. I'll start it for you. Here you go.
[20113.00s -> 20116.80s]  I don't know why we're standing in a bush waiting for them to face check. Do dragon guys
[20117.40s -> 20126.20s]  I swear to God you have to do everything in this elo where you have to start every fight
[20126.20s -> 20128.66s]  I have to basically I have to start every fight
[20129.20s -> 20133.44s]  Right, I have to not only start every fight, but I have to like ping my team what to do exactly
[20133.44s -> 20139.68s]  Exactly because everybody plays so safe in this elo. Why did my malphite just stop his back?
[20141.76s -> 20153.73s]  Why are you all fighting? Oh my god, please guys, it's fine. It's fine
[20155.33s -> 20157.33s]  No malphite you can't 1v9 that
[20157.57s -> 20162.61s]  Just back off. They didn't get anything. They didn't get anything. We got dragon. We're on dragon soul points
[20164.77s -> 20169.49s]  I'm losing hairs. I'm losing fucking hairs man. I ain't got many hairs to spare anymore
[20169.97s -> 20180.62s]  We're out here losing hair. It's like I'm babysitting like this has got to be what a preschool teacher feels like, you know
[20181.26s -> 20185.96s]  Like low-key like preschool teacher just feels feels like this. This has to be it
[20191.20s -> 20197.26s]  like watching it's like watching a toddler like you watch them from the corner right and they're like eating glue and you're like I
[20197.80s -> 20202.22s]  Mean that's bad. And then you tell him like don't eat blue. Don't eat blue Timmy and he's like, okay
[20202.22s -> 20207.16s]  And then like you leave him there for five minutes to go like do something to watch somebody else then all of a sudden
[20207.16s -> 20209.16s]  Timmy's eating glue again and you're like, bro
[20209.96s -> 20223.27s]  Bro, we just had this discussion and it's like not Timmy's fault right because he's a toddler
[20224.41s -> 20230.47s]  So you can't be mad at Timmy because he's a toddler you can't but it's like it's frustrating. It's like god damn it, man
[20241.94s -> 20247.36s]  Like what is what is happening? Like Malphite just group. My Malphite has a fetish with just pushing bot
[20248.22s -> 20250.22s]  Bro, just group and hit R
[20251.28s -> 20255.46s]  Bro, I know you have Bork. Wait, you have Bork?
[20255.46s -> 20262.62s]  Wait, I- Bro, we need- we need to be able to engage.
[20262.62s -> 20264.88s]  We don't win through split.
[20264.88s -> 20266.96s]  Just group up, hit R, and we win.
[20266.96s -> 20271.46s]  Like, I've been controlling the everliving fuck out of all the vision this game.
[20271.46s -> 20275.10s]  I feel like I'm doing all of this to control vision and shit, and it still feels
[20275.10s -> 20276.98s]  like it's not enough.
[20276.98s -> 20277.98s]  It's kinda nuts.
[20277.98s -> 20283.85s]  Lowkey, it still feels not enough.
[20283.85s -> 20292.67s]  No, don't go bot, don't go bot, don't go bot, don't go bot, please don't go
[20292.67s -> 20293.67s]  bot.
[20293.67s -> 20294.67s]  Hit me!
[20294.67s -> 20295.67s]  Hit me!
[20295.67s -> 20305.41s]  They don't have a ward.
[20305.41s -> 20306.41s]  They don't know I'm there.
[20306.41s -> 20315.44s]  What?
[20315.44s -> 20322.38s]  We're just not gonna ult that guy or what?
[20322.38s -> 20325.14s]  This is why we listen.
[20325.14s -> 20331.16s]  Oh my god, I have, I actually just, I'm so, I don't know what to say.
[20331.16s -> 20333.00s]  Like I literally pinged to come.
[20333.00s -> 20335.02s]  Wukong didn't use ulti.
[20335.02s -> 20337.38s]  Twitch just died in, and now he's afk.
[20337.38s -> 20338.38s]  Oh my god.
[20338.38s -> 20340.16s]  Oh my god, kill me in game.
[20340.16s -> 20341.96s]  Kennen and Malphite, can you guys do anything?
[20341.96s -> 20354.03s]  Like bro, can we, can we like, just go in Kennen, just ulti.

[20407.10s -> 20409.10s]  Bro, we do not need the malphite
[20410.30s -> 20412.30s]  I am a higher level than my jungler
[20416.60s -> 20418.76s]  Push mid guys. You gotta push mid first
[20419.64s -> 20421.64s]  Listen homies. You gotta push mid first
[20421.64s -> 20429.67s]  You know what, fuck it, don't even go in, yeah, fuck it, push mid.
[20429.67s -> 20430.67s]  We're just gonna end the game.
[20430.67s -> 20439.03s]  If they go for dragon here, we just push, fuck it.
[20439.03s -> 20454.54s]  That's actually such a good macro call, not even joking.
[20454.54s -> 20461.88s]  Such a good macro call, actually.
[20461.88s -> 20464.88s]  Everybody just run though, just run.
[20464.88s -> 20467.56s]  Don't ulti in, no, guys, we don't fight this.
[20467.56s -> 20470.36s]  Oh, I have cancer.
[20470.36s -> 20472.36s]  We're getting flanked, boys.
[20472.36s -> 20475.88s]  Dude, I have such high levels of cancer right now. You have no idea
[20476.80s -> 20479.38s]  Like high high fucking functioning cancer
[20480.28s -> 20520.07s]  And you guys just kill the fucking Gragas. Oh my god. Thank god. Thank god. Just end the game
[20520.99s -> 20524.51s]  Please end the game. Please hit the fucking thing. Oh, oh
[20525.99s -> 20529.91s]  My god, Walter White is like my hero right now
[20529.91s -> 20536.63s]  I don't even understand like I feel like every like I feel like what Walter White felt like dealing with Skylar
[20536.67s -> 20541.83s]  for literally three years like this is outrageous this is what this feels like
[20541.83s -> 20579.04s]  like I I can relate to the show so much more oh my god like dude oh crap dude
[20579.04s -> 20582.66s]  look at just look at the like look at like what's going on in the game
[20582.66s -> 20593.02s]  like I I don't even mean to be mean about this it's just this is this is
[20593.02s -> 20610.39s]  crazy malphite though popping off malphite popping off like what do you
[20610.39s -> 20621.06s]  know is this guy oh he's literally diamond why is this guy in this game I
[20621.06s -> 20625.44s]  mean I feel I feel like confused now I'm not even blaming the wukong anymore
[20625.44s -> 20635.23s]  I don't know why this guy is in the game oh he has inflated ass MMR oh he
[20635.23s -> 20640.15s]  just has previous season inflated MMR that's what this is cuz he was GM
[20640.15s -> 20645.13s]  for three years so the his MMR says that he like belongs here even though he
[20645.13s -> 20651.14s]  doesn't play like I bet you last season he only played like 50 games I can look
[20651.14s -> 20654.74s]  right you see like how many games he played yeah he played he played like
[20654.74s -> 20658.58s]  50 games last season so like his MMR didn't really change he just got
[20658.58s -> 20662.34s]  masters and then stopped which is fine there's nothing wrong with that
[20662.34s -> 20676.52s]  I just wish he would chill you know like not rage quit halfway through
[20676.52s -> 20682.69s]  the game because like I said people's elo and shit used to bother me a lot I
[20682.69s -> 20685.79s]  don't I don't get bothered by it anymore because I realized it was cringe I don't
[20685.79s -> 20688.55s]  care about their elo and shit what I care about is like I just want them to
[20688.55s -> 20691.67s]  play the game you know what I mean like I just want them to not rage not
[20691.67s -> 20694.71s]  not like be absolute apes in the game and just play that's all I ask
[20694.71s -> 20697.55s]  for I don't care if you're a diamond player or a plat player in the game
[20697.55s -> 20700.81s]  and you're just like accidentally in the game like it's not your fault I just want you to push
[20700.81s -> 20712.22s]  buttons what I'm doing wrong to have a 36% win rate I can't see the link
[20712.22s -> 20714.46s]  Cuz just you'd have to give me your name and your server
[20714.94s -> 20721.79s]  How are you guys doing by the way everybody having a good day? You guys enjoying the stream having a good time?
[20722.71s -> 20728.79s]  Watching me go bald in live like live time you guys are like oh look Geronimo is going bald live on stream
[20730.91s -> 20733.67s]  It's rough, well, I'm gonna take my pants off
[20771.48s -> 20775.43s]  Dude what I
[20775.43s -> 20777.43s]  Fuck you guys
[20777.43s -> 20783.51s]  They fucking like I get double swapped. Did you guys see that shit? Oh, yeah, the support could do it and then he banned Senna. I
[20784.55s -> 20786.55s]  Mean, I didn't hover it. So that's my bad
[20787.35s -> 20795.42s]  God damn it. I should have hovered. I was just like taking my pants off and now he wants first pick
[20796.02s -> 20803.91s]  Dude, what? Oh my god. I don't I don't know. I don't know what to say. This is crazy
[20808.85s -> 20810.85s]  Today's Thursday, right?
[20811.53s -> 20824.06s]  Am I losing days today's Thursday, right guys it is okay cool
[20825.00s -> 20832.60s]  What do I play? They have Xerath and Zin. They have Xayah. I guess I can just play Rakan.
[20832.60s -> 20842.95s]  It's not a big deal. Let's see what their bot lane is though. I actually have to see
[20842.95s -> 20853.66s]  what their bot lane is to choose my runes. Sona? No. Oh they have an Ezreal? What
[20853.66s -> 20881.69s]  the fuck is their team comp? Um, okay. When you do this build, what's the secondary
[20881.69s -> 20889.41s]  supposed to be? I think it's supposed to be this. Or maybe like Revitalize? I
[20889.41s -> 20892.25s]  I just like unflinching so good. Oh
[20894.82s -> 20896.82s]  They have a support
[20897.18s -> 20900.14s]  Zerath so supports out. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so I want I
[20901.10s -> 20903.28s]  definitely want glacial here and I want
[20905.22s -> 20909.38s]  Maybe I take a more actually instead of armor because they have two poke champs
[20910.62s -> 20920.22s]  And I take this. Yeah. Yeah, this is good. Okay, that's not bad. Okay, what's that? I'll be right here. It's more water
[20977.46s -> 20989.23s]  Oh shit, no, don't flag me.
[20989.23s -> 20993.23s]  Fuck man, I had to pee.
[20993.23s -> 20996.19s]  Don't fucking flag me for AFK because I didn't take a leak.
[20996.19s -> 21000.16s]  Can you not start with AD carry then move over to support?
[21000.16s -> 21003.68s]  I always fall asleep before the AD carry gameplay.
[21003.68s -> 21004.68s]  Wait what?
[21004.68s -> 21006.44s]  I always fall asleep before AD carry?
[21006.44s -> 21008.80s]  What do you mean?
[21008.80s -> 21011.30s]  Oh, you mean like start with my main and then play
[21013.88s -> 21027.79s]  Yeah, I played ad carry at the start I should probably
[21029.47s -> 21031.81s]  Play ad carry more over support
[21033.83s -> 21035.49s]  Later in the stream
[21035.49s -> 21038.95s]  Here I'll play an ad carry game after this. I feel bad. Oh
[21056.92s -> 21060.00s]  It's Gragas. I thought it was gonna be Zerath, but it's Gragas. I
[21063.81s -> 21067.81s]  Don't want to fight too hard level one, even though that guy I should have gone in there
[21067.89s -> 21072.71s]  That's my bad. I want to I want to try and get level two here. Even though I think we actually win level one
[21073.67s -> 21079.48s]  Well, I got his bone plating. Yeah, I should have fought level one. That was my bad
[21080.52s -> 21083.04s]  Cuz we went very hard level one. I just griefed it
[21084.28s -> 21088.64s]  Like all I have to do there is go in on the Ezreal or the Gragas level one and they can't play the game
[21090.16s -> 21108.52s]  Right, it's not worth it's not worth
[21110.00s -> 21113.20s]  There's no way that I can not get E'd by Gragas there by the way
[21113.20s -> 21129.58s]  Like, I don't know if I can flash W there.
[21129.58s -> 21131.50s]  Maybe we shouldn't be egoing, buddy.
[21131.50s -> 21139.90s]  This guy just fucking egos in front of me, like what?
[21139.90s -> 21172.02s]  Okay, I might have missed everything there, but like, you know, it's okay.
[21172.02s -> 21177.94s]  It's a little counterproductive when I take a tower shot to land a Q.
[21177.94s -> 21189.33s]  It feels a little counterproductive.
[21189.33s -> 21190.45s]  Hey
[21190.45s -> 21195.94s]  I'm gonna back here just in case
[21196.74s -> 21199.14s]  The enemy Zin tries to gank mid
[21201.73s -> 21203.85s]  Dude, I'm so sad. I can't get boots
[21204.65s -> 21210.63s]  I'm gonna wait
[21210.63s -> 21212.63s]  Yeah, I'm gonna be cringe. I'm gonna wait. I
[21213.15s -> 21217.47s]  Would never wait here normally, but you know what? It's just it's so like it's such a big bye. I
[21218.99s -> 21220.99s]  Don't want to I'm
[21221.47s -> 21226.15s]  Now that now that I've waited and beat cringe now, I have to sit here and wait. Oh, it's so painful
[21226.63s -> 21228.39s]  Okay, I'm on my way
[21228.39s -> 21247.39s]  I'm sorry guys
[21247.39s -> 21254.06s]  Worth the wait. Nah, not at all. I got lucky but
[21254.88s -> 21269.69s]  You know, what's interesting? I never use the stupid de-materializer
[21269.69s -> 21274.57s]  I think I should have like I should use it on every cannon or some shit, but I just don't do it
[21275.13s -> 21278.09s]  Because I know the reason you're supposed to use it is because it helps you push
[21278.81s -> 21281.59s]  Because you can de-materialize the cannon right and just instead. Yeah
[21282.37s -> 21285.73s]  so you're supposed to use it because it's like a really fast way to push but it's also a I
[21285.73s -> 21309.40s]  I should not have W'd fuck. I won't not the Gragas anyway. I fucked up. I shouldn't have W'd the Gragas
[21309.40s -> 21312.69s]  I should have played it slower
[21312.69s -> 21314.69s]  This guy's gonna die. Oh
[21317.29s -> 21319.37s]  He's gonna die he put himself against the wall GG
[21321.61s -> 21323.49s]  That was my fault though
[21323.49s -> 21327.92s]  100%
[21327.92s -> 21332.70s]  Cuz if I didn't W in they can't kill us, right and Gragas probably dies to the auto attack
[21332.70s -> 21335.50s]  Anyway, my thought process was Gragas is snared
[21335.50s -> 21340.94s]  So if I W here, but even after like even if I don't get E'd, I'm pretty confident I'd die
[21377.49s -> 21388.08s]  Damn it. I tried I was out of everything. I wonder if I could have played that better
[21388.80s -> 21391.44s]  Maybe like if I could have weaved an extra auto in or something
[21392.72s -> 21394.72s]  I don't know
[21394.88s -> 21412.34s]  It's hard to know
[21412.34s -> 21414.34s]  All right. I'm gonna go mid here
[21415.22s -> 21418.86s]  Oh, I can't okay
[21418.86s -> 21422.30s]  Well, I could go mid, but I think I I think I want to sit bot for a bit and get some xp
[21424.74s -> 21426.74s]  I think it's smarter to do that at this point
[21427.30s -> 21450.14s]  I think we should push this. I don't want to W in because I know Zin's here. Yeah
[21450.90s -> 21470.85s]  Huh? That's why I didn't want to W because I know Zin's here. They were just making it so obvious right like that
[21470.85s -> 21472.85s]  It was like
[21472.85s -> 21476.97s]  Sometimes when people make shit too good to be true. It is too good to be true
[21478.53s -> 21481.65s]  Like oh shit, we're just gonna they're just gonna fight us here cool. Oh
[21483.37s -> 21489.68s]  Yeah, I gotta help him push my bad I'm playing sloppy
[21489.68s -> 21521.59s]  You guys wanna see a cool trick? Watch this.
[21521.59s -> 21525.77s]  She could push the wave and then just min max the back.
[21525.77s -> 21530.74s]  How cool was that?
[21530.74s -> 21533.06s]  She just pushes the wave and I just back next to the bush and she's just like
[21533.06s -> 21548.15s]  oh I guess I'll take the free ride.
[21548.15s -> 21550.23s]  I really need level 6.
[21550.23s -> 21562.34s]  Badly.
[21562.34s -> 21565.70s]  Like bro, I really cannot get level 6 right now.
[21565.70s -> 21567.70s]  This is painful.
[21567.70s -> 21574.37s]  Hey, kill these?
[21574.37s -> 21575.37s]  Maybe I'm 6 off this?
[21575.37s -> 21577.35s]  Nope, guess not.
[21577.35s -> 21580.65s]  I was gonna stay mid there, by the way, and help the homie.
[21581.95s -> 21582.85s]  I need to go mid.
[21612.85s -> 21628.13s]  This is so awkward.
[21628.13s -> 21636.00s]  Bro, help me.
[21636.00s -> 21638.40s]  Bro, like, you gotta walk to me.
[21638.40s -> 21641.90s]  Like, I can't, like, my Eve is like here.
[21641.90s -> 21645.10s]  I'm way over here, right?
[21645.10s -> 21649.95s]  And my Eve's like, yo, homie.
[21649.95s -> 21650.99s]  Like, dude, I'm, like,
[21650.99s -> 21653.09s]  we're trying to push the wave in for her,
[21653.09s -> 21659.59s]  and she's just not accepting to wait.
[21659.59s -> 21660.95s]  And I can't W the wall.
[21660.95s -> 21662.95s]  I mean, I guess I could W the wall
[21662.95s -> 21664.35s]  because I was trying to walk around, right?
[21664.35s -> 21665.99s]  I saw her in trouble when I was here.
[21665.99s -> 21667.63s]  So I wanted her to walk towards here
[21667.63s -> 21669.87s]  so I could E over the wall.
[21669.87s -> 21671.03s]  That was my thought process.
[21671.03s -> 21673.05s]  E over the wall, help the guy.
[21673.05s -> 21674.91s]  But he like didn't understand that
[21674.91s -> 21682.13s]  and I just got shit on and it felt really bad.
[21682.13s -> 21686.59s]  Both our solos are getting absolutely shit on.
[21686.59s -> 21687.73s]  This is very bad.
[21688.71s -> 21695.34s]  Because I don't know how to help our team at this stage.
[21695.34s -> 21699.26s]  Like I'm just always behind on tempo now around the map in the wrong spot at the wrong time
[21700.30s -> 21726.10s]  This is so awkward
[21726.10s -> 21732.10s]  I have ult we could kill this guy
[21732.26s -> 21734.26s]  I guess not
[21736.18s -> 21756.95s]  We could maybe kill the zhin if I sneak in here push the wave push the wave hurry
[21758.63s -> 21775.66s]  He's gotta crash it
[21775.66s -> 21780.76s]  I mean this guy's just dead
[21781.00s -> 21784.04s]  My 80 carry is gonna get fucked for it though. So I hope it was worth
[21785.08s -> 21787.08s]  Like my 80 carries gonna get zoned
[21793.34s -> 21797.22s]  it's really hard to tell if anything like that's worth sometimes because I
[21798.70s -> 21802.78s]  Used my ult before a dragon fight. We're gonna lose bot tower. There's just so many factors, right?
[21802.78s -> 21806.70s]  It's so hard and now I don't have words. It's so rough. I
[21825.74s -> 21828.38s]  Got the ignite off. But dude, I can't believe that Gragas lived
[21829.06s -> 21836.66s]  No, oh I had stopwatch. I have stopwatch. Oh my god. I'm the worst player in existence. I
[21837.44s -> 21839.82s]  Actually have the ability to live there. Oh
[21839.82s -> 21847.81s]  Oh no, I should sell my magi's in shame. I
[21849.09s -> 21851.09s]  Actually just want the item. So
[21852.69s -> 21854.69s]  Dude I'm so bad
[21855.41s -> 21859.77s]  Dude, Ragus is low-key a good pick versus Rakan though. You can stop his engage so easily
[21868.64s -> 21870.64s]  It's actually low-key a good pick
[21896.45s -> 21921.83s]  bro
[21921.83s -> 21939.28s]  Nice, not bad. I kind of want to back off here. You don't feel it's kind of bad
[21939.28s -> 21945.84s]  You guys notice that I just I got my uh, I don't know if you guys notice this but I got my fucking I
[21948.89s -> 21956.81s]  Got like four assists just now, but it was after I sold my magi's how fucking bad does that feel?
[21957.97s -> 21959.21s]  like
[21959.21s -> 21966.36s]  Actually, oh by the way, uh, I wanted to ask you guys
[21968.44s -> 21971.00s]  What ad carry do you guys think is the most
[21971.76s -> 21973.94s]  Sought out for people to learn right now
[21974.48s -> 21981.55s]  Like what what would you say is like people want to learn this ad carry over other ad carries?
[21982.15s -> 21984.15s]  What are you thinking?
[21984.33s -> 21986.33s]  My man says Teemo, okay
[21986.57s -> 21988.49s]  makes sense
[21988.49s -> 21997.64s]  Got it
[21997.64s -> 22000.36s]  Depends. Yeah, I'm just trying to wonder like what um
[22002.12s -> 22006.16s]  People would want to watch or what people would want to learn specifically
[22006.40s -> 22009.84s]  So I know everybody plays different shit, but I know there's also like popular shit, you know
[22010.40s -> 22016.60s]  Okay, I'm just bad
[22017.48s -> 22020.18s]  He's bad too. Listen, we're we're bad
[22021.24s -> 22068.93s]  We're bad guys
[22068.93s -> 22071.99s]  Not bad
[22071.99s -> 22073.99s]  Jin Lucian Xayah Felios
[22074.23s -> 22077.99s]  Damn, is it like just that different like a lot of people like different stuff?
[22079.86s -> 22082.74s]  because I've always just thought like oh no, I
[22090.36s -> 22093.00s]  guess I've always just thought that people like a
[22095.79s -> 22099.67s]  Lot of people really like like meta ad carries or like really play makey ad carries, right?
[22099.67s -> 22106.19s]  Like Jinx is probably the best AD carry in the meta, but I don't see a lot of people ever ask or like request to watch
[22106.23s -> 22107.19s]  Jinx
[22107.19s -> 22111.59s]  You know what I mean like Jinx is not like she's not like a fun AD carry that people want to learn how to play
[22111.79s -> 22113.79s]  Even though she is like the best AD
[22114.03s -> 22118.03s]  There's like the people who are like oh yeah Jinx is boring like I want to play Jhin and like shoot people
[22118.03s -> 22121.95s]  I want to play like Lucian and dash around like it's like so that's what I'm wondering is like what the number one
[22122.03s -> 22124.35s]  AD carry is for like people just like enjoy watching
[22125.07s -> 22141.40s]  Not bad though
[22141.40s -> 22143.96s]  Okay, I think we could play an AD carry game. I'm down
[22146.88s -> 22148.88s]  I owe you guys an 80 carry game.
[22149.56s -> 22152.44s]  I owe you that much for watching me play support for two hours.
[22152.44s -> 22154.44s]  Actually, I think it was like two and a half hours.
[22157.01s -> 22159.49s]  Uh, yeah, we played four games of support, so it was like two hours.
[22160.89s -> 22163.05s]  Yeah, I owe you guys for... for that.
[22169.04s -> 22170.24s]  Xayah or Vayne?
[22170.24s -> 22172.60s]  Xayah is fun to watch. I do like Xayah.
[22173.00s -> 22175.00s]  You love Jinx and Cait? Oh, there you go.
[22181.61s -> 22184.01s]  You're playing support top, so you like to watch how 80 carries play it?
[22184.01s -> 22185.01s]  Ah.
[22186.53s -> 22189.49s]  So that you can like better help the homies. Got it, got it.
[22202.16s -> 22207.28s]  We need eight wins I think from this point we are right now. I think it's eight wins to get to grandmaster
[22208.40s -> 22213.44s]  I think oops
[22213.44s -> 22217.28s]  Because we're what 370 something right like three set 360
[22219.40s -> 22221.90s]  No, we just won. We're not 360. We're like 370
[22224.12s -> 22228.84s]  We're 387, okay, so it's not updated but what is this stop
[22232.45s -> 22234.45s]  So we need what seven wins
[22235.09s -> 22237.09s]  Net wins to get to gm
[22237.09s -> 22245.01s]  I think we can hit GM. I'm a little less confident right now about Challenger, but I think we can definitely hit GM.
[22246.11s -> 22248.37s]  Like I think I'll get stuck in GM for a bit.
[22249.33s -> 22253.86s]  Unless...
[22253.86s -> 22255.86s]  Unless...
[22255.98s -> 22259.50s]  The games get higher quality, I'll be stuck in GM for a little bit.
[22264.72s -> 22268.06s]  Because the thing about the games so far is like
[22268.50s -> 22273.94s]  the higher quality the games get, the easier it actually is to carry if like if you're a decent player.
[22274.32s -> 22280.52s]  Because the better your teammates get which means that like if you're at that like you say like a challenger player will have a better
[22280.52s -> 22286.20s]  time a challenger ad carry player carrying in challenger if they get a lead then in diamond if they get a lead if
[22286.56s -> 22291.92s]  if that like I know that sounds weird to say but that's it's it's basically just because like
[22292.04s -> 22294.28s]  when your teammates are better they enable you better and
[22294.80s -> 22299.00s]  ad carry and all those other roles when they're being enabled it's a lot easier to play the game like
[22305.20s -> 22308.34s]  If I were to first pick jinx in challenger MMR
[22308.34s -> 22313.32s]  There's a good chance my teammates would pick stuff that like lets me play Jinx, right?
[22313.56s -> 22317.02s]  Not saying it would happen, but there's like a chance that my teammates would pick something that like
[22317.54s -> 22321.54s]  They would pick like tanks or frontliners or some shit right or like Lulu
[22321.84s -> 22326.58s]  Whereas like if you pickin if you're picking Jinx first pickin like let's say you guys are gold average
[22326.84s -> 22331.10s]  Like your support might just literally pick like first-time Vel'Koz or some shit and you're like well this sucks
[22331.68s -> 22345.93s]  Dude, I swear every time I hear the end of this song
[22346.61s -> 22348.65s]  Does anyone know who forest within is?
[22348.65s -> 22350.65s]  I
[22350.65s -> 22355.39s]  Swear the guy talking at the end of this song sounds exactly like forced within
[22357.01s -> 22359.01s]  No joke listen to this listen to this
[22359.29s -> 22372.17s]  That that guy who was like saying it was DJ what like that guy sounded exactly like I don't know why my brain does
[22372.17s -> 22379.73s]  That homie sounded exactly like forced within I swear to God. It's actually like perfectly like if you told me
[22379.73s -> 22381.73s]  That was him. I would immediately believe you
[22381.73s -> 22395.81s]  This guy wants to join the discord. Oh, I'm I'm nervous about this shit. It is my support though
[22395.95s -> 22398.97s]  so like maybe we could join the discord and
[22401.74s -> 22413.15s]  like work together a bit, but I'm also nervous about joining this court calls of people on
[22414.25s -> 22423.44s]  Stream, oh, I don't know. I don't know if it's worth
[22424.20s -> 22430.28s]  Where would you put Ezreal on the tier list? I think Ezreal's A tier. I think he could be S tier for soloq
[22430.28s -> 22437.98s]  But he's hard. He's really hard. Ezreal is one of the hardest ADs. So I would say he's like A tier right now. If you're really good at Ez
[22438.88s -> 22441.24s]  He is very very very strong
[22442.04s -> 22444.22s]  But he's also incredibly hard to play
[22445.86s -> 22450.72s]  But he also is not weak in the meta, so I'd give him like a strong A
[22452.52s -> 22454.52s]  Like above other A's
[22454.52s -> 22460.40s]  Should you focus on mage supports like Brann Xerath or engage like Blitz Nautilus?
[22460.40s -> 22463.88s]  It depends on your elo and it depends on what you're doing.
[22463.88s -> 22469.42s]  I think engage supports in lower elo are bad.
[22469.42s -> 22474.36s]  Oh, somebody dodged.
[22474.36s -> 22482.15s]  I think engage supports in lower elo are bad personally because I think that you
[22482.15s -> 22486.79s]  can be a really good engage player and it doesn't matter if your team just gets
[22486.79s -> 22491.15s]  caught over and over again or if you like make it engage and your team misplays right
[22491.15s -> 22497.11s]  so it's like if you want to play engage supports do it because they are better than other
[22497.11s -> 22502.01s]  like engage supports are better than mages but I think in solo queue mages are better
[22502.01s -> 22506.03s]  to solo carry so it just depends it depends on your elo and it depends on like what
[22506.03s -> 22509.79s]  you're trying to accomplish right because a lot of the time as a support player it's
[22509.79s -> 22515.31s]  why I play Senna right like I play Senna because I like being able to carry games
[22515.31s -> 22523.09s]  as support. That's why I like Senna. Whereas, like, if you're a, um... Like, if I, like,
[22523.09s -> 22526.59s]  I can play almost every support, right? I can play Nautilus, I can play Blay- I can
[22526.59s -> 22530.53s]  play these supports. But the problem is, is like, I feel bad if, like, I get, like,
[22530.53s -> 22533.91s]  it feels really shitty to get people ahead and then have them completely throw their
[22533.91s -> 22537.35s]  leads over and over again and then tilt and rage and shit. So it feels like dog
[22537.35s -> 22541.93s]  shit. So it's nicer to just, like, give myself the opportunity to carry rather than
[22541.93s -> 22547.24s]  rely 100% on other people, you know?
[22547.24s -> 22549.44s]  But I would say the number one thing is
[22550.48s -> 22552.48s]  play what you think is fun.
[22552.48s -> 22553.60s]  That's just the number one rule.
[22553.60s -> 22557.00s]  Like playing, if you wanna win, you can play meta,
[22557.00s -> 22559.28s]  but the problem is, is if like you're shoving your face
[22559.28s -> 22560.40s]  into trying to learn a meta champ
[22560.40s -> 22562.24s]  that you just don't enjoy the play style of,
[22562.24s -> 22565.04s]  you're never gonna actually be good at the champion
[22565.04s -> 22567.56s]  because you're like, it's like you're working, right?
[22567.56s -> 22569.40s]  But the best way to learn the champions
[22569.40s -> 22571.84s]  and learn how to play the game is to have fun.
[22571.84s -> 22573.76s]  Because if you're not having fun at some point,
[22573.76s -> 22578.64s]  You're not gonna be able to learn how to play because you're not gonna be able to put in the hours or put in the games
[22578.64s -> 22582.76s]  And I'd be focused during the game. You're gonna be frustrated and if you're frustrated, you're not gonna be learning
[22583.12s -> 22585.12s]  So I would say just play something that's fun
[22585.28s -> 22597.04s]  The fun aspect is gonna be way more important. Where'd my music go?
[22597.84s -> 22611.06s]  I'm surprised. Can you guys even hear the music half the time?
[22611.06s -> 22614.14s]  I have it on so low that I'm not even sure you guys can hear it
[22615.06s -> 22617.14s]  It's just like barely background noise
[22617.70s -> 22642.38s]  Is this guy holding swap hostage?
[22643.70s -> 22667.30s]  join call and I'll swap dude he's holding swap hostage by the way if you
[22667.30s -> 22670.86s]  guys do like the stream don't forget to follow you can scroll down to see all
[22670.86s -> 22676.22s]  my socials too like tick-tock Instagram all that crap it's all
[22676.22s -> 22689.76s]  below the stream there's like links and shit and you know a man's gotta
[22689.76s -> 22692.08s]  eat you can use your twitch prime too if you want you know you're feeling
[22692.08s -> 22708.56s]  I'm gonna do a Kai'sa game. He went Lux
[22709.84s -> 22719.11s]  But I kind of want to play Kai'sa. What was the voice? This is what happens when I get close to the mic.
[22722.45s -> 22725.83s]  I should put the mic in front of my face more the mics like over to the corner
[22725.97s -> 22728.17s]  So the mic is like really badly directions
[22752.66s -> 22760.49s]  This is a cut-down game. There's Gragas always use AP. He doesn't go tank. He goes like AP
[22761.79s -> 22781.20s]  Kind of your last stands. That's fun. I should think ghost
[22782.04s -> 22791.95s]  Ghosts would have been so good this game. You tried Kate with shield bow. It's strong. Yeah, it's fun, huh?
[22791.95s -> 22795.54s]  I love Kate with shield bow. It's so fun
[22796.38s -> 22798.42s]  This would have been such a good ghost game
[22799.46s -> 22801.46s]  I'm frustrated. Oh well
[22802.94s -> 22819.50s]  I like wasn't paying attention. I I always wonder if I should go part of me always wants to go like
[22819.50s -> 22827.58s]  uh longsword 3 against thresh and zhaya but with kaisa i feel like you're on really specific
[22827.58s -> 22833.66s]  timers with kaisa so you have to go like it's really important to go doran so that
[22833.66s -> 22838.22s]  you can get the q upgrade timer on the right you know like on the right timing
[22839.74s -> 22846.14s]  i've been getting the q upgrade timer is just so big also this game i feel like i go bork
[22846.14s -> 22853.42s]  this game. Second, Bork or Wit's End. If Gragas is not ultra fed, I'll probably go Bork because
[22853.42s -> 22876.65s]  I don't want to get Wit's End just for Gragas. Okay, he started Q. Oh, Diana's starting on Wolves.
[22877.93s -> 22906.32s]  Okay, I need to get some coffee after this game. I'm getting drowsy. I should have done
[22906.32s -> 22911.28s]  the middle minion thing. I'm so bad. Like I should have legitimately just done the thing with
[22911.28s -> 22920.88s]  the minion. So when you know Thresh starts hook, you can still play up, right? I can play up,
[22920.88s -> 22940.79s]  I can play aggressive. I'm bad. I
[22942.03s -> 22944.03s]  Should have just killed the thresh
[22945.03s -> 22952.94s]  This is really bad man. We can't help we can't help because the wave the way the wave is going. Oh, I'm so bad
[22952.94s -> 22953.98s]  I fucked up
[22953.98s -> 22964.60s]  It should be fine. But I still like it were it it fucks us over early game because they fucked up very badly
[22965.96s -> 22969.60s]  Like I can't stress enough how badly they just fucked up, but it didn't matter
[22969.60s -> 22974.40s]  Okay, that's, that's happening apparently.
[22974.40s -> 22979.52s]  Don't worry guys, I'm the best Xayah player, or Kaisa player on the server.
[22979.52s -> 22988.88s]  It's me.
[22988.88s -> 22991.36s]  God, I am just literally playing like dog shits.
[22991.36s -> 23007.98s]  Why'd I pick Kaisa?
[23007.98s -> 23014.63s]  I just felt like playing her.
[23014.63s -> 23015.63s]  We gotta back.
[23015.63s -> 23018.07s]  We have to leave the wave in a bad spot.
[23018.07s -> 23028.90s]  Maybe she can push it, but like, Wukong's here soon.
[23028.90s -> 23032.70s]  Yeah, we just, okay, we got it, nice, not bad.
[23032.70s -> 23036.66s]  So we had to push the wave in there so that the wave will bounce back, but we had to do
[23036.66s -> 23038.26s]  it on a, it was a really bad timer.
[23038.26s -> 23041.34s]  Let me just say, I fucked up the entire early game of this game.
[23041.34s -> 23043.46s]  Like this game's, I'm so bad.
[23043.46s -> 23047.46s]  Essentially, what should have happened was level one, when they walked up, when Kaisa
[23047.46s -> 23050.26s]  and Thresh walked up level one, we should have killed them.
[23050.26s -> 23054.50s]  Like I should have just straight up hit the Thresh with the Lux, because Thresh walked
[23054.50s -> 23058.34s]  into our wave, because Wukong was level two ganking, should have just killed him.
[23058.34s -> 23059.58s]  I griefed that.
[23059.58s -> 23063.22s]  Because I went for the Xayah instead, I put myself in a spot where I took like 80% of
[23063.22s -> 23065.14s]  my HP for free, right?
[23065.14s -> 23069.94s]  Which put me behind and now the entire fight was like harder because I was low and then
[23069.94s -> 23074.06s]  we had to wait for the way- it was just- it was really bad.
[23074.06s -> 23076.06s]  Really.
[23076.06s -> 23078.58s]  That minion actually just did that.
[23078.58s -> 23086.23s]  I don't think we can kill this guy unless she can max range land a Q or something,
[23086.23s -> 23092.32s]  but yeah.
[23092.32s -> 23093.88s]  Is Zarya the best AD right now?
[23093.88s -> 23094.88s]  Uh, no.
[23094.88s -> 23096.80s]  I think Jinx is better.
[23096.80s -> 23101.20s]  I think Xayah is good, her late game, especially with like paired with an enchanter Xayah is
[23101.20s -> 23102.20s]  insane.
[23102.20s -> 23105.44s]  But I think Jinx is better for solo queue.
[23105.44s -> 23113.94s]  Uh oh, I actually have to flash.
[23113.94s -> 23119.64s]  That was a good play hook by that guy, I disrespected him.
[23119.64s -> 23125.64s]  I might have to leave because Wukong can just go here and dive me.
[23125.64s -> 23128.76s]  I actually just have to leave, this feels so bad.
[23128.76s -> 23132.36s]  You see how Wukong just used the plants?
[23132.36s -> 23134.16s]  If I stay, I can just die, right?
[23134.16s -> 23136.52s]  So I'm just misplaying all over the place.
[23136.52s -> 23137.98s]  I'm taking too much damage.
[23137.98s -> 23140.16s]  We're playing weak side right now, right?
[23140.16s -> 23143.80s]  What I mean by that is like, we know our Diana's top and we know their Wukong's
[23143.80s -> 23148.08s]  bot, so because of that, I need to play a lot less tradey.
[23148.08s -> 23150.44s]  Like I walked up and just let the Thresh flame me for free and I missed two
[23150.44s -> 23151.50s]  waves now.
[23151.50s -> 23154.84s]  I need to not do that because if I don't miss these waves, it doesn't matter if we're
[23154.84s -> 23156.24s]  weak siding because I'm not behind.
[23156.24s -> 23163.26s]  So it's just really stupid.
[23163.26s -> 23165.90s]  Now what I do want to do is I want to go check and see if the Wukong's like on
[23165.90s -> 23174.40s]  our camps or something, or if he's doing dragon or some shits.
[23174.40s -> 23178.60s]  I should not have used the blast cone, dude I am so bad!
[23178.60s -> 23181.08s]  I used the blast cone to just hit it.
[23181.08s -> 23201.78s]  It's playing support man, it makes your brain smaller, actually, like I swear playing
[23201.78s -> 23203.10s]  support makes my brain smaller.
[23203.10s -> 23233.02s]  Oh they're on dragon.
[23233.02s -> 23239.93s]  The Xayah's trolling, I think, pretty sure I just freeze this no?
[23239.93s -> 23245.57s]  With the Lux?
[23245.57s -> 23250.40s]  Yeah she's just trolling, I don't know what the fuck that was.
[23250.40s -> 23276.35s]  I took a little bit of damage, but she has to overextend now.
[23276.35s -> 23277.35s]  Not bad.
[23277.35s -> 23279.41s]  Okay, so the Xayah wanted to back.
[23279.41s -> 23282.19s]  The reason that I froze that was because Xayah wants to back, but she can't back
[23282.19s -> 23284.33s]  until we push the wave in.
[23284.33s -> 23285.89s]  Or until they push the wave in, right?
[23285.89s -> 23290.69s]  So it gives me time to kind of catch up on my back timer with the Xayah.
[23290.69s -> 23301.93s]  Because I'm, you know, a little bit behind in farm.
[23301.93s -> 23304.61s]  Thresh is definitely going to go mid here.
[23304.61s -> 23308.81s]  He's either going to go mid or he's going to try and hook us from the bush.
[23308.81s -> 23311.61s]  I think I'm going to shoot my W through all of the bushes here.
[23311.61s -> 23315.21s]  Okay, Thresh isn't in the bushes.
[23315.21s -> 23316.21s]  He's just Mia.
[23316.21s -> 23317.21s]  Yeah, we don't know where he is.
[23317.21s -> 23321.63s]  This is awkward because I can't really walk up.
[23321.63s -> 23324.03s]  I mean, I guess I'm almost 6, so I guess I could walk up.
[23324.03s -> 23326.07s]  Yeah, there he is.
[23326.07s -> 23332.60s]  Okay, we see him.
[23332.60s -> 23335.20s]  He is level 5, so it's...
[23335.20s -> 23336.20s]  We could probably actually fight.
[23336.20s -> 23345.64s]  Like, if this guy lands a binding, I might be able to just trade.
[23345.64s -> 23346.64s]  I just...
[23346.64s -> 23350.61s]  I in.
[23350.61s -> 23351.61s]  I'm dead.
[23351.61s -> 23352.61s]  I suck.
[23352.61s -> 23356.01s]  Honestly, I needed to...
[23356.01s -> 23358.01s]  I'm playing bad. That's on me.
[23359.69s -> 23362.17s]  Bilox is playing so good. I needed to, uh,
[23362.73s -> 23366.25s]  W, but then back up after the bind. I'm just, I'm mechanically
[23367.05s -> 23369.45s]  shitting on myself right now, like out of my mouth, just shit.
[23373.05s -> 23376.81s]  Because I knew exactly what was going to happen when I used W in front of the fucking Thresh's face. I was like,
[23377.61s -> 23379.61s]  here we go, you know what I mean?
[23379.85s -> 23383.45s]  Technically, we're both six and he's five, but it doesn't matter because if I get hooked,
[23384.25s -> 23387.63s]  I don't have enough damage, so.
[23387.71s -> 23393.55s]  Now here,
[23393.55s -> 23399.23s]  I'm gonna walk up and see if I can stop the zyia's back. Maybe maybe she's backing in a weird spot
[23401.53s -> 23404.49s]  Yeah, we stopped their backs huge. Okay now they're in trouble
[23406.41s -> 23409.85s]  So they really needed the back on that timer
[23411.21s -> 23415.93s]  Because they just want to fight right and because they just want to fight they want to go back, right?
[23417.85s -> 23422.62s]  No way
[23422.62s -> 23426.06s]  Dude, fuck off. I cannot dodge a hook right now to save my fucking life
[23426.06s -> 23435.11s]  Jesus Christ, what is my movement man like tilting myself right now?
[23435.11s -> 23448.53s]  I want to stay for this wave, but mid is Mia. Yeah, I can't
[23450.37s -> 23454.77s]  It feels so bad because I needed one more wave to get double pickaxe
[23455.53s -> 23457.29s]  So I can get my upgrade
[23457.29s -> 23461.29s]  Because like normally you go noon quiver pickaxe pickaxe if you go noon pick pick
[23461.73s -> 23464.41s]  It gives you enough AD to get your Q upgrade, right?
[23464.41s -> 23468.41s]  And that's like the whole point. You don't need Kraken. You just need your Q upgrade because your Q upgrades when you start bursting
[23469.29s -> 23474.07s]  But because I got hooked under the turrets even though we got a kill I had to back and I couldn't get my timer
[23474.55s -> 23488.52s]  I'm so trash. I need some coffee. That's what it is man. I swear to God
[23489.28s -> 23491.28s]  Coffee is my savior. It'll save me
[23520.44s -> 23523.08s]  That wave actually just did that to me holy shits
[23524.36s -> 23526.60s]  We don't actually have to do anything here crazy
[23527.44s -> 23547.61s]  Nice well played
[23548.81s -> 23560.25s]  Nice nice nice
[23560.93s -> 23574.22s]  That was good to be too. All right. I got my queue upgrade now. We're chillin. Oh now we're hella chillin. Oh
[23575.58s -> 23577.34s]  Yeah, baby
[23577.34s -> 23583.47s]  You know what it is. It's like
[23584.35s -> 23594.20s]  I'm playing the fights too quick. I just got to slow down and like think I'm like too hyped up
[23594.20s -> 23609.03s]  I really don't want to miss this wave. There's a person right there. Oh
[23610.59s -> 23612.59s]  Shit, let's go
[23612.59s -> 23613.59s]  Yeah, he's dead.
[23613.59s -> 23620.89s]  Okay, I'm gonna go farm bot while that guy gets that.
[23620.89s -> 23632.32s]  This Lux is really good.
[23632.32s -> 23637.00s]  I kind of want to- oh, I can't get this plate, fuck.
[23637.00s -> 23638.16s]  What?
[23638.16s -> 23639.64s]  What?
[23639.64s -> 23640.64s]  That was BS.
[23640.64s -> 23648.86s]  Okay, you know what, I'll just take my entire HP bar really quick on the turret,
[23648.86s -> 23651.34s]  it's not a big deal, guys.
[23651.34s -> 23654.10s]  I'm just- I'm that good at the game, like, I don't mean to brag, but like,
[23654.10s -> 23660.00s]  you know, professional gamer over here, like, you know, trying to be the one with
[23660.00s -> 23661.76s]  some blessings, like, I got you.
[23661.76s -> 23686.56s]  Dude, look how big my shield is.
[23686.56s -> 23687.56s]  Wait.
[23687.56s -> 23692.08s]  You son of a bitch.
[23692.08s -> 23713.31s]  I mean she's dead, but I got outplayed man.
[23713.31s -> 23714.31s]  Motherfucker.
[23714.31s -> 23727.44s]  Alright, they forfeited.
[23727.44s -> 23728.44s]  Nice.
[23728.44s -> 23734.57s]  Well now I need to make some coffee.
[23734.57s -> 23735.57s]  I'm playing bad.
[23735.57s -> 23737.61s]  Give me a sec.
[23737.61s -> 23738.61s]  We're playing real bad.
[23738.61s -> 23739.61s]  I need some coffee.
[23739.61s -> 23755.31s]  Nice though, we hit 400 LP.
[23755.31s -> 23756.31s]  Let's go.
[23756.31s -> 23775.11s]  We just need 150 more. We need 550. I think 550 is GM. I didn't do anything that game by the way. I did nothing.
[23776.55s -> 23778.55s]  I could play another ad carry game. That was fun.
[23779.31s -> 23781.39s]  I'm gonna grab some coffee. I'll be right back.
[23782.79s -> 23785.77s]  Talks amongst yourselves boys. I believe in you.
[23786.87s -> 23790.39s]  You can look at my ad carry tier list that we've been trying to figure out how to do.
[23791.23s -> 23793.97s]  Enjoy. I'll be right back. Grab some coffee.
[23795.67s -> 23896.66s]  Fucking A. Alright.
[23897.54s -> 23898.04s]  I'm back.
[23899.14s -> 23899.64s]  Let's go.
[23901.68s -> 23902.18s]  Up up.
[23903.98s -> 23904.48s]  Sweet.
[23906.38s -> 23907.18s]  We back boys.
[23911.50s -> 23912.00s]  We back.
[23918.75s -> 23919.75s]  Time is at five.
[23919.75s -> 23920.55s]  Ooh.
[23921.05s -> 23922.45s]  I could probably play for like another hour.
[23923.35s -> 23925.45s]  And then I gotta get off and make some dinner.
[23927.35s -> 23928.55s]  Do some other shit.
[23929.05s -> 23929.95s]  You know what I'm saying?
[23939.84s -> 23940.44s]  Where were we?
[23940.44s -> 23941.74s]  Oh yeah, we're making the tier list.
[23941.74s -> 23943.34s]  Yeah, I think Varus is really good at A.
[23944.94s -> 23946.74s]  I think Varus is good at A tier because um...
[23946.84s -> 23953.28s]  In my opinion, Varus is never really like a bad pick almost like sometimes he's bad,
[23953.28s -> 23957.20s]  but I think he's just, you can play him on hit or you can play him without it.
[23957.20s -> 23958.20s]  Right?
[23958.20s -> 23961.08s]  So he's got two builds that you can do based on the game and the team comp.
[23961.08s -> 23964.04s]  His ulti is pretty much always useful.
[23964.04s -> 23968.40s]  Like just having a stun like a root on a champion is always going to be useful.
[23968.40s -> 23971.20s]  Then you have, he's got very long range like engage.
[23971.20s -> 23974.02s]  You can safely kill people with his ult and his Q.
[23974.02s -> 23977.62s]  You can build him poke where like before objectives you can make picks really easily, you can
[23977.62s -> 23980.36s]  poke people out before the objective, get them low.
[23980.36s -> 23984.22s]  His lane phase is really good if you understand like how to play Varus, his lane phase is
[23984.22s -> 23985.30s]  exceptional.
[23985.30s -> 23991.16s]  He also has, in the meta currently, I feel like he's just like a good pick.
[23991.16s -> 23994.94s]  I don't think he's as good as Draven and Jinx for solo queue, but I do think he's
[23994.94s -> 23997.78s]  really good in general.
[23997.78s -> 24000.22s]  You can climb with him really easily.
[24000.22s -> 24003.42s]  And then I'd put Ashe here too.
[24003.42s -> 24009.46s]  Maybe Ashe? I don't know who I'd put in front. Ashe or Varus. I feel like maybe Ashe. Or
[24009.46s -> 24013.10s]  maybe Varus. I think Ashe is really underrated though. I think Ashe is super, super good
[24013.10s -> 24032.82s]  right now. I think Ashe is super good because... Sorry, I'm trying to think. She's
[24032.82s -> 24038.72s]  basically the same idea as Varus. She's a little different, but she's the same idea.
[24038.72s -> 24042.34s]  She controls lane phase pretty well. Right, like her lane isn't too bad. She also
[24042.34s -> 24049.12s]  has like her R always useful no matter what. So like you always have use with Ashe, you
[24049.12s -> 24054.68s]  always have use with Varus R, like they just stuns, snares, etc. on soloq. She's also really
[24054.68s -> 24058.06s]  good at being annoying in teamfights, like you can take Ghost on Ashe, and you can
[24058.06s -> 24062.84s]  just voli, sit outside their range, and you just basically solo people. And she
[24062.84s -> 24066.88s]  actually has decent scaling on her crit now, so you can go a bunch of builds
[24066.88s -> 24070.92s]  too, like I think you can go Bork Ashe, you can go Kraken Slayer Ashe into Bork,
[24070.92s -> 24074.18s]  Or you could go Kraken Slayer into IE or you can go Kraken Slayer into like...
[24075.72s -> 24078.52s]  Whatever, you can go Shieldbow Ashe if they have tanks, you can go Galeforce Ashe.
[24078.52s -> 24081.52s]  Or you can just do a lot of different builds on Ashe and I think she's really versatile.
[24082.00s -> 24084.00s]  You could also just go the On-Hit build if you really want.
[24084.00s -> 24084.50s]  I...
[24084.98s -> 24086.80s]  I think the Rageblade build sucks personally.
[24086.80s -> 24088.54s]  I think that if I was gonna go On-Hit I would just be like...
[24088.94s -> 24090.74s]  Shieldbow Wit's End into like...
[24091.40s -> 24094.00s]  Bork or some shit if I was actually gonna do that or Shieldbow...
[24094.36s -> 24095.92s]  Bork or Bork-Wit's or whatever.
[24096.18s -> 24096.68s]  But...
[24097.48s -> 24097.98s]  Yeah.
[24097.98s -> 24108.33s]  I don't know, Ezreal's probably A tier too, like I said, Ezreal's really gated by skill,
[24108.33s -> 24112.27s]  so I don't want to put him in, I think if you could play Ezreal perfectly, he'd be
[24112.27s -> 24117.89s]  at the top of S, like he would just be above Jinx, just best champion in the game,
[24117.89s -> 24121.27s]  if you could never miss a skillshot, like 100% accuracy, play him perfect, like
[24121.27s -> 24123.07s]  the champ's insane, right?
[24123.07s -> 24126.31s]  It's absolutely crazy how good that champ is if you can play him perfect, but you're
[24126.31s -> 24130.55s]  like people are humans etc so I think he's like an A tier pick in solo queue
[24130.55s -> 24133.43s]  because you can get countered like he's not blindable you can get countered
[24133.43s -> 24137.35s]  pretty easily by good players people play like push comps people play dive
[24137.35s -> 24141.63s]  comps like early game I mean in lane and shits like because Ezreal's lane
[24141.63s -> 24145.99s]  is like not it's not bad but it's very difficult to play Ezreal well in
[24145.99s -> 24149.95s]  lane you got to be good mechanically and I don't think even like I've
[24149.95s -> 24154.91s]  seen like challenger players who can't play Ezreal so he's not easy
[24154.91s -> 24196.58s]  you know what I'm saying what's up boys so I was gonna ban kindred but I
[24196.58s -> 24206.28s]  couldn't find her I hate kindred yo how we doing tonight
[24206.28s -> 24247.72s]  how's everybody's day okay so this guy's picking thresh again thresh into
[24247.72s -> 24261.60s]  Rakan thresh is actually pretty good in the Rakan they have Xayah thresh
[24261.60s -> 24288.42s]  again let's play Jinx I like Jinx here even though it is against thresh
[24288.42s -> 24291.72s]  Jinx is a little scary, right? But I kind of like her in this situation.
[24292.54s -> 24304.44s]  Do I want free boots? Nah, I think I want to be able to get early boots this game.
[24304.94s -> 24309.21s]  Because their team comp is like...
[24310.13s -> 24313.43s]  Oh, yeah, their team comp is really really annoying. So I kind of want to get
[24315.43s -> 24317.43s]  early boots.
[24318.33s -> 24320.33s]  I'll probably go Presence of Minds.
[24321.49s -> 24328.32s]  Although I think Overheal isn't bad. Actually, I'll go Overheal.
[24328.32s -> 24344.93s]  So, yeah, these runes look good, actually, let's do this, this, yeah, this is good, okay,
[24344.93s -> 24348.99s]  I kind of like these, this is good, I'm going to use these, okay, I'm taking claims this
[24348.99s -> 24354.31s]  game because they have Lissandra and Pantheon and Thresh, right, so with Lissandra, Pantheon
[24354.31s -> 24360.67s]  and Thresh, the game's going to be like really fast of like, okay, if they stun
[24360.67s -> 24364.35s]  I'm just gonna get CC chained and I'm just gonna die like after a bit, right?
[24364.71s -> 24367.69s]  It's gonna be like a stun and a stun and a stun and I'm just gonna die
[24368.01s -> 24401.70s]  So I'm like nah fuck that shit. Let's see if we can get this double you boys
[24402.40s -> 24417.55s]  Let's see if I can not fuck up the first three levels of the lane. Got chat restricted? Oh, yeah
[24418.43s -> 24423.22s]  It's for a while
[24423.22s -> 24448.75s]  It's riot's secret code to make it so I could actually play the game and climb without chatting. Okay, I
[24449.43s -> 24451.43s]  Should have warded this bush
[24452.75s -> 24457.33s]  I was drinking my coffee and I didn't think about it, but yeah, if you guys are against the hook champ
[24458.21s -> 24463.19s]  always ward this bush
[24463.19s -> 24465.19s]  right like right here you're gonna want to
[24465.83s -> 24468.03s]  ward here early against most hook champions
[24469.15s -> 24471.43s]  Because it gives you a very nice
[24472.03s -> 24475.47s]  Like they can't walk in here and cheese you they can't walk in here and cheese you
[24475.95s -> 24511.36s]  So you just don't get cheesed by anything. I mean, that's just I don't even know what I just saw
[24511.36s -> 24515.28s]  I'll be real. I don't know what the fuck just happened, but okay
[24516.52s -> 24518.52s]  Trying to push this wave as fast as I can
[24519.20s -> 24534.16s]  I'm not sure I can actually get it pushed fast enough, but we're gonna try it was close
[24539.44s -> 24542.84s]  No, I'm gonna let it just push. It's not a huge deal
[24543.68s -> 24545.68s]  It was very close though
[24545.92s -> 24553.38s]  We can just break the freeze right? Like it's not a huge deal. Are they supposed to win level one?
[24554.06s -> 24555.82s]  It depends. I mean
[24555.82s -> 24560.90s]  Xayah's not that good level 1. Like, Xayah's good because she has her feathers, right?
[24560.90s -> 24564.46s]  But if you can't stack your feathers level 1, Jinx has more damage.
[24564.86s -> 24567.30s]  And they stacked up for my rockets.
[24567.30s -> 24574.14s]  So I got like, I full stacked my Lethal Tempo and I just double AoE rocketed them over and over and over and over again, right?
[24574.14s -> 24580.72s]  And so, when they finally all-in'd, they were just behind in HP.
[24582.00s -> 24612.97s]  Also Thresh missed, he only had Flay. Damn. That was so close, man.
[24614.17s -> 24629.88s]  Like actually
[24629.88s -> 24634.12s]  If thresh had died there or not thresh if graves had died there. We just win the game
[24648.91s -> 24650.99s]  Yeah, this isn't good. Oh i'm gonna get flayed i'm dead
[24652.51s -> 24655.23s]  Maybe oh, maybe i'm not dead. I have to walk up like this
[24657.23s -> 24660.35s]  It was a really bad fight by the what what am I watching what the fuck
[24662.19s -> 24664.19s]  That was just a bad fight because um
[24665.71s -> 24669.47s]  We knew graves was bot and we knew that he was gonna kill in the jungle, right?
[24669.47s -> 24675.55s]  it. So like, my jungler already got outplayed by Graves once topside. You shouldn't ever
[24675.55s -> 24681.23s]  take another fight like that botside. You should just take the win, right? Like I rotated.
[24681.23s -> 24685.33s]  Now granted, the Rakan should have been there to help kill the Graves. Like when
[24685.33s -> 24689.79s]  I rotated, Rakan was still jacking off in lane, right? Like when I was here,
[24689.79s -> 24695.07s]  Rakan was like way down here. So the support should have rotated first, right?
[24695.07s -> 24698.15s]  Like I rotated, but the support should have been the one rotating. But again, he's
[24698.15s -> 24701.85s]  just a lot of the time you have support players who don't understand timers and
[24701.85s -> 24705.63s]  how to help jump nobody plays for jungle support players hate playing for jungle
[24705.63s -> 24712.51s]  in low elo so it's just not a thing so I tried to go over and help him but
[24712.51s -> 24718.99s]  I misplaced my traps a little bit and then the grave said a flash but
[24718.99s -> 24724.39s]  he got away and they tried to go in again when I was too low to actually
[24725.27s -> 24734.17s]  We just got lucky we didn't lose the game off that shit kind of does suck those is really strong now
[24749.69s -> 24753.05s]  Not bad. I should have all I should have I could have killed her. I
[24754.41s -> 24759.42s]  Suppose I could have killed the guy no joke. I totally could have killed him
[24760.64s -> 24764.52s]  If I had warded the lantern as he tried to take it I would have killed the Zaya
[24766.68s -> 24768.68s]  Cuz she ego'd the lantern there
[24778.30s -> 24782.32s]  She ego'd the lantern so hard if I had if I had warded it she dies there
[24782.32s -> 24802.12s]  This game is really interesting because the enemy bot lane is actually misplaying a lot.
[24802.12s -> 24806.20s]  Like they're really really really misplaying these fights and trades and shit.
[24806.20s -> 24813.56s]  But we can't abuse it because the Graves has so much control of the game right now
[24813.56s -> 24817.92s]  that we have to basically play safe permanently at the moment and I can't do anything to
[24817.92s -> 24819.18s]  help my team.
[24819.18s -> 24820.40s]  It feels really bad.
[24820.40s -> 24849.99s]  You want my Kaisa game? Yeah, there we go. See look, Graves is bot again, man. This is so rough. Graves is mid.
[24853.54s -> 24855.54s]  I want to kill this as fast as I can.
[24855.74s -> 24872.58s]  We can fight these guys 2v2 actually. Wait, why didn't he just go in?
[24872.58s -> 24886.82s]  I don't know why he didn't just double you immediately. Like the Rakan waited. Oh, that tilts me.
[24887.48s -> 24891.84s]  Like when she was against the wall here, he should have immediately W'd her.
[24894.18s -> 24898.88s]  Because if he W's from vision there, right, and she's against the wall,
[24899.10s -> 24905.18s]  It helps us so much because then I can I can overlay my flame chomps on top of the I
[24905.74s -> 24908.46s]  Can overlay my flame chomps directly on top of the Zaya?
[24909.18s -> 24912.50s]  right as the fights happening rather than like having to
[24913.02s -> 24916.02s]  Work around the fight because thresh is in my face type shit, you know
[24916.50s -> 24924.68s]  so we're just we're honestly just losing because we're not pulling the trigger fast enough and
[24925.84s -> 24928.40s]  We can't play aggressive when we can pull the trigger
[24930.48s -> 24933.84s]  Right, like we're losing cuz we can't pull the trigger fast enough and when we can pull the trigger, it's
[24934.28s -> 24942.46s]  The wrong time we do this right now we get dragon the bot lane backed. We get dragon here. I
[24949.01s -> 24952.61s]  Want to go I actually want to go
[24953.41s -> 24957.94s]  With the enemy bot lane didn't back
[24958.22s -> 24959.78s]  Okay, they're trolling
[24959.78s -> 24964.84s]  They lost an objective for free here. This is really good
[24965.56s -> 24968.56s]  So the enemy bot lane we fight this by the way, we just we can just straight up fight
[24969.40s -> 24982.90s]  That right there is how you lantern are you more to lantern by the way? Oh
[24982.90s -> 24987.34s]  Oh, I did that guy so dirty.
[24987.34s -> 24993.10s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[24993.10s -> 25001.11s]  Bye guys.
[25001.11s -> 25002.35s]  I didn't know Pantheon was Mia.
[25002.35s -> 25004.67s]  That was my bad.
[25004.67s -> 25009.90s]  I was like going, I was too happy with warding the lantern.
[25009.90s -> 25015.42s]  My bad.
[25015.42s -> 25019.10s]  I can't believe the enemy team greeted that hard though for gold.
[25019.10s -> 25032.04s]  Like that's actually nuts to me.
[25032.04s -> 25036.52s]  No yeah, the Xayah's egoing like crazy.
[25036.52s -> 25041.52s]  The problem is I can't abuse it constantly because like obviously like I need teammates,
[25041.52s -> 25042.52s]  right?
[25042.52s -> 25052.35s]  But I can kind of abuse it like, uh, but it's much harder by yourself because as
[25052.35s -> 25056.91s]  you can see like I'm not playing poorly, but we're getting like we're getting shit
[25056.91s -> 25057.91s]  on.
[25057.91s -> 25059.23s]  Shit on is a bad word.
[25059.23s -> 25081.01s]  We're getting like, oh, come on, man.
[25081.01s -> 25089.39s]  They misplayed that so badly, but Rakan just ate the fucking whatever.
[25089.39s -> 25091.61s]  I'm not gonna blame Rakan, it's fine.
[25091.61s -> 25092.93s]  I'm still sad about that though.
[25092.93s -> 25096.67s]  They misplayed that so incredibly badly.
[25096.67s -> 25098.85s]  Like so badly.
[25098.85s -> 25102.91s]  It was just that like Rakan all-in'd the Thresh with his ultimate, but all he had
[25102.91s -> 25108.61s]  to do there was use his E to come back to me and then play front-to-back afterward.
[25108.61s -> 25111.93s]  But he sat there autoing the Thresh.
[25111.93s -> 25114.81s]  But you don't need to auto him, you just need to engage and then I can maybe
[25114.81s -> 25120.03s]  play after it.
[25120.03s -> 25122.11s]  I probably could have double-killed them there too.
[25122.11s -> 25126.58s]  I kind of messed up. My team wants out
[25127.94s -> 25130.90s]  It's not it's it's silly because the game's not even over
[25134.71s -> 25137.37s]  Like we actually can win this game so incredibly easily
[25138.35s -> 25143.43s]  So easily if we just play it correctly because their balling is really fucking bad. I
[25143.99s -> 25147.87s]  Didn't want to be mean but I'll just be mean their ballings really fucking bad
[25148.55s -> 25157.18s]  Well, I'm dead
[25157.18s -> 25159.18s]  They're still bad
[25159.90s -> 25162.62s]  I'm just egoing. That was my ego
[25163.98s -> 25166.76s]  I still stand by it. I still think they're bad
[25167.54s -> 25173.22s]  This guy's just playing 1v3 mid. The Thresh has not been mid one time. So it must be the top laner
[25173.78s -> 25181.45s]  I'm I am so frustrated right now with this game
[25185.68s -> 25191.70s]  Because I feel like we should have won so many all-ins that we didn't win barely like one like barely right like barely
[25191.70s -> 25194.52s]  Didn't win small wins. I thought we should have won all of them
[25196.60s -> 25200.62s]  Like they they didn't land like a good all-in once Thresh didn't land a single hook once
[25202.24s -> 25207.24s]  And this is my Rakan like he just tried to he just used his R to try and engage
[25207.32s -> 25215.46s]  I think Nocturne is done mentally
[25216.18s -> 25221.15s]  Okay, so in games like this
[25221.35s -> 25225.05s]  Like this Thresh is so bad. Oh
[25248.17s -> 25250.17s]  Let's go, baby
[25250.63s -> 25252.15s]  huge
[25252.15s -> 25257.38s]  That was so huge. Let's fucking go
[25275.08s -> 25280.88s]  Like I I'm gonna hit no at 15 because dude, I really don't want to lose to this Thresh and Azaiya
[25280.88s -> 25286.84s]  Like this Thresh is doing the most the most ego shit I've ever seen and
[25287.88s -> 25292.68s]  He's just getting away with shit like right there Thresh walks up whiffs every spell
[25294.08s -> 25300.02s]  And expects to get away with that shit. Nah, nah, nah, we win these we win these trust give me let me cook
[25300.02s -> 25301.80s]  Let me cook. I
[25301.80s -> 25303.80s]  Seen my team to let me cook a bit, you know
[25304.60s -> 25308.98s]  Like we had a bad early game had to play weak side. Let me cook. Let me cook
[25308.98s -> 25310.98s]  We are chillin.
[25310.98s -> 25374.00s]  If I landed that, that would have been sick.
[25374.00s -> 25375.48s]  Thresh is top two, we can kill this guy.
[25375.48s -> 25385.28s]  Come on guys, don't forfeit.
[25385.28s -> 25386.80s]  Guys, the game is winnable.
[25386.80s -> 25388.24s]  Oh my god.
[25388.24s -> 25390.56s]  Dude, the game is...
[25390.56s -> 25394.52s]  How is the Rakan gonna forfeit?
[25394.52s -> 25398.52s]  Dude, that game is so winnable, it hurts.
[25398.52s -> 25407.80s]  Like dude, really?
[25407.80s -> 25413.64s]  That actually is so infuriating.
[25413.64s -> 25422.67s]  so infuriating, man. That game was so incredibly winnable. Like, look at this. I did more damage
[25422.67s -> 25430.27s]  than every single player on the enemy team. If my team just relaxed, we win the game
[25430.27s -> 25437.83s]  a thousand times over that game. Like, the game is over. We have a Rakan, a Rumble,
[25437.83s -> 25443.35s]  and a Wukong for me to sit behind. And we saw how bad their bot lane was, right?
[25443.35s -> 25447.45s]  I have cleanse for the only way they can kill me.
[25447.45s -> 25448.29s]  Whatever, man.
[25448.29s -> 25450.15s]  Dude, I wish to God, I'm gonna report them all.
[25450.15s -> 25453.27s]  Like these fuckers, I guarantee I get a notification.
[25453.27s -> 25457.54s]  There's no way these people are not toxic.
[25457.54s -> 25459.18s]  There's no way you int this,
[25459.18s -> 25462.00s]  like you just want out of the game after a fucking,
[25462.00s -> 25463.92s]  your team is just doing well.
[25465.30s -> 25468.64s]  Nah, man, the score is 10 to 14.
[25469.50s -> 25474.06s]  10 to 14.
[25474.06s -> 25481.50s]  You have a fed AD carry.
[25481.50s -> 25482.34s]  Look at this.
[25482.34s -> 25488.46s]  Dude, we forfeited, we were down 2.5k.
[25488.46s -> 25491.66s]  We had a better scaling comp than them.
[25491.66s -> 25493.16s]  Like, we outscaled them.
[25494.94s -> 25498.82s]  We have two dragons, we outscaled them,
[25498.82s -> 25502.42s]  and we're down 2.5k.
[25502.42s -> 25505.02s]  And my team rage hits forfeit.
[25506.50s -> 25510.10s]  Oh my god, that's so gross.
[25510.10s -> 25518.06s]  That is so disgusting.
[25518.06s -> 25519.16s]  So disgusting.
[25524.34s -> 25536.10s]  Why am I in a game with this player? I'm 412 LP masters. I was in a game just now with a 7 LP
[25536.10s -> 25546.46s]  masters jungler and he's not on a smurf. This is not a smurf account because last season this
[25546.46s -> 25557.16s]  guy was d4. So he's not on a smurf. Why is this player in my game? Why is this player in
[25557.16s -> 25570.25s]  in a 400 LP master game. Why? Or rather, why am I in a Diamond 1 game? You can go to his
[25570.25s -> 25574.81s]  previous games, he doesn't even have good MMR. Like if you look at these games, they're
[25574.81s -> 25580.17s]  all like, what, 100, 200 LP, right? Why am I in this game? Why did you put me in
[25580.17s -> 25586.21s]  a game with this player? Like this guy, I don't even care if he sucks. I'm more
[25586.21s -> 25591.25s]  frustrated at the fact that these players mental boom at the first sign of any negativity.
[25591.25s -> 25594.21s]  Look at this, they just give up.
[25594.21s -> 25598.05s]  First sign of anything negative, they go next.
[25598.05s -> 25601.61s]  Like I actually could have 1v9'd this game too, like actually.
[25601.61s -> 25605.45s]  But I'm not allowed to try and 1v9 because my team wants out of the game at fucking
[25605.45s -> 25607.93s]  4 minutes, or 15 minutes.
[25607.93s -> 25610.71s]  That sucks man.
[25610.71s -> 25613.13s]  The new system is trash.
[25613.13s -> 25618.53s]  Like I'm sorry but the 4-5-15 system is good sometimes.
[25618.53s -> 25622.33s]  They should have a requirement that you have to be losing by X amount of gold for it to
[25622.33s -> 25624.13s]  kick in.
[25624.13s -> 25626.09s]  That should be it.
[25626.09s -> 25627.81s]  They should have a requirement.
[25627.81s -> 25634.46s]  You have to be losing by 5k plus for it to work at 15.
[25634.46s -> 25639.66s]  Like there needs to be something where there's a requirement because people are
[25639.66s -> 25640.90s]  so stupid.
[25640.90s -> 25641.90s]  Right?
[25641.90s -> 25643.94s]  Like that game was 100% ours.
[25643.94s -> 25650.46s]  We had 2 dragons, we're down 2000 gold at 16 minutes, and Wukong's 3 and 1.
[25650.46s -> 25661.66s]  We were down four kills. Wukong's three and one. I'm literally insanely strong.
[25661.66s -> 25665.58s]  Even though we got weak-sided, I'm still winning. We just 2v2'd them bot side of the map, right?
[25665.58s -> 25674.06s]  We just won a 2v2. Rumble's just like, like, ah, sorry, I'm just mad. I'm mad.
[25674.06s -> 25677.66s]  Like they need to require, they need to require something other than four people,
[25677.66s -> 25685.18s]  like require four people and a gold lead or something. Like that's so cancer. That's
[25685.18s -> 25695.04s]  so fucking frustrating man like I can't believe how bad people's mentals are like the okay I get it
[25695.04s -> 25699.36s]  the the rumble and the the rumble and the nocturne I understand wanting to forfeit okay
[25700.00s -> 25702.88s]  okay they're having a bad game they want out they're raging they need to get their
[25702.88s -> 25713.58s]  frustration I get it but why are we forfeiting when wukong is three and one I have seven
[25713.58s -> 25720.50s]  of our kp i'm the ad carry i'm very i just got my mythic we have two dragons and rakan's
[25720.50s -> 25734.38s]  forfeiting to i don't know man that's just frustrating as all like i'll be real i carry
[25734.38s -> 25766.45s]  this game every day of the week like every day of the week i carry those so apparently
[25766.45s -> 25772.67s]  riot is doing something about smurfing though and i can't wait until they do this is
[25772.67s -> 25776.83s]  actually a really good thing that I wanted to talk about earlier in the stream but I forgot.
[25777.63s -> 25782.03s]  Apparently Riot is like doing something to make smurfing harder because like apparently smurfing
[25782.03s -> 25787.39s]  is outrageous right now and I kind of think that they need to stop this too.
[25788.51s -> 25794.91s]  So there's a thing you can do in solo queue right now where you can make a new account
[25794.91s -> 25801.51s]  and you can duo with somebody on different accounts on a new account and
[25801.51s -> 25811.57s]  your MMR doesn't actually get like lowered so if you win a game let's say
[25811.57s -> 25817.89s]  you win a game I think this is just him leveling the account but let's say
[25817.89s -> 25824.58s]  let's say you win a game and in that game you duo with somebody in a
[25824.58s -> 25828.98s]  lower MMR right now when you do in a lower MMR I don't know if this guy did
[25828.98s -> 25832.66s]  this or not but when you do with somebody in a lower MMR your MMR is
[25832.66s -> 25837.54s]  based on now the game thinks that you're in that MMR and you can do it
[25837.54s -> 25842.26s]  in placements so in your very first games for some reason there's no MMR
[25842.26s -> 25847.90s]  lock on placements so you can in your placements duo with somebody who's
[25847.90s -> 25853.26s]  like bronze right and you can play with them and then the game thinks
[25853.26s -> 25859.10s]  you're still winning so it keeps amplifying your MMR. So I'm describing this really poorly but
[25859.10s -> 25865.42s]  essentially you can duo in lower ELOs and the game doesn't know your MMR belongs in that ELO
[25865.42s -> 25869.10s]  because you're winning in that ELO. The game can't figure that out for some reason, the
[25869.10s -> 25876.14s]  algorithm. So when they stopped duo queueing it still inflated them, it still inflated their
[25876.14s -> 25880.62s]  MMR to where it would be if they had solo queued. Does that make sense in what I'm
[25880.62s -> 25886.36s]  saying. So it basically says that they went like 10-0 in their placements, right? So now
[25886.36s -> 25892.38s]  they're in like master tier MMR from a brand new account. So now those people are in
[25892.38s -> 25904.87s]  like D1 masters MMR, but they played, they won in gold. I also don't think smurfing
[25904.87s -> 25912.65s]  should be so easily accessible. Like this guy's not a bad player per se, but I don't
[25912.65s -> 25915.69s]  think he's a master tier player, right? Like this guy's a Rumble player on a new
[25915.69s -> 25920.81s]  accounts. From that game alone, the fact he gave up tells me he's not a good player.
[25940.23s -> 25947.51s]  Dude, I'm a heavy advocator for, like, you have to attach a verification to your accounts.
[25949.19s -> 25953.27s]  I know Riot would never do that, but I'm a heavy advocator for having to attach
[25953.27s -> 25962.94s]  verification to play ranked. I think it'd be great, honestly. I think it would help so much.
[25974.97s -> 25978.89s]  If you get your verification account banned, are you done for it? Yeah. You have to get a VPN
[25978.89s -> 25984.09s]  to play other than like you would have to that's my point though like if you
[25984.09s -> 26007.02s]  get your verified account banned right like okay that counts done like I said
[26007.02s -> 26011.62s]  I don't think riot would ever do it because it's too it's too extreme and
[26011.62s -> 26014.94s]  I don't think riot has the balls to ever do that shit VPN is only five
[26014.94s -> 26018.18s]  dollars yeah but dude are you gonna tell me that you're gonna you're
[26018.18s -> 26022.50s]  gonna buy it people who get banned on accounts typically get banned
[26022.50s -> 26026.18s]  And consistently, that's why they're making smurfs.
[26026.18s -> 26027.38s]  Right?
[26027.38s -> 26029.34s]  So you're telling me somebody's gonna be willing
[26029.34s -> 26033.98s]  to pay $5 for a new phone number verification or whatever
[26033.98s -> 26036.18s]  every time they have to make a new account?
[26036.18s -> 26047.58s]  They're not.
[26047.58s -> 26049.22s]  Not you, me.
[26049.22s -> 26051.78s]  Lulu, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[26051.78s -> 26052.60s]  Don't I have smurfs?
[26052.60s -> 26054.48s]  Yeah, I do.
[26054.48s -> 26057.10s]  And I stand by all my smurfs should be attached
[26057.10s -> 26059.78s]  to the same, like, account.
[26059.78s -> 26062.34s]  Like, if you make a smurf, okay,
[26062.34s -> 26064.56s]  This is what I think should happen.
[26064.56s -> 26067.50s]  You should be able to put all of your smurfs on one account.
[26067.50s -> 26073.94s]  So you can make smurfs and you can add that smurf verification to an account.
[26073.94s -> 26074.94s]  But it's kind of like battle.net.
[26074.94s -> 26075.94s]  Does that make sense?
[26075.94s -> 26080.14s]  You know how like battle.net has all your accounts in the battle.net thing, but you
[26080.14s -> 26082.14s]  can sign into battle.net?
[26082.14s -> 26087.10s]  I think that the way to make it viable would be like you could put all, if you
[26087.10s -> 26091.14s]  didn't have a second phone number or didn't want one, you could put smurfs up to like
[26091.14s -> 26092.14s]  a limit.
[26092.14s -> 26096.22s]  three smurfs or like two smurfs in your main account right so you can have like three total
[26096.22s -> 26102.62s]  accounts and you you would have to like you could add those to the same like omega account right
[26102.62s -> 26107.42s]  and that omega account could be your verified account now if any of your accounts get punished
[26107.42s -> 26116.08s]  on your omega account all of your accounts get punished so if any of your accounts get
[26116.08s -> 26132.86s]  punished all of them get punished like i feel like that'd be a good play maybe i'm wrong but
[26132.86s -> 26136.70s]  But I feel like it would work. Yo, what's up rush? I called you brush. What's up RF? Oh
[26141.13s -> 26143.13s]  What do I want to play? I?
[26143.37s -> 26145.07s]  Don't know. I
[26145.07s -> 26154.00s]  Don't know what I want to do here. It's a range. Okay. I wish I didn't have cleanse cleanse is so worthless this game
[26154.00s -> 26156.00s]  like actually
[26156.40s -> 26158.40s]  Plans does nothing this game at all
[26158.96s -> 26163.92s]  I'm just down to some like maybe if the brand like tries to flash stun me or some shit
[26164.20s -> 26179.40s]  But I'm just like down a summoner. All right boys
[26180.36s -> 26186.47s]  We got night blue three on our team. There's a throwback
[26247.71s -> 26258.36s]  Damn oh we got him. I'm not gonna lie. I kind of looked like I was scripting
[26260.08s -> 26263.80s]  That that movement like if I was watching the game I'd be like what the fuck was that
[26265.84s -> 26267.94s]  Like my movement was real sauce
[26268.68s -> 26273.84s]  On that like that that all in right there. That's some that's some that's some sus movement
[26274.70s -> 26308.63s]  We can gank these guys they have no oh there's gonna be a ward in here
[26311.19s -> 26320.90s]  These people have no flashes
[26321.58s -> 26324.74s]  Enemy bot lane has no flash. This should be a free kill, honestly
[26326.10s -> 26329.94s]  We just let these guys push in they can't walk up and we just play for that
[26334.78s -> 26347.75s]  Even if they try and 3v3, we should just win the 3v3 because we're stronger. Oh, this guy's just dead. Yeah, it's I
[26358.38s -> 26360.38s]  need level 3
[26360.38s -> 26364.92s]  I kind of fucked my entire wave here
[26366.10s -> 26378.49s]  Yo, can we push? Is there any way we can just push this? Oh nice
[26379.53s -> 26391.54s]  Nice well played
[26392.54s -> 26393.98s]  Nice job
[26393.98s -> 26406.24s]  My Lulu's fucking fed as shit. Oh, I should have gone free boots this game. I
[26407.12s -> 26409.12s]  Didn't think about it
[26409.80s -> 26415.64s]  Cuz uh, I don't need Sork this game, you know how like the last game I told you I was going boots
[26415.64s -> 26417.64s]  I went boots for the
[26418.00s -> 26422.54s]  You know the fast boot to rush for thresh. I don't need that this game because
[26423.40s -> 26432.86s]  We just went through like faster mythic. So I should have gone free boots for like more efficiency
[26439.92s -> 26443.56s]  Can't understand and I could just kill a man
[26444.52s -> 26470.15s]  You can't understand. I could just kill a man. I want to push this wave
[26470.95s -> 26472.95s]  So we don't get like shit on
[26473.19s -> 26501.85s]  And I just kill a man
[26501.85s -> 26506.73s]  You can't understand just kill a man
[26507.89s -> 26514.77s]  Kill a man. There is something you can't understand
[26516.01s -> 26544.25s]  Get a man
[26544.25s -> 26546.25s]  hmm, I could go back here, but I
[26546.97s -> 26559.26s]  Don't see any reason to go back yet. I think I'm dead
[26564.32s -> 26569.36s]  Woohoo, I misplayed that that was actually really good by Lulu cooldowns. Nah, you're fine, man
[26569.36s -> 26574.40s]  I wish I could I wish I could tell him that he played it fine. I messed up not him. I messed up
[26574.40s -> 26579.08s]  I I feel bad. I want to like say no, you're fine
[26579.70s -> 26585.63s]  Cuz that was my bad. I
[26585.73s -> 26586.61s]  Should have okay
[26586.61s -> 26591.07s]  So when I flashed and I was running away from the twitch right the second that twitch flashed on me
[26591.07s -> 26593.07s]  I should have instantly started autoing him
[26593.23s -> 26598.51s]  Like I it was one extra auto like one single extra auto and it would have been fine
[26599.03s -> 26603.44s]  Why can't I tell her?
[26603.44s -> 26607.90s]  You know, I just choose not to type anymore
[26607.90s -> 26644.79s]  more. It's my choice. You know. Yeah. My choice. That guy's actually doing that, huh?
[26644.79s -> 26665.32s]  We win 2v2 really fucking hard. Especially with tier 2 boots, but I need, uh... Dude,
[26665.32s -> 26676.64s]  I am doing some scripty shit. I'm gonna be real. Dude, Lulu wasn't 6. I thought
[26676.64s -> 26685.86s]  she was 6. I'm so bad. I wish I could tell her my bad again. I'm actually trolling.
[26685.86s -> 26695.00s]  Like, I ran out of mana because I'm bad, and then I, uh, and then I thought she was
[26695.00s -> 26698.80s]  6, so I walked up to, like, tank the turret for a second, right?
[26698.80s -> 26701.08s]  Because I was like, oh shit, maybe I'll get, like, maybe we can kill this guy,
[26701.08s -> 26702.84s]  maybe Lulu has a spell or something.
[26702.84s -> 26704.32s]  I just, oh, I played bad.
[26704.32s -> 26705.32s]  My bad.
[26705.32s -> 26718.41s]  W that, make sure Ekko's not there.
[26718.41s -> 26721.53s]  I feel, I actually just feel so bad, because Lulu's actually playing really, this
[26721.53s -> 26723.33s]  is like the best support I've had all day.
[26723.33s -> 26725.85s]  Like, this guy's actually impressing me, right?
[26725.85s -> 26727.85s]  Like this guy's playing really well
[26727.93s -> 26760.54s]  And I'm just griefing
[26760.54s -> 26765.58s]  Lulu gave her life for me
[26765.62s -> 26767.62s]  Lulu gave her life for me boys
[26767.74s -> 26772.32s]  Can we get a salute for Lulu in chat boys?
[26773.40s -> 26778.18s]  Can we get a salute? Can we get some love for Lulu?
[26779.86s -> 26806.83s]  She gave her life for the homie. Honestly, that was a really cool 2v2 by the way
[26808.47s -> 26812.59s]  Ohoho, Nightblue's smurfing it. What the fuck? Yo kill that bitch too
[26812.59s -> 26829.49s]  Nice!
[26829.49s -> 26830.49s]  No!
[26830.49s -> 26840.23s]  Oh!
[26840.23s -> 26876.41s]  If I lost that cannon, I would have lost my life in game.
[26876.41s -> 26878.69s]  I'm gonna go BT second item.
[26878.69s -> 26879.69s]  We have Lulu.
[26879.69s -> 26883.45s]  Uh, so wait, what the fuck is this pathing?
[26883.45s -> 26885.83s]  I clicked to go bot and it paths me in the weirdest spot ever.
[26885.83s -> 26890.41s]  We have Lulu, so I could actually go IE second, but I think if I go BT, I'll be
[26890.41s -> 26893.17s]  actually unkillable.
[26893.17s -> 26895.17s]  It'll be the greatest thing ever. I
[26897.00s -> 26901.74s]  Actually still might go ie as I'm thinking about it out loud by saying we have Lulu and not be stupid
[26901.74s -> 26906.36s]  But hey, I still might you know, I still might go ie but I don't know yet
[26906.36s -> 26909.10s]  We'll see cuz I took a lacrity. So it's like
[26910.28s -> 26925.11s]  Wow
[26925.11s -> 26949.16s]  No, I'm gonna die. I
[26949.16s -> 26951.16s]  Mean, I don't know why I flashed away
[26952.88s -> 26955.86s]  I'm playing bad. It's my fault. I
[26955.86s -> 26961.58s]  I think the game's over. So I'm just I'm playing bad. I'm like limit testing a little bit too much
[27045.41s -> 27063.03s]  Right, they haven't for put it though. What the fuck dude, how does this game? Oh, I'm even more mad. You guys have no idea
[27064.13s -> 27066.13s]  so I
[27066.43s -> 27073.91s]  It's 24 to 8. The enemy team doesn't forfeit, but my team forfeits when the score is 10 to 14
[27075.43s -> 27077.81s]  And we're only down a thousand golds
[27095.49s -> 27097.11s]  Sorry, I was
[27097.11s -> 27099.11s]  That was my bad. I was tilted by
[27099.89s -> 27105.48s]  You know, I was thinking about about how they weren't forfeiting and I was getting mad
[27107.00s -> 27109.66s]  It is a little interesting because like I said, they still can't win
[27110.14s -> 27112.80s]  So I don't know who the fuck's hitting no, but it's probably echo
[27112.80s -> 27117.40s]  Well, no Echo's definitely hitting no, but like who else?
[27117.40s -> 27121.69s]  Maybe Brand?
[27121.69s -> 27122.69s]  Maybe Riven?
[27122.69s -> 27123.69s]  Maybe Riven's like yeah.
[27123.69s -> 27128.86s]  They did just get a thousand gold.
[27128.86s -> 27137.16s]  Alright, I should probably stop trolling.
[27137.16s -> 27140.20s]  I'd feel pretty silly if we lost because I'm bad.
[27140.20s -> 27143.04s]  After we like dumpstered him in lane that hard, I'd feel pretty silly if we
[27143.04s -> 27144.60s]  lost because I keep getting caught.
[27144.60s -> 27163.46s]  Alright, I should be unkillable now.
[27163.46s -> 27169.04s]  Like I'm not even farming, I'm actually griefing.
[27169.04s -> 27171.36s]  I should probably go make dinner after this game.
[27171.36s -> 27175.04s]  I want to keep playing because I'm playing well today, but like dude, my brain is starting
[27175.04s -> 27178.58s]  to go like, like I probably need to go make some food.
[27178.58s -> 27195.47s]  I'm getting the full ADHD brain experience going, so let's see if I can muster all
[27195.47s -> 27196.47s]  my focus.
[27196.47s -> 27204.63s]  Let's see if I can muster up all my focus really quick, just for, just push
[27204.63s -> 27210.09s]  out and finish this game.
[27210.09s -> 27213.15s]  We'll go terminator mode for the end of this game right now.
[27213.15s -> 27224.55s]  We'll muster up all of the, all of the focus.
[27224.55s -> 27225.55s]  Demon mode engaged boys.
[27225.55s -> 27277.69s]  God, that sounded really cringe.
[27277.69s -> 27280.73s]  I'm actually really impressed though, Nightblue played this game really really well.
[27280.73s -> 27289.68s]  Like I'll be honest, my last like thought of Nightblue was him being bad at League.
[27289.68s -> 27295.27s]  He played this game really well.
[27295.27s -> 27297.03s]  My man's gotten so much better.
[27297.03s -> 27305.08s]  Okay, nobody saw that.
[27305.08s -> 27306.08s]  Nobody saw that.
[27306.08s -> 27307.08s]  Nobody saw that.
[27307.08s -> 27308.08s]  Nobody saw that.
[27308.08s -> 27309.08s]  Nobody saw that.
[27309.08s -> 27310.08s]  Nobody saw that.
[27310.08s -> 27311.16s]  Nobody saw that.
[27311.16s -> 27322.08s]  Not one of you saw me flash after the echo ulted, not one of you.
[27322.08s -> 27323.08s]  Wasted flash?
[27323.08s -> 27336.60s]  assertive flash an assertive dominant flash not wasted at all they might actually go for
[27336.60s -> 27350.48s]  Baron here we should look for this like they could try oh he's here pretty sure the ribbons
[27350.48s -> 27357.76s]  here too though yep I did not mean to do that I didn't mean to hit the thing
[27357.76s -> 27362.80s]  I accidentally hit the blast plants that was that was an accident it was a literal
[27362.80s -> 27371.77s]  pure accidents like i i did not mean to hit it i was like i know ribbons here i'm gonna
[27371.77s -> 27376.65s]  wait for yasuo before i go over or before i do this right and i'm gonna bait him and i just
[27376.65s -> 27381.05s]  completely whiffed every like i'm bad we'll leave it at i'm bad that's a good way to

[27388.41s -> 27410.91s]  Yeah, that was a pedestrian flash, it HD as well, oh yeah, it's a plethora, a plethora
[27410.91s -> 27416.64s]  of terrible things.
[27416.64s -> 27446.83s]  I still gotta go to the gym tonight too, zed's bot, okay, I'm a little nervous
[27446.83s -> 27451.61s]  of like getting flanked, right, their junglers could just like sit in places.

[27473.00s -> 27500.62s]  hip here well let's go help our homie though like i'm actually so sad i'm playing so bad
[27502.06s -> 27504.62s]  like i was playing so good at the start and now i'm playing so bad
[27505.26s -> 27539.07s]  it actually makes me sad i was tanking for that guy all right let's just leave i don't
[27539.07s -> 27544.35s]  want to i don't want to throw the game for my my teammates because like i'm getting like you
[27544.35s -> 27549.35s]  You know, I've already died five times like a dip shit.
[27575.12s -> 27581.82s]  Where'd he go?
[27581.82s -> 27583.52s]  We should just push bot honestly.
[27585.06s -> 27596.32s]  We don't even need this dragon.
[27596.32s -> 27644.24s]  Okay, we just, I'm just gonna push bot.
[27644.24s -> 27660.78s]  Not bad, not bad at all.
[27660.78s -> 27662.34s]  I gotta give it, I wanna give it to Nightblue,
[27662.34s -> 27664.60s]  but I gotta give it to Lulu.
[27664.60s -> 27669.15s]  Lulu played that game so good.
[27669.15s -> 27670.11s]  I gotta give it to Lulu.
[27670.11s -> 27676.38s]  She played so fucking good.
[27676.38s -> 27693.97s]  Like actually, I don't even know if she's still in here.
[27713.04s -> 27722.29s]  I'm not a scripter.
[27722.29s -> 27732.97s]  She thinks I'm a, no, I'm serious.
[27732.97s -> 27739.54s]  She thinks I'm a scripter.
[27739.54s -> 27740.96s]  Bro, I'm streaming.
[27759.32s -> 27763.60s]  Dude, the homie thought I'm a scripter.
[27763.60s -> 27765.44s]  You know, I'll take it.
[27765.44s -> 27776.15s]  My ego feels good.
[27776.15s -> 27777.39s]  Honestly, that feels good.
[27777.39s -> 27778.95s]  That feels good.
[27778.95s -> 27779.79s]  Hi, lol.
[27779.79s -> 27785.00s]  Thought I was a scripter.
[27785.00s -> 27786.52s]  Dude, I'm not gonna lie though.
[27786.52s -> 27790.28s]  Some of those movements were sus as fuck that I was making.
[27790.28s -> 27793.88s]  Like I was, I like turned on the fucking mental scripts
[27793.88s -> 27794.96s]  for that game.
[27794.96s -> 27799.96s]  Some of those movements early were nuts.
[27799.96s -> 27803.32s]  Like, like just like this tiny little tiny little
[27803.32s -> 27806.80s]  movements I was doing early game and lane were crazy.
[27806.80s -> 27808.42s]  Like, look at this, watch this.
[27808.42s -> 27809.60s]  Like this movement right here, right?
[27809.60s -> 27816.95s]  Like look, I dodged that, right?
[27817.95s -> 27826.70s]  Then I walk up, cleanse the thing, kite down.
[27826.70s -> 27829.66s]  Like that, that movement is gross, man.
[27829.66s -> 27834.94s]  Look, that was actually some gross ass movement.
[27834.94s -> 27836.26s]  I'm not gonna lie.
[27836.26s -> 27837.10s]  Look at this.
[27838.22s -> 27841.56s]  In the corner, man, in the corner.
[27843.56s -> 27850.22s]  My brain was like, yo Andromeda, thank you, man.
[27850.22s -> 27851.86s]  Yo, you played really good.
[27851.86s -> 27853.16s]  Now I felt bad.
[27853.16s -> 27855.86s]  I felt so bad because I was griefing.
[27855.86s -> 27858.66s]  Like I was, like at the start of the game,
[27858.66s -> 27860.92s]  we were just snow, like I literally fucked up
[27860.92s -> 27870.76s]  like three times during like the really important fights and I was like, oh no, yeah, they were
[27870.76s -> 27871.76s]  the bits.
[27871.76s -> 27872.84s]  Can I play Callista?
[27872.84s -> 27873.84s]  Uh, I can.
[27873.84s -> 27881.57s]  I'm trying to figure out if I want to play a Callista game or if I want to go
[27881.57s -> 27889.23s]  make dinner.
[27889.23s -> 27892.05s]  There was one other movement that I thought was kind of nuts.
[27892.05s -> 27894.25s]  I did a really good movement to somewhere.
[27894.25s -> 27898.78s]  I don't remember what it was.
[27898.78s -> 27900.10s]  Here's where I fucked up.
[27900.10s -> 27905.06s]  So right now I should have just been, I, for some reason my brain lagged and
[27905.06s -> 27909.62s]  And I should have just been sitting here, um, I should have just cleansed and then started
[27909.62s -> 27911.54s]  fighting the Twitch.
[27911.54s -> 27914.92s]  For some reason I didn't cleanse, but this wasn't like your fault at all.
[27914.92s -> 27918.88s]  Like I, the second the Twitch flashed, I should have insta-cleansed the ignite
[27918.88s -> 27922.20s]  and I should have just been killing him, like right now, just like autoing, because
[27922.20s -> 27923.94s]  I can't get away from him, right?
[27923.94s -> 27930.05s]  But it took me an extra second, see how I, I started fighting him now?
[27930.05s -> 27935.79s]  Like I barely died, I wouldn't have died had I cleansed and had I just turned initially.
[27935.79s -> 27942.04s]  It was fine.
[27942.04s -> 27944.24s]  And then like here I fucked up too.
[27944.24s -> 27954.68s]  Because I went in and I thought we were 6.
[27954.68s -> 27957.24s]  Oh I could have killed that guy.
[27957.24s -> 27959.68s]  I should have gone forward one more.
[27959.68s -> 27961.24s]  Oh you know what I should have done there?
[27961.24s -> 27964.12s]  I should have gone forward one more auto, killed this guy.
[27964.12s -> 27966.24s]  Lulu would have gotten 6 off of the kill.
[27966.24s -> 27968.76s]  I would have used my speed to come back out.
[27968.76s -> 27969.84s]  Then she could have ulted me.
[27969.84s -> 27972.00s]  We could have killed the uh...
[27972.00s -> 27981.86s]  We could have killed the Twitch and then we could have turned on this Ekko too.
[27981.86s -> 27984.34s]  This was a really cool 2v2. I
[27985.62s -> 27987.62s]  Actually thought this 2v2 was really sick
[27992.51s -> 27999.61s]  Lulu's a real one for this man. Listen, you're a real one for this one. You just took the death to save me
[28004.62s -> 28006.22s]  respect
[28006.22s -> 28012.63s]  You're real one for that
[28012.63s -> 28019.39s]  That was so good
[28019.39s -> 28022.43s]  Jesus was fun. Yeah, geez, you were the best support I've had today
[28022.95s -> 28027.17s]  Like legitimately you played better than all the other players in the sealer. That's really good
[28027.17s -> 28033.17s]  Like I was surprised I was telling my stream. I was like, yeah, she's actually like they I said cheeks here
[28033.17s -> 28035.17s]  I don't know, you know, but I was like, yeah
[28036.01s -> 28039.49s]  She's playing super good. She's playing way better than all of my fucking teammates
[28044.34s -> 28046.06s]  Yo
[28046.06s -> 28048.06s]  What time is it? It's six
[28048.38s -> 28051.70s]  Man, do I wanna do I want to keep streaming or do I want to go to her?
[28051.70s -> 28059.10s]  Do I want to go get food and go to the gym? I can't like 24 hour fitness is not actually 24 anymore
[28059.10s -> 28068.02s]  So I'd have to go soon if I'm gonna go to the gym, but it is only like six
[28078.27s -> 28083.24s]  hmm, but I could just end on I
[28084.12s -> 28088.38s]  Could just end on the hitting the like 400 LP mark and just chill for now
[28088.96s -> 28093.93s]  Right like we have 400 LP. We'll probably hit GM tomorrow
[28095.65s -> 28098.39s]  So I could just chill for now and then we can just hit GM tomorrow
[28101.05s -> 28103.05s]  That's probably a better idea
[28103.05s -> 28107.99s]  Because then I won't get mad like say say we get like like say we get another game like this, right?
[28109.31s -> 28114.31s]  Like say we get another game like this where like we're literally winning the game and my team's like no
[28114.31s -> 28118.19s]  Let's forfeit like that's gonna make me mad. I was mad. This is gonna make me mad, right? Like I
[28118.77s -> 28123.21s]  So I'd rather just like get off on a good note like a happy note, you know, like not be tilted
[28129.60s -> 28133.60s]  GM tomorrow. Yeah, I hope so. I've been I think I can get challenger back this year
[28133.60s -> 28138.76s]  But we got to get to GM first. I'm telling you I this elo is so miserable
[28139.04s -> 28149.96s]  Like, Master Tier is the worst elo I've ever played in in my 12 years of playing this game.
[28149.96s -> 28157.66s]  Whatever NA 300-400 LP Masters is, is literally disgusting.
[28157.66s -> 28159.76s]  These are not real people.
[28159.76s -> 28167.24s]  I feel like half these games we are playing with NPCs who quite literally don't even
[28167.24s -> 28171.54s]  like I don't even know what to say they're bots and they can't be real
[28171.54s -> 28176.44s]  humans they get mad over nothing they rage quit over nothing they they give
[28176.44s -> 28180.84s]  up at 15 minutes when we're winning the game these cannot be real people
[28180.84s -> 28188.35s]  so I swear to God the game has to get better in GM it has to get better
[28188.35s -> 28196.27s]  there's no world that it gets worse like I refuse to believe that because
[28196.27s -> 28207.69s]  This is this is the worst grind I've ever had. Is it bad to be a bot? Are you saying I'm boddist?
[28209.96s -> 28216.58s]  Everyone cancel me because I because I because I don't like bots. I said it. I'm saying it. I don't like fucking bots. Well,
[28217.28s -> 28221.22s]  Okay, I didn't need to add fuck. You know what? We're just gonna I'm gonna get off. I'm gonna yeah, that's it
[28221.22s -> 28222.86s]  That's it for me
[28222.86s -> 28228.64s]  I'm gonna get off boys. I'm tired. I need to go to the gym before I run out of juice make some dinner
[28228.64s -> 28233.22s]  I will be live tomorrow same time as today. I've been starting my stream at 10 a.m
[28233.60s -> 28235.52s]  My time.
[28235.52s -> 28238.82s]  Maybe I'll do it tomorrow at 9 a.m.
[28238.82s -> 28240.42s]  I don't know, it's 10 or nine.
[28240.42s -> 28242.18s]  Between there I always start my stream.
[28242.18s -> 28244.54s]  And so, and that's my time.
[28244.54s -> 28247.34s]  So it's like seven, eight, nine PST.
[28248.22s -> 28249.04s]  You're good at AD.
[28249.04s -> 28249.88s]  Thanks, man.
[28249.88s -> 28250.96s]  I think I suck.
[28250.96s -> 28255.38s]  My goal is hopefully I can get Challenger back.
[28255.38s -> 28257.80s]  And then I'm not gonna play,
[28257.80s -> 28260.04s]  like I just want to, my goal is Challenger
[28260.04s -> 28262.52s]  so that I can prove to myself.
[28262.52s -> 28267.04s]  It's a really stupid thing, but I want to prove to myself that I can still do it at 32
[28267.56s -> 28270.52s]  Because 10 years ago was the first time I started streaming this year, right?
[28270.52s -> 28272.28s]  I've been streaming for 10 years this year
[28272.92s -> 28274.18s]  And so I want to get Challenger
[28275.34s -> 28277.34s]  Because when I first started streaming, I was in Challenger
[28277.34s -> 28280.04s]  And I want to see if, like, after 10 years, I can still do it
[28282.20s -> 28283.56s]  And then I'm never gonna care again
[28284.74s -> 28287.32s]  This will be the only time I ever give a shit about getting Challenger
[28287.76s -> 28290.82s]  I just want to get it, see if I care, and then play for content, you know?
[28290.82s -> 28296.94s]  but uh yeah it's just like welcome to the league of Draven
[28296.94s -> 28301.16s]  CF the old man who has fucking arthritis and
[28301.16s -> 28305.18s]  fucking carpal tunnel and all that shit you know what I mean. See if I can still do it
[28305.18s -> 28310.12s]  Yo thank you for the twitch prime man I appreciate it thank you so much
[28310.12s -> 28314.06s]  appreciate it a lot dude. Alright guys that's gonna be it for me if you like the stream
[28314.06s -> 28314.84s]  don't forget to follow
[28314.84s -> 28317.92s]  all my socials and TikTok and Facebook and Instagram and all that shits
[28317.92s -> 28320.82s]  All the clickable garbage is underneath the stream. Don't forget to check it out
[28322.06s -> 28324.42s]  I'll be back tomorrow same time in the morning. I
[28325.74s -> 28328.98s]  Tomorrow's my last day for the weekend though. I'm not gonna stream on Saturday
[28328.98s -> 28334.78s]  I might do some off off stream grinding on Saturday. I've been taking I've been like forcing myself to take a day off of
[28334.78s -> 28335.78s]  streaming
[28335.78s -> 28341.34s]  Every week just so like I can mentally recharge and I think it's actually been really good for my stream
[28341.74s -> 28345.70s]  because like I've been in a much better mood while streaming and I've been much less tilted and I've been
[28345.70s -> 28352.30s]  Even if I play League off stream or whatever it's just like it doesn't feel as forced so I feel like the breaks nice
[28352.30s -> 28357.60s]  So yeah tomorrow no stream on Saturday tomorrow for sure and Sunday. I might I might do a short stream
[28357.98s -> 28361.42s]  But yeah, I'll see you guys then. Thanks for watching. I appreciate you guys and
[28363.78s -> 28370.58s]  Yeah, that's it. I'm gonna go make dinner. I hope you guys have a good night day wherever the fuck you are
[28371.30s -> 28376.58s]  Later dudes. Hope you guys have a good one. It was fun playing with Andromeda. Good luck on the games
[28376.58s -> 28380.82s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow. Peace!
