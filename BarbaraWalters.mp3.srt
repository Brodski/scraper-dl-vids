00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
We want to take a moment to pay tribute to Barbara Walter.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,240
She was a trailblazing journalist who spent more than half a century in broadcast news

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,840
throughout her iconic career.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,680
Barbara Walter shattered glass ceiling after glass ceiling, breaking bears,

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,920
and an industry once dominated by men.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,400
And paving the way for today's female journalists.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,320
She was the first ever woman to co-host NBC's Today Show.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,880
And later, the first woman to anchor a network evening news broadcast.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,600
In a tweet on Saturday, President Biden said, quote,

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,520
Barbara Walter's has always been an example of bravery and truth breaking barriers while driving

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,400
our nation forward. Her legacy will continue as an inspiration for all journalists.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,840
Barbara Walter's conducted hundreds of interviews with newsmakers from the world of politics,

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,880
sports, and entertainment. She was famous for asking tough questions and sometimes uncomfortable

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,600
questions and forgetting some of the world's most famous people to reveal parts of themselves,

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,120
the public had not seen before. Here she was on Meet the Press back in February 1976,

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,240
pressing then the Prime Minister of Israel.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,040
We'll have the first questions now from Barbara Walters of NBC News.

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,720
Mr. Prime Minister, you have repeatedly said in your speeches that a

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,480
militarily strong Israel is necessary to maintain the peace.

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,280
Now, the Pentagon and the CIA have reported after their military analysis that Israel is more

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,400
than strong enough to deter any Arab aggression. Were you able to convince Congress and President

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,600
forward those who are responsible for deciding military aid to Israel that you are right

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,920
and that the CIA and the Pentagon are wrong?

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,240
Well, first of all, I'd like to thank the CIA and the Pentagon for complementing Israel

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:48,560
for its military strengths. But I believe that we need more than compliments. We need hard work.

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,080
Mr. Prime Minister, we've heard these arguments now back and forth for a year.

27
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,880
And I'd like to get back to my very first question, which was how do you expect to have a Geneva

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,560
conference? We convened without the PLO. Can you give us any sign, any hope, any direction?

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,560
Can you realistically be specific about one new action that's going to break the stalemate,

30
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,040
the same conversation back and forth that we've heard from the year? Has anything happened in

31
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,160
this week or are things basically the way they were before you came to this country?

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,600
I believe that there are basically two options. How to move to its peace.

33
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:49,040
Incredible to watch her do her work. Barbara Walters died on Friday in New York City. She was 93 years old.
